These forward-looking statements are based on Binah Capital Group, Inc.’s (the “Company”) management’s current expectations, estimates, projections and beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events, and are not guarantees of performance. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Annual Report, words such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The following factors among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:\n\n·our ability to comply with supervisory and regulatory compliance obligations;\n\n·the risk we may be held liable for misconduct by their advisors;\n\n·poor performance of our investment products and services;\n\n·our ability to effectively maintain and enhance our brand and reputation;\n\n·our ability to expand and retain our customer base;\n\n·our future capital requirements and sources and uses of cash;\n\n·our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\n·our ability to protect the proprietary information of customers and networks against security breaches and protect and enforce intellectual property rights;\n\n·our reliance on third parties;\n\n·the risk that an increase in government regulation of the industries and markets in which we operate could negatively impact our business;\n\n·the impact of worldwide and regional political, military or economic conditions, including declines in foreign currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar, hyperinflation, devaluation and significant political or civil disturbances in international markets;\n\n·the risk that claims, lawsuits and other proceedings that have been, or may be, instituted against Wentworth Management Services LLC or Kingswood Acquisition Corp. could adversely affect our business;\n\n·the risk that the market price of our securities may decline;\n\n·the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of the Company to grow its business and manage growth profitably;\n\n·costs related to the business combination;\n\n·changes in applicable Laws or regulations; and\n\n·the risk that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors.\n\n​\n\nii\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWhile forward-looking statements reflect the Company’s good faith belief, they are not guarantees of future performance. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company’s future results, performance or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section titled “ _Item 1A. Risk Factors_ ” in this Annual Report. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to the Company (or to third parties making the forward-looking statements).\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that the Company has anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in this Annual Report in the section titled “ _Item 1A. Risk Factors_.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements in this Annual Report should not be relied upon as representing the Company’s views as of any subsequent date, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n​\n\niii\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART I\n\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nThe Company\n\nBinah Capital Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its corporate headquarters located at 80 State Street, Albany, NY 12207, telephone number (212) 404-7002, Internet website address www.wentworthms.com. Our Internet website and content contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to incorporate into this Annual Report. References to “Binah,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” and similar terms mean Binah Capital Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Business Combination (as defined below), unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nThe Business Combination\n\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “ _Closing Date_ ”), the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 7, 2022 (as amended, the “ _Business Combination Agreement_ ” and the consummation of such contemplated transactions, the “ _Closing_ ”), by and among Kingswood Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (“ _KWAC_ ”), the Company, Kingswood Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ _Kingswood Merger Sub_ ”), Wentworth Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ _Wentworth Merger Sub_ ”), and Wentworth Management Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ _Wentworth_ ”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on the Closing Date, Kingswood Merger Sub merged with and into KWAC (the “ _Kingswood Merger_ ”), with KWAC surviving the Kingswood Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “ _Kingswood Surviving Company_ ”). Simultaneously with the Kingswood Merger, Wentworth Merger Sub merged with and into Wentworth (the “ _Wentworth Merger_ ”), with Wentworth surviving the Wentworth Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “ _Surviving Company_ ”). Following the Wentworth Merger, Kingswood Surviving Company acquired, and the Company contributed to Kingswood Surviving Company all of the common units of the Surviving Company directly held by the Company after the Wentworth Merger (the “ _Holdings Contribution_ ”), such that, following the Holdings Contribution, Surviving Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Kingswood Surviving Company (the Kingswood Merger and the Wentworth Merger, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “ _Business Combination_ ”).\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nThe Company is a leading consolidator of retail wealth management businesses that owns and operates ten entities, four of which are broker-dealers, three of which are registered investment advisors, and three of which are insurance entities, that have over 1900 registered individuals working within the financial services industries.\n\nThe Company focuses on three critical areas comprised of the hybrid, independent and W2 business models to allow affiliated advisors to choose the operating model that works best for them and run their practices on their own terms. The Company’s platform adds to its flexibility by providing a variety of custody and clearing firm options to accommodate the unique business needs of advisors.\n\nThe Company believes it will be a natural destination for financial advisors and assets in motion by strategically positioning itself as the hybrid broker-dealer of choice, with top clearing and custodial relationships and strategic partnerships. With a track record of building a platform capable of significant scale along with strategic initiatives to drive its growth via access to public capital, Binah’s features include:\n\n●| A national wealth management platform supporting more than 1,900 individuals working within the financial services industries  \n---|---  \n●| Tech-enabled capabilities that allows for seamless integration and provides advisors with end-to-end services enhancing efficiency  \n---|---  \n●| Open architecture that offers access to an array of solutions for advisors and their clients via expanded product offerings and shared services  \n---|---  \n  \n1\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| A highly attractive financial model that is expected to experience organic growth, highly recurring revenues and expanding margins  \n---|---  \n  \nEach of our independent advisory and brokerage firms provides full support services to its financial advisors, including access to stock, bond, exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and options execution; products such as insurance, mutual funds, alternative investments such as non-traded real estate investment trusts, unit trusts and fixed and variable annuities; and research, compliance, supervision, accounting and related services.\n\nOur independent advisory and brokerage firms offer various accounts, some of which are managed by our financial advisors, and others that are managed by third parties. The advisor managed accounts offer various account structures, including fee-based and “wrap fee” accounts. For financial advisors who prefer not to act as portfolio managers, third-party management options are available. These options employ managers who select diversified, fee-based asset management investment portfolios based on a client’s needs and risk profile. The types of portfolios may include separately managed portfolios, multi-managed accounts, and mutual fund and ETF model portfolios. These portfolios may also include portfolio analytics, performance reporting and position-specific reporting.\n\nCorporate Structure\n\nFounded in March 2016 as a limited liability company under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, Wentworth, through four wholly-owned registered broker dealer subsidiaries and their affiliated entities, provides investment management services to clients via three advisor business models:\n\nHybrid Business Model: The Purshe Kaplan Sterling Entities\n\nPKS Holdings, LLC (“PKSH”) is headquartered in Albany, New York with branch offices throughout the United States of America, more than 1700 registered individuals working within the financial services industries, and includes the following entities (the “PKSH Entities”):\n\n●| Purshe Kaplan Sterling Investments, Inc. (“PKSI”), incorporated in the State of New York, is an independent broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).  \n---|---  \n●| PKS Advisory Services, LLC (“PKSA”), a New York limited liability company, is an independent investment advisory firm, registered with the SEC, which provides advisory services to clients.  \n---|---  \n●| PKS Financial Services, Inc. (“PKSF”), incorporated in the State of New York, is an insurance entity providing financial services to clients.  \n---|---  \n●| Representatives Indemnity Company, Inc. (“Repco”), incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, holds a general business insurance license for the purpose of providing professional liability insurance coverage for affiliated Wentworth entities.  \n---|---  \n  \nPKSI operates under a Hybrid Business Model, which allows our independent registered representatives to maintain registration with our broker-dealer in order to continue to offer commission-based products alongside their registration to an outside registered investment advisor to provide fee-based asset management services. The flexibility of the Hybrid Business Model allows investment advisors to keep their fee-based asset management advisory business while executing their more traditional commission-based business through our broker-dealer.\n\nPKSI is one of the leaders in the Hybrid Business Model with over 500 different registered investment advisors that have advisors registered with PKSI. We are currently expanding the PKSI model into both World Equity Group and Cabot Lodge Securities to offer greater custody and clearing options to our advisors. Pursuant to the Hybrid Business Model, an independent financial advisor becomes affiliated with one of our independent brokerage firms. The independent financial advisor generally establishes his or her own office and is solely responsible for the payment of all expenses associated with the operation of the branch office (including rent, utilities, furniture, equipment, quotation systems, employee wages and benefits and general office supplies). A significant percentage of a branch’s commission-based revenues from securities brokerage transactions conducted through our brokerage firms accrue to the \n\n2\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nindependent financial advisor. Because an independent financial advisor’s fee-based asset management advisory business is outside of our corporate registered investment advisor, they run and manage all aspects of their own registered investment advisor and collect all fees related to those services. This compares with a payout rate of approximately 30% to 50% to financial advisors working in a traditional wirehouse brokerage setting where the brokerage firm bears substantially all of the sales force costs, including providing employee benefits, office space, sales assistants, telephone service and supplies.\n\nThe Hybrid Business Model permits our independent brokerage firm subsidiaries to expand their revenue base and retail distribution network of investment products and services without either the capital expenditures that would be required to open company-owned offices, or the additional administrative and other costs of hiring financial advisors as in-house employees.\n\nAn independent financial advisor must possess a sufficient level of business experience to enable the individual to independently operate his or her own office. These independent financial advisors have the ability to structure their own practices and to focus in different areas of the investment business, subject to supervisory procedures as well as compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nIndependent Business Model: the Cabot Lodge Entities and the World Equity Group\n\nCabot Lodge Securities LLC (“CLS”) maintains offices in New York, New York with branch offices throughout the United States of America, more than 100 registered advisors. and includes the following entities (the “Cabot Entities”):\n\n●| CLS, a Delaware limited liability company, is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and is a member of FINRA and SIPC.  \n---|---  \n●| CL Wealth Management LLC (“CLWM”), a Virginia limited liability company in the, is an investment advisory firm, registered with the SEC and provides advisory services to clients.  \n---|---  \n●| Wentworth Financial Partners LLC (“WFP”) (f/k/a CL General Agency), a Delaware limited liability company, is an insurance entity providing financial services to clients.  \n---|---  \n  \nWorld Equity Group, Inc. (“WEG”), incorporated in the State of Illinois, is registered as a broker-dealer and investment advisor with the SEC and is a member of FINRA and SIPC. WEG maintains offices in Schaumburg, Illinois and has branch offices throughout the United States of America.\n\nThe Cabot Entities and WEG operate primarily an Independent Business Model, which allows our independent broker-dealers to affiliate with our brokerage firms as independent contractors to offer commission-based products as well as fee-based asset management services to their client through our Registered Investment Advisors (“RIAs”). Pursuant to the Independent Business Model, an independent broker-dealer becomes affiliated with one of our independent brokerage firms as an independent contractor. The independent broker-dealer generally establishes his or her own office and is solely responsible for the payment of most of the expenses associated with the operation of the branch office (including rent, utilities, furniture, equipment, quotation systems, employee wages and benefits and general office supplies). A large percentage of a branch’s commission-based revenues from securities brokerage transactions conducted through our brokerage firms accrue to the independent broker-dealer, and a large percentage of the fee-based revenue for asset management services provided by our corporate RIAs accrue to the independent broker-dealer.\n\nW2 Business Model\n\nIn addition to the Hybrid Business Model, the PKSH Entities operate under a W2 Business Model, which allows our independent broker-dealers to affiliate with our brokerage firms as employees to offer commission-based products through our brokerage firms as well as fee-based asset management services through our RIAs. Pursuant to the W2 Business Model, the independent broker-dealer joins one of our established branch offices and Wentworth is responsible for the payment of substantially all of the expenses associated with the operation of the branch office (including rent, utilities, furniture, equipment, quotation systems, employee wages and benefits and general office supplies). The independent broker-dealer is a commission based on a smaller percentage of a branch’s commission-based revenues from securities brokerage transactions conducted through our brokerage firms, and the fee-based revenue for asset management services provided by our corporate RIAs.\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCompetition\n\nThe wealth management industry is highly competitive. We compete for opportunities and the professionals in our network compete for clients, advisers and other personnel, with public and privately held investment advisers, traditional brokerage firms and wirehouses, firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, private equity firms, asset managers and insurance companies, many of whom have greater resources than we do.\n\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Also, many firms offer discount brokerage services and generally effect transactions at substantially lower commission rates on an “execution only” basis. Moreover, there is substantial commission discounting by full-service brokerage firms competing for institutional and retail brokerage business.\n\nA growing number of brokerage firms offer online trading and web-based financial services, usually with lower levels of service, which has further intensified the competition for retail brokerage customers. Our brokerage firm subsidiaries currently do not offer any online trading services to their customers, although they offer online account access so their customers can review their account balances and activity.\n\nCompetition also is increasing from other financial institutions, notably banking institutions, insurance companies and other organizations, which offer customers some of the same services and products presently provided by securities firms. We seek to compete through the quality of our financial advisors, our level of service, the products and services we offer and our expertise in certain areas.\n\nTo grow our business and compete effectively we must be able to maintain our existing community and attract additional opportunities. Traditionally, we have competed on the basis of:\n\n●| increasing revenue through enhanced advisor recruitment efforts, expanded product offerings, strategic scale opportunities (M&A)  \n---|---  \n●| expanding margins through new product offerings on existing platforms, shared services, and improved operational efficiencies across our broker dealer network  \n---|---  \n●| increasing organizational scale via lift-out acquisitions, consolidation of other firms onto our existing platform, expanded partner networks and improved brand recognition  \n---|---  \n●| building out our tech stack and scaling through additional technology products  \n---|---  \n  \nCompetitive Advantage\n\nOur organizational structure differentiates us from our competitors. Our network enables highly qualified professionals to run their businesses efficiently and effectively through end-to-end resources and support, including:\n\n●| Clearing capabilities through major clearing and custodial firms  \n---|---  \n●| Ability to maintain their identity and enhance their brand  \n---|---  \n●| Flexibility to choose independent or corporate registered investment advisors  \n---|---  \n●| Knowledge and services sharing across the community  \n---|---  \n●| Seamless integration  \n---|---  \n●| Enterprise relationships  \n---|---  \n  \n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nGrowth Strategy\n\nAs advisors and assets under management continue to migrate from traditional wirehouse brokerage and commission-based platforms to hybrid and independent models, we believe we are well-positioned to expand our existing network and to grow through acquisitions.\n\nGrowth of Existing Network\n\nWe seek to enhance the competitive position of the professionals in our network by connecting our members with the intellectual expertise, resources and value-added services of our network. The Company intends to grow by supporting its members’ growth through tactical, operational and strategic initiatives, as well as through the members’ own acquisitions.\n\nPipeline Acquisitions\n\nWe continue to scale as firms consolidate into the Wentworth network and we add advisors via lift-out pipeline acquisitions. We leverage management’s existing relationships and experience to continue to identify and integrate partner and promote the Wentworth brand to the market.\n\nRegulatory Environment\n\nMost of the organizations and professionals in our network are subject to extensive regulation. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC and by FINRA. RIAs are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Advisers Act and by the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). Several organizations may also be subject to regulation by state regulators for insurance and other aspects of their activities.\n\nRegistered investment advisors are subject to numerous obligations, including fiduciary duties, compliance and disclosure obligations, recordkeeping requirements and operational requirements. Certain of our organizations sponsor unregistered and registered funds in the United States. These activities subject those firms to additional regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. In addition, many state securities commissions impose filing requirements on investment advisers that operate or have places of business in their states. Similarly, many states require certain client facing employees of RIAs and FINRA-registered broker-dealers to become state licensed.\n\nBroker-dealers and their personnel are regulated, to a large extent, by the SEC and self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. In addition, state regulators have supervisory authority over broker-dealer activities conducted in their states. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations which cover virtually all aspects of their business, including sales practices, trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers, employees and representatives. Broker-dealers are also subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital.\n\nCertain organizations have licensed insurance affiliates. State insurance laws grant state insurance regulators broad administrative powers. These supervisory agencies regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and other insurance intermediaries, and trade practices such as marketing, advertising and compensation arrangements entered into by insurance brokers and agents.\n\nOur organizations are also subject to regulation by the DOL under ERISA and related regulations with respect to investment advisory and management services provided to participants in retirement plans covered by ERISA and subject to regulation by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) pursuant to comparable provisions within the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Among other requirements, ERISA and the IRC imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and the IRC, respectively, and prohibit certain transactions involving related parties.\n\nAdditionally, we and our organizations are subject to various state, federal data privacy and cybersecurity laws designed to protect client and employee personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of client or employee personal, financial or other data could expose us to potential financial penalties and legal liability.\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s workforce was comprised of approximately 130 employees and substantially all employees are salaried. A significant portion of our workforce is comprised of compliance, operations, finance and other administrative personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have never experienced any work stoppages and we believe that our employee relations are positive.\n\nWe are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce where ideas and innovation can flourish and where individuals from every community feel a true sense of belonging. We are committed to this through how we hire, develop and recognize our talent. Our employees are a significant asset, and we aim to create an environment that is equitable, inclusive and representative in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our current and future business goals. We value agility, passion and teamwork, and are building a diverse environment where our employees can thrive and one that inspires exceptional contributions and professional and personal development to achieve our goal of being a natural destination for financial advisors and assets in motion as the hybrid broker-dealer of choice.\n\nMaterial Legal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as proxy and information statements and other information that we file, are available free of charge through our Internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC. Our Internet website and the content contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website at www.sec.gov, which also contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that we file electronically with the SEC. We routinely post important information on our website, www.gettyimages.com. We also may use our website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts.

RISK FACTORS\n\nRisk Factor Summary\n\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. Such risks include, but are not limited to:\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\nSeveral risks are inherent in the independent broker-dealer business model.\n\nCompared to wirehouses and other employee models, our advisors are not typically our direct employees. We generally offer advisors wider choice in operating their businesses with regard to product offerings, outside business activities, office technology and supervisory models. Our approach may make it more challenging for us to comply with our supervisory and regulatory compliance obligations, particularly in light of our de-centralized operations and the complexity of certain advisor business models.\n\nMisconduct and errors by our advisors could be difficult for us to detect and could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions, or serious reputational or financial harm. Although we have designed policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and interpretations, we cannot always prevent or detect misconduct and errors by our advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. Prevention and detection among our advisors, who are typically not our direct employees and some of whom tend to be located in small, decentralized offices, present additional challenges, particularly in the case of complex products or supervision of outside business activities. We also cannot assure that misconduct or errors by our employees or advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business, or that our errors and omissions insurance will be sufficient to cover such misconduct or errors.\n\nMisconduct by our advisors, who operate in a decentralized environment, is difficult to detect and deter and could harm our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nEven though our advisors are typically not our direct employees, we may be held liable for their misconduct that results in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct could include:\n\n●| recommending transactions that are not suitable for the client or in the client’s best interests;  \n---|---  \n●| engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity;  \n---|---  \n●| binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits;  \n---|---  \n●| hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses;  \n---|---  \n●| improperly using or disclosing confidential information;  \n---|---  \n●| failure, whether negligent or intentional, to effect securities transactions on behalf of clients;  \n---|---  \n●| failure to perform reasonable diligence on a security, product or strategy;  \n---|---  \n●| failure to supervise a financial advisor;  \n---|---  \n●| failure to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information;  \n---|---  \n●| engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of clients;  \n---|---  \n  \n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| engaging in improper transactions with clients; or  \n---|---  \n●| otherwise not complying with laws or our control procedures.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe cannot always deter misconduct by our advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Also, our failure to properly investigate new and existing advisors may subject us to additional risks and liabilities.\n\nPoor performance of the investment products and services recommended or sold to our clients or competitive pressures on pricing of such products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOur advisors’ clients control their assets maintained with us. These clients can terminate their relationships, reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, financial market performance, competitive pricing and personal client liquidity needs. Poor performance of the investment products and services recommended or sold to such clients relative to the performance of other products available in the market or the performance of other investment management firms tends to result in the loss of accounts. Competitive pricing, including from robo-advisors and higher deposit rates on cash deposits, could adversely impact our business. The decrease in revenue that could result from such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nMaintaining and enhancing our Wentworth brand and reputation is critical to our growth, and if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nSeveral competitors have brands that are well recognized. As a relatively new entrant into the digital market, we spend considerable capital to create brand awareness and build our reputation. We may not be able to build brand awareness, and our efforts at building, maintaining, and enhancing our reputation could fail. Complaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to consumers, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, whether valid or not, could diminish confidence in our brand, which could adversely affect our reputation and business. As we expand our product offerings and enter new markets, we need to establish our reputation with new customers, and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our reputation, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur subsidiaries are broker-dealers registered with the SEC and members of FINRA, and therefore are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny.\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries facilitate transactions in shares and fractionalized shares of publicly-traded stock and exchange-traded funds through a third-party clearing and carrying brokers. Our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and are members of FINRA. Therefore, our subsidiaries are subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators. The regulations applicable to broker-dealers cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, record-keeping, and the conduct and qualification of officers, employees, and independent contractors. As part of the regulatory process, broker-dealers are subject to periodic examinations by their regulators, the purpose of which is to determine compliance with securities laws and regulations, and from time to time may be subject to additional routine and for-cause examinations. It is not uncommon for regulators to assert, upon completion of an examination, that the broker-dealer being examined has violated certain of these rules and regulations. Depending on the nature and extent of the violations, the broker-dealer may be required to pay a fine and/or be subject to other forms of disciplinary and corrective action. Additionally, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers.\n\nThe SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators have the authority to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against broker-dealers, whether arising out of examinations or otherwise, for violations of state and federal securities laws. Administrative sanctions can include cease-and-desist orders, censure, fines, and disgorgement and may even result in the suspension or expulsion of the firm from the securities industry. Similar sanctions may be imposed upon officers, directors, representatives, and employees.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur subsidiaries have adopted, and regularly review and update, various policies, controls, and procedures designed for compliance with their regulatory obligations. However, appropriately addressing our subsidiaries regulatory obligations is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to appropriately address them. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may also result in regulatory sanctions or litigation against us. Our subsidiaries also rely on various third parties to provide services, including managing and executing customer orders, and failure of these third parties to adequately perform these services may negatively impact customer experience, product performance, and our reputation and may also result in regulatory sanctions or litigation against us or our subsidiaries.\n\nIn the event of any regulatory action or scrutiny, we or our subsidiaries could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs. In addition, any perceived or actual breach of compliance by our subsidiaries with respect to applicable laws, rules, and regulations could have a significant impact on our reputation, could cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to avert further breaches, and expose us to legal risk, including litigation against us, and potential liability.\n\nOur subsidiaries are subject to net capital and other regulatory capital requirements; failure to comply with these rules could harm our business.\n\nOur subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC and FINRA. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of their assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to limitation of its activities, including suspension or revocation of its registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA, and ultimately may require its liquidation. Currently, our subsidiaries have relatively low net capital requirements, because they do not hold customer funds or securities, but instead facilitate the transmission and delivery of those funds. However, a change in the net capital rules, a change in how our subsidiaries handle or hold customer assets, or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation, or amount of net capital requirements could have adverse effects. Finally, our subsidiaries are subject to such net capital requirements, we may be required to inject additional capital into our subsidiaries from time to time and as such, we may have liability and/or our larger business may be affected by any of these outcomes.\n\nIt is possible that FINRA will require changes to our business practices based on the ownership of our subsidiaries, which could impose additional costs or disrupt our business.\n\nIn certain cases, FINRA has required unregistered affiliates of broker-dealers to comply with additional regulatory requirements, including, among others, handling all securities or other financial transactions through the affiliated broker-dealer or conforming all marketing and advertising materials to the requirements applicable to broker-dealers. We do not currently believe that these types of requirements apply to any aspect of our business other than the securities transactions facilitated through our subsidiaries. It is possible that, in the future, FINRA could require us to comply with additional regulations in the conduct of other activities (i.e., beyond the securities transactions made through our subsidiaries). If that were to occur, it could require significant changes to our business practices. These and other changes would impose significantly greater costs on us and disrupt existing practices in ways that could negatively affect our overarching business and profitability.\n\nWe rely on clearing brokers and the termination of our clearing agreements could disrupt our business.\n\nEach of our four broker-dealer subsidiaries depends on the operational capacity and ability of its clearing broker for the orderly processing of transactions. By engaging the processing services of a clearing firm, each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries is exempt from some capital reserve requirements and other regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state securities laws. If these clearing agreements were terminated for any reason, we would be forced to find alternative clearing arrangements and could have an impact on our business.\n\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to find alternative clearing arrangements on acceptable terms to us or at all. Also, the loss of a clearing firm could hamper the ability of our subsidiaries to recruit and retain their respective independent financial advisors.\n\nOur business may be harmed by global events beyond our control, including overall slowdowns in securities trading.\n\nLike other brokerage and financial services firms, our business and profitability are directly affected by elements that are beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, changes in volume of securities and futures \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\ntransactions, changes in the markets in which such transactions occur and changes in how such transactions are processed. A weakness in securities markets, such as a slowdown causing reduction in trading volume in U.S. or foreign securities and derivatives, has historically resulted in reduced transaction revenues and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur business, operations, and financial position may be materially adversely affected by the geopolitical conditions resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the Israel-Hamas war, subsequent sanctions against related individuals and entities and the status of debt and equity markets, as well as protectionist legislation in our markets we operate.\n\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 and the Israel-Hamas war. In response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and Israel during the ongoing military conflicts, increasing geopolitical tensions. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and Israel is highly unpredictable, the conflicts could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in energy and other commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. Additionally, these and any other military actions and any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets.\n\nAny of the abovementioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, and subsequent sanctions, could adversely affect the business and operations. The extent and duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, resulting sanctions and any related market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial, particularly if current or new sanctions continue for an extended period of time or if geopolitical tensions result in expanded military operations on a global scale. Any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the market for our securities.\n\nWe may require additional capital to grow our business, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\nTo the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected growth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, as well as market disruptions and other developments.\n\nHistorically, we have funded our operations, marketing expenditures and capital expenditures primarily through earnings. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.\n\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of Common Stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could require that a substantial portion of our operating cash flow be devoted to the payment of interest and principal on such indebtedness, which may decrease available funds for other business activities, and could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\n\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, maintain minimum amounts of capital and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our senior management team, key technical employees, and other highly skilled personnel.\n\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our senior management team, highly specialized experts, and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain, and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. If we are unable to attract the requisite personnel, our business and prospects may be adversely affected. Our founder, executive officers, key technical personnel, and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of our founder or any other member of our senior management team or key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic business objectives and could harm our business. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. Our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Moreover, if and when the stock options or other equity awards are substantially vested, employees under such equity arrangements may be more likely to leave, particularly when the underlying shares have seen a value appreciation.\n\nLegal, Regulatory or Compliance Risks\n\nLegislative, judicial, or regulatory changes to the classification of independent contractors could increase our operating expenses.\n\nFrom time to time, various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors’ classification to employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other benefits available to employees. Most of our advisors are classified as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax and employee benefit purposes. We cannot assure you that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the employee/independent contractor classification of these firms’ financial advisors. The costs associated with potential changes, if any, to these independent contractor classifications could have a material adverse effect on us, including our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use customer information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data, respect customers’ privacy or comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\n\nUse of our technology involves the storage and transmission of information, including personal information, in relation to our staff, contractors, business partners and current, past, or potential customers. Security breaches, including by hackers or insiders, could expose confidential information, which could result in potential regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, compliance orders, liability, litigation, and remediation costs, as well as reputational harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or customers’ information. Any of these incidents could result in an investigation by a competent regulator, resulting in a fine or penalty, or an order to implement specific compliance measures. It could also trigger claims by affected third parties. While we use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties designed to effect secure transmission of such information, we cannot guarantee the security of the transfer and storage of personal information.\n\nAny or all of the issues above could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers, or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines or other actions or liability, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThere are numerous existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using, cross-border transfer, and the protection of personal information and other data. The scope of these existing and proposed laws are changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. These laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches that are expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAny failure or perceived failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way we process data (including by way of our algorithms). In the event of a data breach, we are also subject to breach notification laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including U.S. state laws, and the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, compliance orders, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause customers to lose trust in us, all of which could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, new and changed rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection of customer information could cause us to delay planned uses and disclosures of data to comply with applicable privacy and data protection requirements. Moreover, if third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations also may put personal information at risk, which may result in increased regulatory scrutiny and have a material adverse effect to our reputation, business, and operating results.\n\nRegulators may limit our ability to expand or implement and/or may eliminate or restrict the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue to expand and implement our proprietary product. Changes to existing regulations, their interpretation or implementation, or new regulations could impede our use of this technology or require that we disclose our proprietary technology to our competitors, which could impair our competitive position and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLitigation and legal proceedings filed by or against us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLitigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, complaints from or litigation by customers or reinsurers, related to alleged breaches of contract or otherwise. As our market share increases, competitors may pursue litigation to require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. We continually face risks associated with litigation of various types arising in the normal course of our business operations, including disputes relating to general commercial and corporate litigation. We are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, consumers, or affinity partners. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business. If we were to be involved in litigation and it was determined adversely, it could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even claims without merit can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, routine lawsuits over claims that are not individually material could in the future become material if aggregated with a substantial number of similar lawsuits. In addition to increasing costs, a significant volume of customer complaints or litigation could adversely affect our brand and reputation, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable. We cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation or other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation, and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition.\n\nWe may be subject to certain industry regulations, including the Truth-in-Lending Act.\n\nOur business may require compliance with certain regulatory regimes, including some applicable to consumer lending. In particular, the laws which our business may be subject to directly or indirectly include the Truth-in-Lending Act, and its implementing Regulation Z, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions. Non-compliance with the Truth-in-Lending Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, or other adverse consequences.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nChanges in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, the U.S. federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), enacted in December 2017, resulted in fundamental changes to the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), including, among many other things, a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, a limitation on the deductibility of certain director and officer compensation expense, limitations on the use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers and changes relating to the scope and timing of U.S. taxation on earnings from international business operations. Subsequent legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), enacted on March 27, 2020, relaxed certain of the limitations imposed by the TCJA for certain taxable years, including the limitation on the use and carryback of net operating losses and the limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense. The exact impact of the TCJA and the CARES Act for future years is difficult to quantify, but these changes could materially adversely affect holders of our common stock. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by “covered corporations” beginning in 2023. Other changes could be enacted in the future to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest or effect other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such changes could also include increases in state taxes and other changes to state tax laws to replenish state and local government finances depleted by costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in tax revenues due to the accompanying economic downturn.\n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate and tax liability are based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations, and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the Company and its diverse set of business arrangements is often open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets. The tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of laws, regulations, and treaties, resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to its income tax provision that could increase its effective tax rate. Changes to tax laws may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\n\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\n\nWe operate a global business and may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. These laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In many foreign countries, including countries in which we may conduct business, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We face significant risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or other parties or representatives fail to comply with these laws and governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe have begun to implement an anti-corruption compliance program and policies, procedures and training designed to foster compliance with these laws; however, our employees, contractors, and agents, and companies to which we outsource some of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.\n\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal, or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nbusiness, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\n\nRisks Relating to Cybersecurity and Technology\n\nSecurity incidents or real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our systems or our website could impair our operations, result in loss of personal customer information, damage our reputation, and brand, and harm our business and operating results.\n\nOur continued success is dependent on our systems, applications, and software continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. We rely on our technology and engineering staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our systems and services in an efficient and secure manner. Like all information systems and technology, our website may contain material errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs, particularly when new features or capabilities are released, and may be subject to computer viruses or malicious code, break-ins, phishing impersonation attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, as well as unintentional incidents causing data leakage, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or website or online app shutdowns, or could cause loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of personal or other confidential information.\n\nIf we experience compromises to our security that result in technology performance, integrity, or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our website or the loss or unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration or use of confidential information, customers may lose trust and confidence in us, and customers may decrease the use of our website or stop using our website entirely. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often they are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Even if we take steps that we believe are adequate to protect us from cyber threats, hacking against our competitors or other companies could create the perception among our customers or potential customers that our website is not safe to use.\n\nA significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems, software, or services may harm our reputation, impair our ability to operate, retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\nWe may be unable to prevent or address the misappropriation of our data.\n\nFrom time to time, third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites or online apps may misappropriate data and attempt to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. If we become aware of such websites or online apps, we intend to employ technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites or online apps in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites or online apps operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the effect of the operation of such websites or online apps. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites or online apps, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\n\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\n\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock and warrants may be highly volatile and could decline significantly.\n\nSecurities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock and warrants in spite of our operating performance. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock and warrants will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including any of the risks presented under this section entitled “ _Item 1A_. _Risk Factors_ ” or presented elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and, among others, the following:\n\n●| our operating and financial performance, quarterly or annual earnings relative to similar companies;  \n---|---  \n  \n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;  \n---|---  \n●| the public’s reaction to our press-releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;  \n---|---  \n●| announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships;  \n---|---  \n●| any major change in the Company Board or senior management;  \n---|---  \n●| sales of our common stock by us, our directors, executive officers, principal shareholders;  \n---|---  \n●| adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;  \n---|---  \n●| short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock;  \n---|---  \n●| exposure to capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, realized investment losses, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and performance of insurance-linked investments;  \n---|---  \n●| our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance and prospects;  \n---|---  \n●| our dividend policy and whether dividends on our common stock have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;  \n---|---  \n●| perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;  \n---|---  \n●| regulatory or legal developments;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in general market, economic, and political conditions, such as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, potential recession, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism;  \n---|---  \n●| conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; and  \n---|---  \n●| threatened or actual litigation or government investigations.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. In addition, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq in particular have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\n\nMost members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about the Company or its business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our shares would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts-initiated coverage, and one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.\n\nAs a public company, we will become subject to additional laws, regulations, and stock exchange listing standards, which will impose additional costs on us and may strain our resources and divert our management’s attention.\n\nAs a company with publicly traded securities, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq and other applicable securities laws and regulations. These rules and regulations require that we adopt additional controls and procedures and disclosure, corporate governance and other practices thereby significantly increasing our legal, financial, and other compliance costs. These new obligations will also make other aspects of our business more difficult, time-consuming, or costly and increase demand on our personnel, systems, and other resources. For example, to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff, and provide additional management oversight. Furthermore, as a result of disclosure of information in this proxy statement/ prospectus and in our Exchange Act and other filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may give some of our competitors who may not be similarly required to disclose this type of information a competitive advantage. In addition to these added costs and burdens, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of the Company’s common stock, fines, sanctions, other regulatory actions, and civil litigation, any of which could negatively affect the price of the Company’s common stock.\n\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the federal district courts within the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. These exclusive-forum provisions do not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\n\nOur Amended and Restated Certificated of Incorporation (the “Charter”) provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our Charter or bylaws, or (5) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or federal court located within the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, in all cases subject to the court’s having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such Securities Act claims. To prevent having to litigate \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nclaims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the federal courts will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The Company’s Charter will not address or apply to claims that arise under the Exchange Act; however, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any action, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Charter and Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\n\nAlthough we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Charter and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision but will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\n\nAt Closing, the Company entered into Lock-Up Agreements with certain holders, pursuant to, and on the terms and conditions of which, subject to certain exceptions, such holders shall not transfer or make any announcement of any intention to affect a transfer of any of the equity interests of securities of the Company beneficially owned by the holder during the applicable lock-up period.\n\nFollowing the applicable expiration of the lock-up period, the holders subject to Lock-Up Agreements will not be restricted from selling shares of our common stock held by them, other than by applicable securities laws. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\nAs restrictions on resale end and registration statements for the sale of shares of our common stock by the parties to the registration rights agreement are available for use, the sale or possibility of sale of these shares of our common stock, could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the market price of our common stock, or decreasing the market price itself.\n\nOur quarterly operating results and other operating metrics may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult to predict.\n\nOur quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. As a result, you should not rely on our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial condition and operating results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\n\n●| our ability to maintain and attract new customers;  \n---|---  \n●| the continued development and upgrading of our technology platform;  \n---|---  \n●| the timing and success of new product, service, feature, and content introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market;  \n---|---  \n●| pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise;  \n---|---  \n  \n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;  \n---|---  \n●| the diversification and growth of our revenue sources;  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;  \n---|---  \n●| system failures or breaches of security or privacy;  \n---|---  \n●| adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs, including content costs for past use;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to insurance and consumer product regulations;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in our effective tax rate;  \n---|---  \n●| changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; and  \n---|---  \n●| changes in business or macroeconomic conditions, including lower consumer confidence, recessionary conditions, increased unemployment rates, or stagnant or declining wages.  \n---|---  \n  \nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results.\n\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly operating results or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of Company common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\n\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\n\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable, timely financial reports and prevent fraud.\n\nOur testing of our internal controls, or the testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we would be required to remediate in a timely manner to be able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act each year. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner each year, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\n\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” may make the Company common stock less attractive to investors.\n\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as a company qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” it will, among other things:\n\n●| be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;  \n---|---  \n  \n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| be exempt from the “say on pay” and “say on golden parachute” advisory vote requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”);  \n---|---  \n●| be exempt from certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of its executive officers and be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act; and  \n---|---  \n●| be exempt from any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or be required to deliver a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis).  \n---|---  \n  \nWe currently intend to take advantage of each of the exemptions described above. Further, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our operating results and financial statements may not be comparable to the operating results and financial statements of other companies who have adopted the new or revised accounting standards. It is possible that some investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and higher volatility in our stock price. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if (1) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue, (2) we qualify as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, or (3) we issue, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities held by non-affiliates. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to rely on these exemptions, or if taking advantage of these exemptions would result in less active trading or more volatility in the price of our common stock\n\nThe requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\n\nAs a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will be subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will likely strain our financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees.\n\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over, financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. If we have material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to prevent fraud.\n\nIn addition, we will be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when we cease to be an emerging growth company. We expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we have already engaged additional resources to assist us in complying with these requirements, our finance team is small and we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.\n\nWe also expect that being a public company and complying with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board and qualified executive officers.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\n\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. In addition, FINRA regulations restrict dividends in excess of 10% of a member firm’s excess net capital without FINRA’s prior approval. Compliance with this regulation may impede our ability to receive dividends from our broker-dealer subsidiaries. For more information about potential limits on our ability to receive dividends from our broker-dealer subsidiaries, see  _”We are subject to various regulatory requirements, which, if not complied with, could result in the restriction of the conduct or growth of our business”_ above.\n\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.\n\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt, or a combination of both. However, the lapse or waiver of any lock up restrictions or any sale or perception of a possible sale by our stockholders, and any related decline in the market price of our common stock, could impair our ability to raise capital. Separately, additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to the Company’s common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on the common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\n\nThe forecasts of market growth and other projections included in this proxy statement/prospectus may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at a similar rate, if at all.\n\nGrowth forecasts and projections are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The forecasts in this proxy statement/prospectus relating to the expected growth in the direct to consumer vehicle and consumer product protection plan market, including estimates based on our own internal survey data, as well as any corresponding projections related to our potential performance, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets experience the forecasted growth described in this proxy statement/prospectus, we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\n\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if it becomes subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact its stock price.\n\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Stockholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently. Volatility in the stock price of our common stock or other reasons may in the future cause it to become the target of securities litigation or stockholder activism. Securities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert managements and our Board’s attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect its relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist stockholder matters. Further, its stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and stockholder activism.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of our warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without a warrant holder’s approval.\n\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement, which provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, and that all other modifications or amendments will require the vote or written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants, and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants, a majority of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or common stock, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a Company public warrant.\n\nYour unexpired Warrants may be redeemed prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your Warrants worthless.\n\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant; provided that the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\n\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\n _Cybersecurity Risk Management_\n\nWe maintain written policies and procedures that outline the Company’s comprehensive information security program (CISP). The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has the responsibility for implementation and maintenance of the CISP. In addition to SEC and FINRA regulatory requirements, we leverage established security frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, as guides to continually improve our policies and procedures. In addition, our employees are required to complete a cybersecurity training program each year, which is supplemented with additional awareness efforts, including phishing campaigns and informational notifications.\n\nWe employ a variety of security tools and components to monitor, identify and block cybersecurity threats. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the Company has an incident response team (IRT) whose role is to respond quickly and effectively. The IRT utilizes an incident response plan for the implementation of the [its] incident response capabilities that provides (i) a definition of “reportable incidents/events”, and (ii) “metrics” for evaluating the IRT’s response capabilities and effectiveness. The checklist is periodically reviewed by the IT Department for lessons learned from both mock and actual incidents, and to assure compliance with most current industry best practices and latest regulatory developments. The incident response plan includes processes through which cybersecurity \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nincidents are escalated to the Company’s executive officers. To improve preparedness for a cybersecurity incident, we conduct tabletop exercises at least annually. These exercises are conducted by internal personnel.\n\nCybersecurity Committee\n\nThe mission of the Cyber Security Committee is to be responsible for the cultivation of a corporate culture that recognizes risk awareness and the development of the Company’s cyber security solutions, utilizing thought leadership, technology and systems, and development of applicable policies and procedures. Through its cyber security policy and procedures, the Committee will ensure effective collaboration and coordination between affected departments and staff in identifying and responding to both privacy and cyber security risks and events. The Committee will oversee the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide strategic framework related to the identification and prevention of cyber security threats as an integral part of the Firm’s risk management process, otherwise known as CISP. The Firm’s cyber security framework is intended to be “evolutionary”, requiring (i) periodic reviews, and (ii) testing of systems, that result in changes to Company policy and procedures, as cyber security issues and developments require. The Committee shall be composed of specified members of senior management, department heads and staff, who have been selected based upon their backgrounds and experience involving IT, Risk Management, Operations, Compliance, and Legal. The Committee shall have the discretion to engage and utilize the services of independent vendors, computer service providers (eSP’s) and consultants having expertise in the area of cyber security and IT.

Any reference to “Wentworth Management Services LLC” refers to the entities comprising the Binah Capital Group, Inc. business prior to the consummation of the Business Combination._\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nThe Company is a leading consolidator of retail wealth management businesses that owns and operates ten entities, four of which are broker-dealers, three of which are registered investment advisors, and three of which are insurance entities, that have over 1900 registered individuals working within the financial services industries.\n\nThe Company focuses on three critical areas comprised of the hybrid, independent and W2 business models to allow affiliated advisors to choose the operating model that works best for them and run their practices on their own terms. The Company’s platform adds to its flexibility by providing a variety of custody and clearing firm options to accommodate the unique business needs of advisors.\n\nOur Sources of Revenue\n\nOur revenue is derived primarily from fees and commissions from products and advisory services offered by our advisors to their clients, a substantial portion of which we pay out to our advisors.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2023 included net income of approximately $571,000 and total revenue of approximately $168.0 million, which compares to net income and total revenue of $910,331 and approximately $178.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nAsset Trends\n\nTotal advisory and brokerage assets served were $23.9 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $22.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Total net new assets were $(3.6) billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.6 billion for the same period in 2022.\n\nNet new advisory assets were $(531) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $98 million in 2022. Advisory assets were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which is consistent from the $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\n\nNet new brokerage assets were $(3.1) billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.5 billion in 2022. Brokerage assets were $21.8 billion at December 31, 2023, up 8% from $20.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\n\nGross Profit Trend\n\nGross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 4% from $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. See the  _”Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”_ section for additional information on gross profit.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nKey Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe focus on several key metrics in evaluating the success of our business relationships and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Our key metrics of Gross Profit and EBITDA are “non-GAAP financial measures.” Our management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined under the rules of the SEC, to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Gross Profit and EBITDA provide investors and analysts useful insight into our financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nGross profit is defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue. We consider our gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight into our core operating performance before other costs that are general and administrative in nature.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appears below in the footnotes to the table of our key operating, business and financial metrics.\n\nOur key operating, business and financial metrics are as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of and for the Years Ended December 31,**  \nOperating Metric (dollars in billions)| **2023**| **2022**  \n**Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| ​| ​  \nBrokerage assets| ​| $|  21.8| ​| $|  20.1  \nAdvisory assets| ​|  2.1| ​|  2.1  \n**Total Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| $|  23.9| ​| $|  22.2  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Net New Assets**|  ​| ​  \nNet new brokerage assets| ​| $|  (3.1)| ​| $|  1.5  \nNet new advisory assets| ​|  (0.5)| ​|  0.1  \nTotal Net New Assets| ​| $|  (3.6)| ​| $|  1.6  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nFinancial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​| $|  168.0| ​| $|  178.8  \nNet income| ​| $|  0.6| ​| $|  0.9  \nNon-GAAP Financial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​  \nGross Profit(1)| ​| $|  31.8| ​| $|  33.2  \nEBITDA(2)| ​| $|  6.8| ​| $|  6.3  \n  \n(1)| Gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue.

Although inflation, rising interest rates and volatile global markets were all headwinds the U.S. economy added roughly 494,000 jobs in the fourth quarter of 2023, while the unemployment rate averaged 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023, up slightly from the average in the prior quarter.\n\nOur business is also sensitive to current and expected short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by Fed policy. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Fed policymakers maintained the target range for the federal funds rate to 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\n**Please consult the Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including those described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “** Risk Factors**.”**\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Currently, we conduct business through one operating segment. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

We also generate interest income in accordance with our agreements with our clearing partners. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we record revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products.\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are recognized on the trade date or the transaction date, which represents the completion of the Company’s performance obligation because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer at a point in time. The rates at which commissions are charged to the customers range from 1% to 7% based on the investment product. Trailing commission revenues which are preliminarily related to the sales of mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of the Company’s advisors are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally based on a fixed rate applied, generally twenty-five to fifty basis points (25-50 bps) of the current market value of the clients’ holdings. Trailing commissions are generally received monthly or quarterly. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and the client’s investment hold period and the Company does not believe that it can overcome such constraints until the market value of the fund and the investor activities are known. The revenues will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\nThe Company is principal for the commission revenue, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing it obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenue is reported on a gross basis. See Note 4 — Revenues From Contracts with Customers within the notes to the audited \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nconsolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 for further details regarding our commission revenue by product category.\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of our commission revenue for years December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the years ended December 31,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2022**|  ​| **2022**|  ​| **$ Change**|  ​| **% Change**  \nSales-based| $|  74,525| $|  83,988|  (9,463)|  (11.3)| %  \nTrailing| ​|  85,334| ​|  88,416|  (3,082)|  (3.5)| %  \nTotal commission revenue| ​| $|  159,859| ​| $|  172,404|  (12,545)|  (7.3)| %  \n  \n​\n\nSales based revenue decreased by approximately $9.5 million or 11% year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022. Trailing based revenue decreased by approximately $3.1 million of 3% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022. The decrease in sales based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 is attributable to a decrease in the generation of transactional based products. The decrease in the trailing based revenues is primarily due to volatility driven declines in trail eligible assets.\n\nCommission revenue is generated from brokerage assets. The following tables summarizes the brokerage assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in billions):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Years Ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nBrokerage Assets|  21.8| 20.1  \n  \n​\n\nIncluded in the brokerage assets above are trail-eligible assets as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Years Ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nTrail-Eligible Assets|  14.8| 13.9  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes activity impacting brokerage assets for the years ended:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Years Ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nBalance – Beginning of period|  20.1|  23.1  \nNet new brokerage assets(1)|  (3.1)|  1.5  \nMarket impact(2)|  4.8|  (4.5)  \nBalance – End of period|  21.8|  20.1  \n  \n(1)| Net new brokerage assets consist of total client deposits less client withdrawals from brokerage accounts, plus dividends, plus interest.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balances less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market change over the same period of time.  \n---|---  \n  \nAdvisory Fees\n\nAdvisory fees represent fees charged to advisors’ clients’ accounts on the Company’s corporate advisory platform. The Company provides ongoing investment advice, brokerage and execution services on transactions, and performs administrative services for these accounts. These fees are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory fees generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAdvisory fees decreased by approximately 2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022, due to a net outflow of advisory assets.\n\nThe following tables summarizes the advisory assets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nAdvisory Assets|  2,087| 2,129  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes activity impacting advisory assets for the years ended:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Years Ended**  \n​| ​| **December 31,**  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nBalance – Beginning of period|  2,129|  2,518  \nNet new advisory assets(1)|  (531)|  98  \nMarket impact(2)|  489|  (487)  \nBalance – End of period|  2,087|  2,129  \n  \n(1)| Net new advisory assets consist of total client deposits less client withdrawals from custodial accounts, plus dividends, plus interest, minus advisory fees.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balances less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market change over the same period of time.  \n---|---  \n  \nInterest and other income\n\nInterest income includes amounts earned on balances held at the Company’s clearing brokers related to cash balances and margin balances. The Company’s clearing agreements include provisions that provide for a sharing of the interest income earned on such balances with the clearing brokers. The rate varies based on the clearing broker.\n\nOther income primarily includes amounts earned by the Company related to marketing and incentives earned from the sales of certain investment products by the financial advisors to its clients, primarily alternative investments, as well as sponsorship income.\n\nThe growth in interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022 is primarily related to an increase in interest rates and an increase in marketing revenue from alternative investments, and an increase in sponsorship revenue.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nCommissions and Fees\n\nCommissions and fees primarily consist of commissions paid to the financial advisors, technology costs associated with the platform for which the financial advisors operate their business, insurance costs and regulatory costs. Certain of the technology, insurance and regulatory costs are passed through to the financial advisors and any excess costs are included as fees within commissions and fees. The commissions and fees paid to the financial advisors are based on the advisory and commission revenue earned on each client’s account. The payout amount is production based, which is the gross revenue produced by the financial advisor, and varies based on the level of such production ranging from 50% to 95% of the revenue generated. The production levels begin at gross revenue of $15,000 up to $4,000,000 and up, and the payout rate starts at 50% and increases to a top payout rate of 94% for annual production of $4,000,000 and up.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table sets forth our payout rate, which is a statistical or operating measure and monitored to review that such costs of revenue remain consistent on a period over period basis:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the years ended December 31,**|  ​| ​  \n​| **2023**| **2022**| **Change**  \nPayout range|  77.96| % |  75.48| % |  2.49| %   \n  \n​\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the payout rate increased as compared to 2022 as a result of the addition of a team of financial advisors whose payout percentages range from 90-94%.\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits includes salaries, wages, benefits and related taxes for our employees.\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $0.8 million which is directly related to the decrease in headcount of approximately 6%.\n\nRent and occupancy\n\nRent and occupancy increased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 relating to a new lease agreement entered into by World Equity Group, Inc.\n\nProfessional fees\n\nProfessional fees includes costs incurred related to legal and accounting services. Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 decreased by $1.4 million, respectively, which is related to decrease in tax and audit costs related to the preparation and audit of the financial statements required to be included in the initial proxy and registration statements filed with the SEC.\n\nTechnology fees\n\nTechnology fees primarily represent infrastructure costs that support the Company’s technology and communications costs. Technology fees increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022.\n\nInterest expense\n\nInterest expense primarily includes interest associated with the Company’s credit facility and other debt obligations. Interest expense increased by $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 resulting from an increase in the interest rate of the credit facility.\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization relates to the use of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.

We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and, in particular, to our broker-dealer subsidiaries, PKSI, CLS, MSI and WEG. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our strategic, operational and regulatory liquidity and capital requirements under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets.\n\nParent Company Liquidity\n\nWentworth Management Services LLC (the “Parent”), the direct holding company of our operating subsidiaries, considers its primary sources of liquidity to be dividends and management fees from our operating subsidiaries.\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $20.82 million outstanding under our Senior Credit Facility with Oak Street Funding, LLC, net of debt issuance costs. The associated debt facilities are as follows:\n\nOak Street Funding, LLC\n\nOn April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Oak Street Funding LLC (“Oak Street”) in the amount of $25 million. This note payable bears interest at the prime rate (“Prime”) (8.50% as of December 31, 2023) plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term and a 3-month interest only repayment provision. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance of the Oak Street note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $17.6 million and $19.5 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 25, 2021, the Company entered into an additional promissory note with Oak Street in the amount of $4.1 million related to the acquisition of WEG (“WEG Note”). This note payable bears interest at Prime plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance of this note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $3.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\n\nUnder the Oak Street notes, the Company is subject to certain covenants as defined in the agreements. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the Company did not meet a certain debt service coverage ratio and subsequently obtained a waiver from Oak Street for such covenant violations. For the period from April 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial related covenants.\n\nThe minimum calendar year payments and maturities of the Oak Street notes as of December 31, 2023 were as follows **(in thousands):**\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  2,418  \n2025| ​|  2,702  \n2026| ​|  3,012  \n2027| ​|  3,357  \n2028| ​|  3,739  \nThereafter| ​|  6,239  \nTotal| ​| $|  21,467  \n  \n​\n\nOther promissory notes\n\nOn November 30, 2017, WMS issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.6 million to certain sellers in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities. These notes had a maturity date of May 17, 2023 and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes has continued to accrue until such time as these notes are paid.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nContingent consideration subordinated promissory notes\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration in the amount of $5.0 million to certain sellers. The conditions related to this contingency were met on November 30, 2018, and thus the notes have been issued to the sellers. These subordinated promissory notes had a maturity date of May 30, 2023, and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes has continued to accrue until such time as these notes are paid.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these promissory notes were approximately $12.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Related interest expense was approximately $0.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nOther commitments\n\nOther commitments include amounts due to members of Wentworth related to promissory notes entered into between certain members and Wentworth to provide for working capital. The outstanding balance of these promissory notes as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 are $5.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**(in thousands)**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $|  2,553| $|  5,362  \nNet cash used in investing activities| ​| ​|  (80)| ​| ​|  (327)  \nNet cash used in financial activities| ​| ​|  (2,701)| ​| ​|  (4,510)  \nNet change in cash flows| ​| $|  (228)| ​| $|  526  \n  \n​\n\n _Cash Flows from Operating Activities_. Net provided by operating activities was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31 2022, representing a decrease of $2.8 million or 52%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the the decrease in commissions receivable offset by decreases in commissions payable.\n\n_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.08 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.33 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily related to the decrease in the purchases of property and equipment.\n\n_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to cash used in financing activities of $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily related to the decrease in the distribution of capital during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Payments Due by period**  \n​| **Total**|  ​| **Less than 1 Year**|  ​| **1 - 3 Years**|  ​| **3 - 5 Years**|  ​| **More than 5 Years**  \n**Contractual obligations**|  ​| **(in thousands)**  \nLong-term debt obligations(1)| $|  21,467| ​| $|  2,418| $|  9,071| $|  9,815| $|  163  \nInterest payments| ​|  7,156|  1,901| ​|  4,112| ​|  1,142| ​| ​|  3  \nPromissory notes – affiliates(2)| ​|  12,177|  12,177| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \nDue to member(4)| ​|  5,169|  5,169| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating lease obligations(3)| ​|  4,501|  535| ​|  1,662| ​|  1,764| ​| ​|  540  \n​| $|  45,304| $|  17,032| $|  14,845| $|  12,721| $|  706  \n  \n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n(1)| Represents principal obligations related to the Oak Street credit facility that was entered into during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Represents the obligations under the amounts due to certain sellers of the PKSH entities.

Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Management exercises judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenue on a net basis). For additional information see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units.\n\nWe performed our goodwill impairment test as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The estimated fair value of the reporting units were determined using the market approach for each reporting unit, relying specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. As a result of the 2023 and 2022 annual impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting units was 257% and 266% greater than its carrying value, respectively. Since there have been no events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting units were below their carrying amount, interim goodwill tests were not considered necessary.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, economic trends and market conditions, changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies, unanticipated competition, discount rates, technology, or government regulations. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider other information, such as public market comparable and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Although we believe the \n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nassumptions, judgments, and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments, and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.\n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note 3 -  _Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,_ within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, to us.\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket Risk\n\nWe are subject to market risk resulting from operational risk events, which can require customer trade corrections. We also bear market risk on the fees we earn that are based on the market value of advisory and brokerage assets, as well as assets on which trailing commissions are paid and assets eligible for sponsor payments.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, $20.8 million (net of debt issuance costs) of our outstanding debt was subject to floating interest rate risk. While our senior secured term loan is subject to increases in interest rates, we do not believe that a short-term change in interest rates would have a material impact on our net income, given revenue generated by our share of the interest earned in our clients’ cash balances held at our clearing brokers, which is generally subject to the same, but off-setting, interest rate risk.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The Company performs certain credit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its counterparties and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its counterparties, establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts and, consequently, believes that its receivables credit risk exposure beyond such allowances is limited.\n\n​\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nITEM 8.

Our board of directors currently consists of ten members. The primary responsibilities of our board of directors is to provide oversight, strategic guidance, counseling and direction to our management. Our board of directors meets on a regular basis and additionally as required.\n\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. Currently, our board of directors is divided into the following classes:\n\n●Class I, which consists of David Crane and Joel Marks, whose terms will expire at the first annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025;\n\n●Class II, which consists of Daniel Hynes whose term will expire at the Company’s second annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2026; and\n\n●Class III, which consists of Craig Gould and David Shane, whose terms will expire at the Company’s third annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2027.\n\nAt each annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the initial classification, the successors to directors whose terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nWe adhere to the rules of Nasdaq in determining whether a director is independent. The Board consults with its counsel to ensure that the Board’s determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors. The Nasdaq listing standards generally define an “independent director” as a person that, in the opinion of the issuer’s board of directors, has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). The parties have determined that David Crane, Daniel Hynes and Joel Marks are considered our independent directors. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\n\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\n\nThe Board oversees the risk management activities designed and implemented by our management. The Board does not anticipate having a standing risk management committee, but rather executes its oversight responsibility both directly and through its standing committees. The Board also considers specific risk topics, including risks associated with our strategic initiatives, business plans and capital structure. Our management, including our executive officers, are primarily responsible for managing the risks associated with operation and business of the company and provide appropriate updates to the Board and the Audit Committee. The Board delegates to the Audit Committee oversight of its risk management process, and our other Board committees also consider risks as they perform their respective committee responsibilities. All board committees report to the Board as appropriate, including, but not limited to, when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterprise risk.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nThe Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, each of which has the composition and responsibilities described below.\n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nAudit Committee\n\nOur Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\n●| evaluating the performance, independence and qualifications of the Company’s independent auditors and determining whether to retain the Company’s existing independent auditors or engage new independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing the Company’s financial reporting processes and disclosure controls;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing and approving the engagement of the Company’s independent auditors to perform audit services and any permissible non-audit services;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control policies and procedures, including the responsibilities, budget, staffing and effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing with the independent auditors the annual audit plan, including the scope of audit activities and all critical accounting policies and practices to be used by the Company;  \n---|---  \n●| obtaining and reviewing at least annually a report by the Company’s independent auditors describing the independent auditors’ internal quality control procedures and any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review;  \n---|---  \n●| monitoring the rotation of partners of the Company’s independent auditors on the Company’s engagement team as required by law;  \n---|---  \n●| prior to engagement of any independent auditor, and at least annually thereafter, reviewing relationships that may reasonably be thought to bear on their independence, and assessing and otherwise taking the appropriate action to oversee the independence of the Company’s independent auditor;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing the Company’s annual and quarterly financial statements and reports, including the disclosures contained in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of such periodic reports, and discussing the statements and reports with the Company’s independent auditors and management;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing with the Company’s independent auditors and management significant issues that arise regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentation and matters concerning the scope, adequacy, and effectiveness of the Company’s financial controls and critical accounting policies;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing with management and the Company’s auditors any earnings announcements and other public announcements regarding material developments;  \n---|---  \n●| establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding financial controls, accounting, auditing or other matters;  \n---|---  \n●| preparing the report that the SEC requires in the Company’s annual proxy statement;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing and providing oversight of any related party transactions in accordance with the Company’s related party transaction policy and reviewing and monitoring compliance with legal and regulatory responsibilities, including the Company’s code of ethics;  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing the Company’s major financial risk exposures, including the guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and risk management is implemented; and  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing and evaluating on an annual basis the performance of the audit committee and the audit committee charter.  \n---|---  \n  \n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOur Audit Committee consists of Joel Marks, David Crane and Daniel Hynes, with Joel Marks serving as the audit committee chair. The Board has affirmatively determined that Joel Marks, David Crane and Daniel Hynes each meet the definition of “independent director” for purposes of serving on the audit committee under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq rules.

Following the Guaranty Termination Date (as defined in the employment agreement), Wentworth can terminate the employment agreement at any time with or without Cause (as defined below), further to the provisions in Sections 7 and 8 of such agreement; provided, however, that Mr. Gould may terminate the employment agreement at any time with or without Cause.\n\nDuring employment, Mr. Gould is permitted to manage and/or work on his brokerage, investment banking and investment advisory business (including, but not limited to, all brokerage and advisory accounts that Mr. Gould receives or shares compensation or fees on) (the “Book”) provided that managing the Book does not materially adversely affect performance of Mr. Gould’s duties to Wentworth under the employment agreement.\n\nMr. Gould’s initial annual base salary was set at $300,000, subject to increase from time to time. The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Gould will be paid discretionary bonuses based upon Wentworth’s and Mr. Gould’s performance. The employment agreement further provides that Mr. Gould remains eligible to receive commissions or fees payable in his role as a registered representative or investment advisor of any broker dealer or investment advisor affiliate of Wentworth pursuant to any agreement between Mr. Gould and such affiliate.\n\nOn or after the Guaranty Termination Date, Wentworth may terminate the employment agreement with or without Cause, or due to Mr. Gould’s death or disability. The “Guaranty Termination Date” means the date on which any and all personal guarantees by Mr. Gould in connection with any debt or other obligation or liability of Wentworth or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, any obligation of Wentworth or its affiliates to Oak Street Funding LLC or its affiliates), have been terminated.\n\nIn the event that Mr. Gould’s employment ends due to (i) termination for Cause by Mr. Gould, (ii) termination without Cause by Wentworth (upon providing 90 days’ prior written notice) or (iii) termination due to the death or disability of Mr. Gould, Wentworth will pay to Mr. Gould an amount equal to two times his then-current base salary, payable in 24 equal installments commencing immediately following such termination and every two weeks thereafter. In addition, if Mr. Gould timely and properly elects health continuation coverage under COBRA and remains eligible for it, Wentworth will pay monthly COBRA premiums for Mr. Gould and/or his spouse and dependents in the same amount paid by the Company prior to the termination date until the earliest of: (x) the one-year period following the termination date; (y) the date when Mr. Gould becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment; or (z) the date Mr. Gould ceases to be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage for any reason. Receipt of the severance pay and COBRA benefits is contingent upon Mr. Gould’s execution of a waiver and release agreement regarding employment related claims in a form satisfactory to Wentworth in its reasonable discretion, and only for so long as Mr. Gould has not violated his continuing obligations with respect to confidential information and non-solicitation of clients and employees of Wentworth.\n\nFor purposes of the foregoing, “Cause” triggering termination by Mr. Gould means: (i) any material breach of the employment agreement by Wentworth; (ii) Wentworth’s or members’ of the Board of Managers commission of any material act of dishonesty or a violation of the rules of FINRA or other regulator of the business of Wentworth; (iii) Wentworth requires Mr. Gould to move his principal business location, which is 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036 as of the date hereof, to a location more than 20 miles one way commute from that location; or (iv) a material diminution of Mr. Gould’s base salary, bonus or title relative to his base salary, bonus or title immediately in effect prior to such reduction. “Cause” triggering termination by Wentworth means a finding by Wentworth that any of the following exist: (i) Mr. Gould’s conviction of a gross misdemeanor or felony which substantially relates \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nto the business of the company; or (ii) a finding by FINRA or other securities regulatory body of a material violation by Mr. Gould of such body’s rules or regulations leading to a suspension of his duties for more than 90 days.\n\nIf Mr. Gould’s employment is terminated for any reason Mr. Gould (or his estate or personal representative, as applicable) will be entitled to receive within 30 days following the date of termination (i) all compensation earned and all benefits and reimbursements accrued and due through the effective date of termination including any unpaid annual bonus for the year prior to termination or any unpaid annual bonus for the year of termination which Mr. Gould would have received if he had remained employed, pro-rated based on the time employed during the year and (ii) reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses or professional fees that are reimbursable pursuant to the employment agreement.\n\nUpon his termination for any reason, Mr. Gould is subject to: (i) ongoing confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations until two years after the last payment required to be paid pursuant to the employment agreement has been paid; provided, however, that trade secret information will remain a trade secret not subject to disclosure for the longest period allowed by applicable law; and (ii) restrictive covenants of non-solicitation of employees and non-solicitation of customer and clients, each for a period of 24 months following termination of employment; provided, however, that if Wentworth breaches its obligations regarding final pay, severance pay and COBRA benefits, then the non-solicitation covenants will no longer apply to Mr. Gould. Further, the restrictive covenants do not prevent Mr. Gould from accepting employment with an organization that competes with Wentworth, directly or indirectly, or from servicing, managing and/or working in the Book.\n\nAgreement between Mr. Gould and Cabot Lodge Securities, Inc. (“Cabot Lodge”)\n\nMr. Gould has entered into an employment agreement with Cabot Lodge, dated January 5, 2015, in which he is employed as Chief Executive Officer and President of Cabot Lodge.

(“PKSI”)\n\nPurshe Kaplan Sterling Investments Inc. is party to an employment agreement with Ms. Katherine Flouton, effective June 1, 2021.

In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are currently exercisable, or will become exercisable within 60 days thereafter, are deemed outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the shares shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise indicated in the table or footnotes below.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Name of Beneficial Owners**(1)| ​| ​  \nDirectors and Executive Officers| **Number of Shares**| **%**  \nCraig Gould(2)| ​|  309,235| ​|  1.88| %  \nDavid Shane| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​  \nDavid Crane| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​  \nDaniel Hynes| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​  \nJoel Marks| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​  \nAll directors and executive officers as a group| ​|  309,235| ​|  1.88| %  \nFive Percent Holders| ​| ​| ​  \nMHC Securities, LLC(3)| ​|  9,011,653| ​|  54.79| %  \nWentworth Funding, LLC (4)| ​|  1,362,564| ​|  8.28| %  \nPPD Group, LLC(5)| ​|  1,384,323| ​|  8.41| %  \nKingswood Global Sponsor LLC(6)| ​|  1,100,000| ​|  6.68| %  \n  \n*| Less than one percent.  \n---|---  \n  \n(1)Unless otherwise noted, the business address of each of those listed in the table above is 80 State Street, Albany, NY 12207.\n\n(2)Represents shares held directly by Craig Gould.

committee of our board of directors has adopted a policy setting forth the policies and procedures for its review and approval or ratification of “related party transactions.” A “related party transaction” is any consummated or proposed transaction or series of transactions: (i) in which the company was or is to be a participant; (ii) the amount of which exceeds (or is reasonably expected to exceed) the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of the company’s total assets at year end for the prior two completed fiscal years in the aggregate over the duration of the transaction (without regard to profit or loss); and (iii) in which a “related party” had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. “Related parties” under this policy will include: (i) our directors, nominees for director or executive officers; (ii) any record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing if the foregoing person is a natural person; and (iv) any other person who maybe a “related person” pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the policy, the audit committee will consider (i) the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party, (ii) the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction, (iii) whether the transaction contravenes our code of ethics or other policies, (iv) whether the audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders and (v) the effect that the transaction may have on a director’s status as an independent member of the board and on his or her eligibility to serve on the board’s committees. Management will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party.]\n\n​\n\nITEM 14.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n​\n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\n​\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n​\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n​\n\n/s/ FGMK LLC\n\n​\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. \n\n​\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nApril 16,

Holdings is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of KWAC and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub are wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Holdings. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at closing, each of the following transactions will occur in the following order: (i) Kingswood Merger Sub will merge with and into KWAC (the “Kingswood Merger”), with KWAC surviving the Kingswood Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “Kingswood Surviving Company”); (ii) simultaneously with the Kingswood Merger, Wentworth Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Wentworth Merger”), with the Company surviving the Wentworth Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “Surviving Company”); and (iii) following the Wentworth Merger, Kingswood Surviving Company will acquire, and Holdings will contribute to Kingswood Surviving Company all of the common units of the Surviving Company directly held by Holdings after the Kingswood Merger (the “Holdings Contribution”), such that, following the Holdings Contribution, Surviving Company shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Kingswood Surviving Company (the Kingswood Merger and the Wentworth Merger, together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Business Combination”).\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the Business Combination will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization acquisition in accordance with FASB ASC 805-40, _Business Acquisitions_. Under this method of accounting, KWAC is expected to be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the consolidated financial statements of Holdings will represent a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company with the business combination treated as the equivalent of the Company issuing shares for the net assets of KWAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of KWAC will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the business combination will be those of the Company in future reports of Holdings.\n\nUnder the terms of the Business Combination, the aggregate consideration paid in the Business Combination was approximately $217 million, paid in the form of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Company Common Stock”) and assumed indebtedness.\n\nNasdaq Exchange Listing\n\nThe KWAC Class A Common Stock and KWAC Public Warrants are currently listed on the OTC Exchange under the symbols “KWAC” and “KWAC WS,” respectively. Certain of the shares of KWAC Class A Common Stock and KWAC Public Warrants currently trade as KWAC Units consisting of one share of KWAC Class A Common Stock and three-fourths of one redeemable KWAC Public Warrant and are listed on the OTC Exchange under the symbol “KWAC.U.” The KWAC Units will automatically separate into component securities of Holdings upon consummation of the Business Combination and, as a result, will no longer trade as an independent security.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Holdings received approval for Holding’s securities to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Holdings Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and its warrants will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “BCG” and “BCG.W”, respectively.\n\n​\n\nF-8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.** SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WMS and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation and impairment of intangible assets, the valuation of deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses, and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. For additional information see Note 4 _- Revenues From Contracts with Customers_.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds, all of which have original maturities of three months or less.\n\nRestricted cash represents cash held by the Company’s lender related to its credit facility. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, restricted cash amounted to approximately $0.4 million.\n\nThe Company regularly maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk from cash.\n\nReceivables\n\nReceivables, which amounted to approximately $10.5 and $13.0 million as of January 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively, represent amounts due to the Company from its clearing broker, clients, financial institutions and others. Receivables consists of unconditional amounts due to the Company and are reported at amortized costs. All receivables are uncollateralized.\n\n​\n\nF-9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.** SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses _._ The Company accounts for estimated credit losses on financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326-20, _Financial Instruments-Credit Losses_. FASB ASC 326-20 requires the Company to estimate expected credit losses over the life of its financial assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures as of the reporting date based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company records the estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance for credit losses. For financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis the allowance for credit losses is reported as a valuation account on the statement of financial condition that adjusts the asset’s amortized cost basis. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are reported in credit loss expense, if applicable. Management believes its risk of loss on currently recorded receivables is minimal and accordingly an allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, in the amount of $0.2 million.\n\nProperty and Equipment, net\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company depreciates its property and equipment for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the asset is placed in service, which range from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the initial lease term. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets, are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures, which extend the useful life, are capitalized. When assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the costs and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss on disposal is recognized.\n\nThe Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. No impairment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. An impairment loss will be recognized if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, to the extent that it does not exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill. No impairment of goodwill was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\nThere was no impairment of intangible assets recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 8 -  _Intangible Assets_ , for additional information regarding the Company’s intangible assets.\n\nDebt Issuance Costs\n\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as additional interest expense over the expected term of the related debt agreement. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.\n\n​\n\nF-10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.** SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company accounts for its leases in accordance with FASB ASC 842- _Leases_. The Company is a lessee in several noncancelable operating leases for office space. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception of a contract and when the terms of an existing contract are changed. The Company recognizes a lease liability and right of use (“ROU”) asset at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nROU assets. A lessee’s ROU asset is measured at the commencement date at the amount of the initially measured lease liability plus any lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received; plus any initial direct costs. Unless impaired, the ROU asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the amount of the lease liability (that is, present value of the remaining lease payments), plus unamortized initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease cost for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLease Liabilities _._ A lease liability is measured based on the present value of its future lease payments. Variable payments are included in the future lease payments when those variable payments depend on an index or a rate and are measured using the index or rate at the commencement date. Lease payments, including variable payments based on an index rate, are remeasured when any of the following occur: (1) the lease is modified (and the modification is not accounted for as a separate contract), (2) certain contingencies related to the variable lease payments are resolved, or (3) there is a reassessment of any of the following: the lease term, purchase options or amounts that are probable of being owed under a residual value guarantee. The discount rate is the implicit rate if it is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The implicit rates of the Company’s leases are not readily determinable; accordingly, the Company uses it incremental rate based on the information available at the commencement date for each lease. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rates by starting with the interest rates on its recent borrowings and other observable market rates and adjusting those rates to reflect the differences in the amount collateral and the payment terms of the leases.\n\nAccounting policy election for short-term leases. The Company has elected, for all underlying classes of assets, to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease commencement, and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company recognizes lease cost associated with its short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nSee Note 12 - _Leases_ for additional information.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWMS is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and therefore not subject to federal taxes. The Company is subject to certain state and local income taxes.\n\nThe PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG are taxable entities and are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company periodically evaluates deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce deferred tax assets, if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n​\n\nF-11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.****SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)\n\nThe Company accounts for taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.\n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable.\n\nThe determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. See Note 14 – _Commitments and Contingencies_ for additional information.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09,  _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures relating to the rate reconciliation, disclosure of income taxes paid, and certain other disclosures. The ASU should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,  _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ to improve the disclosures about reportable segments and include more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. This ASU also requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment, like the Company, provide all of the disclosures required as part of the amendments and all existing disclosures required by Topic 280. The ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThere were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 that materially impacted the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures**.**\n\n​\n\nF-12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**4.** REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products. The Company views the selling, distribution and marketing, or any combination thereof, of investment products to such clients as a single performance obligation to the product sponsors.\n\nThe Company is the principal for commission revenues, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing its obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are based on a percentage of an investment product’s current market value at the time of purchase. Trailing commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the period during which services, such as ongoing support, are performed. As trailing commission revenues are based on the market value of clients’ investment holdings, the consideration is variable, and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts. The constraint is removed once the value of the clients’ investment holdings can be determined.\n\nAdvisory Fees\n\nAdvisory fees represent fees charged to advisors’ clients’ accounts on the Company’s corporate advisory platform. The Company provides ongoing investment advice, brokerage and execution services on transactions, and performs administrative services for these accounts. This series of performance obligations transfers control of the services to the client over time as the services are performed. These revenues are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory revenues generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts. As such, the consideration for these revenues is variable and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts on client portfolio values. The constraint is removed once the value of the clients’ investments holdings can be determined.\n\nThe Company provides advisory services to clients on its corporate advisory platform through the advisor. The Company is the principal in these arrangements and recognizes advisory revenues on a gross basis, as the Company is responsible for satisfying the performance obligations and has control over determining the fees.\n\n​\n\nF-13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**4.****REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS**(continued)\n\nThe following table presents total revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by investment product for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the years ended December 31,**  \n**Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| **2023**| **2022**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  102,218| ​| $|  104,700  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  19,022| ​|  19,688  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  10,810| ​|  12,589  \nAlternative investments| ​|  6,141| ​|  12,320  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  21,668| ​|  23,107  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  159,859| ​| $|  172,404  \n  \n​\n\nThe following tables presents sales-based and trailing revenues disaggregated by product category for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Sales-based (Point in time)**| **2023**| **2022**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  52,209| ​| $|  53,530  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  5,422| ​|  5,623  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  10,810| ​|  12,589  \nAlternative investments| ​|  6,084| ​|  12,246  \n**Total Sales Based Revenues**|  ​| $|  74,525| ​| $|  83,988  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Trailing (Over time)**|  2023| 2022  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  50,009| ​| $|  51,170  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  13,600| ​|  14,065  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  21,668| ​|  23,107  \nAlternative investments| ​|  57| ​|  74  \n**Total Trailing Revenues**|  ​|  85,334| ​|  88,416  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  159,859| ​| $|  172,404  \n  \n​\n\nContract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by the Company’s customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and there is an unconditional right to payment. The Company records a contract asset when the Company has recognized revenue prior to payment but the Company’s right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenues (a contract liability) until the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had receivables from contracts with customers totaling approximately $8.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The opening balance of receivables from contracts with customers was approximately $10.0 million as of January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, the Company had no liabilities from contracts with customers.\n\nInterest and Other Income\n\nThe Company earns interest income from client margin accounts and cash equivalents. This revenue is not generated from contracts with customers. Additionally, the Company receives marketing fees and sponsorship income.\n\nF-14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\n**5.** DUE FROM CLEARING BROKER AND CLEARING DEPOSIT\n\nPKSI, CLS and WEG clear customer transactions through a clearing broker and, therefore, they operate pursuant to exemptions contained in Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

The standard establishes the following hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value:\n\n●| Level 1 - Inputs use quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 2 - Fair value measurements use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset or liability. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets and liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those assets and liabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \nCertain financial instruments are carried at cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. The carrying value of debt approximates their fair value since the interest rates on these obligations represent current market rates.\n\n​\n\nF-15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**7.** PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\n\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nComputer hardware| ​| $|  2,587| ​| $|  2,601  \nOffice furniture and equipment| ​|  971| ​|  1,010  \nLeasehold improvements| ​|  41| ​|  44  \n​| ​|  3,599| ​|  3,655  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization| ​|  (2,625)| ​|  (2,195)  \nProperty and equipment, net| ​| $|  974| ​| $|  1,460  \n  \n​\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment amounted to approximately $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**8.** INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Gross**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Estimated**|  ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Accumulated**|  ​| **Net Carrying**  \n​| ​| **Useful Life**|  ​| **Amount**|  ​| **Amortization**|  ​| **Amount**  \nPolicies and procedures library| 5 years| ​| $|  2,200| ​| $|  2,200| ​| $|  —  \nDeveloped technology| 7 years| ​|  1,600| ​|  1,391| ​|  209  \nTrade name| 10 years| ​|  3,500| ​|  2,129| ​|  1,371  \n**Total**|  ​| ​| ​| $|  7,300| ​| $|  5,720| ​| $|  1,580  \n  \n​\n\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows as of December 31, 2022:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| **Gross**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Estimated**|  ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Accumulated**|  ​| **Net Carrying**  \n​| ​| **Useful Life**|  ​| **Amount**|  ​| **Amortization**|  ​| **Amount**  \nPolicies and procedures library| ​| 5 years| ​| $|  2,200| ​| $|  2,200| ​| $|  —  \nDeveloped technology| ​| 7 years| ​|  1,600| ​|  1,162| ​|  438  \nTrade name| ​| 10 years| ​|  3,500| ​|  1,779| ​|  1,721  \n**Total**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| $|  7,300| ​| $|  5,141| ​| $|  2,159  \n  \n​\n\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets amounted to approximately $0.6 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets over the next four years is as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  560  \n2025| ​|  350  \n2026| ​|  350  \n2027| ​|  320  \n​| ​| $|  1,580  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nF-16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**9.** DEBT\n\nOn April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Oak Street Funding LLC (“Oak Street”) in the amount of $25 million. This note payable bears interest at the prime rate (“Prime”) (8.50% as of December 31, 2023) plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term and a 3-month interest only repayment provision. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance of the Oak Street note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $17,6 million and $19,.5 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 25, 2021, the Company entered into an additional promissory note with Oak Street in the amount of $4.1 million related to the acquisition of WEG (“WEG Note”).

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding balance of this note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $3.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\n\nUnder the Oak Street notes, the Company is subject to certain covenants as defined in the agreements. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the Company did not meet a certain debt service coverage ratio and subsequently obtained a waiver from Oak Street for such covenant violations. For the period from April 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial related covenants.\n\nThe minimum calendar year payments and maturities of the Oak Street notes as of December 31, 2023, are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  2,418  \n2025| ​|  2,702  \n2026| ​|  3,012  \n2027| ​|  3,357  \n2028| ​|  3,739  \nThereafter| ​|  6,239  \nTotal| ​| $|  21,467  \n  \n​\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement with Oak Street providing for, among other things, consenting to the Business Combination, and the payoff and restructuring of certain debt obligations. Additionally, the rate of interest being charged will increase at rate of .15% per annum until the interest rate reaches a maximum of 15.00%, provided that in no event the interest rate will not be less than 10.75% (the “Floor”). Additionally, in connection with the amendment the Company has agreed to pay a fee equal to $0.14 million (the “Deferred Fee”), which is due and payable in the amounts of $0.025 million and $0.115 million on June 12, 2024 and August 12, 2024, respectively.

These notes had a maturity date of May 17, 2023 and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes has continued to accrue until such time as these notes are paid.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration in the amount of $5.0 million to certain sellers. The conditions related to this contingency were met on November 30, 2018, and thus the notes have been issued to the sellers. These subordinated promissory notes had a maturity date of May 30, 2023, and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes has continued to accrue until such time as these notes are paid.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these promissory notes were approximately $12.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Related interest expense was approximately $0.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company paid approximately $3,5 million on these notes. In addition to the paydown, the noteholders agreed to forgive the remaining accrued but unpaid interest of approximately $3.8 million and entered into a new promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $5.3 million. The terms of this new promissory note provides for maturity on May 15, 2027 and carries an interest rate of Prime plus 1.00%, but no less than 7.50% per annum.\n\n**11.** DUE TO MEMBERS\n\nThe Company has entered into promissory notes with certain of its members to provide for working capital.

The Company classifies these leases as operating leases. These leases generally contain renewal options for periods ranging from 2 to 10 years. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the optional periods are not included in determining the lease term, and associated payments under these renewal options are excluded from lease payments used to determine the lease liability. The Company’s leases do not include termination options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants. Payments due under the lease contracts include fixed payments plus, for many of the Company’s leases, variable payments. The Company’s office space leases require it to make variable payments for the Company’s proportionate share of the building’s property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance. These variable lease payments are not included in lease payments used to determine lease liability and are recognized as variable costs when incurred.\n\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating lease cost| ​| $|  1,141| ​| $|  908  \nVariable lease cost| ​|  48| ​|  41  \nTotal lease cost| ​| $|  1,189| ​| $|  950  \n  \n​\n\nTotal lease cost is included rent and occupancy on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAmounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating leases ROU assets| ​| $|  4,332| ​| $|  4,524  \nOperating lease liabilities| ​| $|  4,381| ​| $|  4,527  \n  \n​\n\nOther supplemental information related to leases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating leases| ​| $|  466| ​| $|  673  \n  \n​\n\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating leases| ​| $|  319| ​| $|  998  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nReductions to ROU assets and lease liabilities as a result of lease termination during the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **2022**  \nROU asset| ​| $|  1,670  \nLease liability| ​| $|  2,189  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nF-19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**12.****LEASES**(continued)\n\n​\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating leases| 6.7 years| 8.0 years  \n  \n​\n\nWeighted-average discount rate as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nOperating leases|  5.5| %|  5.6| %  \n  \n​\n\nAmounts disclosed for ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities and reductions to ROU assets resulting from reductions to lease liabilities include amounts added to or reduced from the carrying amount of ROU assets resulting from new leases, lease modifications or reassessments.\n\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  768  \n2025| ​|  777  \n2026| ​|  767  \n2027| ​|  731  \n2028| ​|  731  \nThereafter| ​|  1,400  \n​| ​|  5,174  \nLess: Imputed interest| ​|  (792)  \nLease liability| ​| $|  4,382  \n  \n​\n\nSublease\n\nCLS entered into an agreement to sublease its former office space which expired September 2022.

PKSH elected to be taxed as a corporation. The PKSH Entities and WEG are taxable entities and are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only, which is the primary reason for the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate.\n\nThe income tax provision (benefit) for the years ended December 31, consisted of the following:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **2023**| **2022**  \nFederal:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCurrent| ​| $|  180| ​| $|  (174)  \nDeferred| ​|  (354)| ​|  512  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nState and local:| ​| ​  \nCurrent| ​|  119| ​|  181  \nDeferred| ​|  (30)| ​|  61  \nIncome tax provision (benefit)| ​| $|  (85)| ​| $|  580  \n  \n​\n\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \nU.S federal statutory rate|  21.00| %  \nState income taxes, net of federal benefit|  13.21| %  \nNon-deductible meals and entertainment|  6.32| %  \nDeferred adjustments|  (127.28)| %  \nNon-taxable pass through entities|  69.74| %  \nOther adjustments|  (0.48)| %  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nEffective rate|  (17.49)| %  \n  \n​\n\nDeferred Taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates.

These carry forward losses are available to offset future U.S. federal and state taxable income and are not subject to IRC Section 382 limitations. All federal net operating losses being carried forward were incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and therefore will carry forward indefinitely.\n\nValuation Allowance\n\nThe Company provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur in accordance with accounting standards that address income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur. The Company has considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income amongst other items, in determining its valuation allowance and has concluded that a valuation allowance is not warranted.\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n\nBased on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits is to record such interest and penalties as interest expense and other expense, respectively. There were no amounts accrued for interest or penalties on unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management does not expect any material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal and state jurisdictions. The Company is generally not subject to examinations for its federal and state returns for any periods prior to the 2018 tax year. The Company is not currently under examination for any tax years.\n\n​\n\nF-22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**14.** COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nLitigation\n\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\n\nThere can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe Company is a defendant or respondent in various pending and threatened arbitrations, administrative proceedings and lawsuits seeking compensatory damages. Claim amounts are infrequently indicative of the actual amounts the Company will be liable for, if any. Many of these claimants also seek, in addition to compensatory damages, punitive or treble damages, and all seek interest, costs and fees. These matters arise in the normal course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nIn many lawsuits, arbitrations, and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect management’s estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter.\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, management cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. The Company believes, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, dispute, or investigation will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the actual outcomes of such legal proceedings, claims, disputes, or investigations could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period as additional information is obtained.\n\nSettlement Agreements\n\nOn August 18, 2021, the Company entered into a 2021 Settlement Agreement with the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan whereby the Paying Parties, as defined, were to make six payments totaling approximately $3.7 million, which represented the remaining amount due plus interest. The members of the Company, under the terms of an agreement are jointly and severally liable for the full settlement amount. The Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2021 Settlement Agreement on February 17, 2022, which stipulated that payment terms of the remaining amount owed of approximately $1.5 million, plus interest to be paid during 2022. Such amount was satisfied in June 2022 and recorded as a distribution of members’ capital.\n\n​\n\nF-23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**14.** COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)\n\nIndemnification\n\nThe activities of the Company’s customers are transacted on either a cash or margin basis through the facilities of its clearing broker. In margin transactions, the clearing broker extends credit to the customers, subject to various regulatory and margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the customer’s account. In connection with these activities, the clearing broker may also execute and clear customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased.\n\nThe clearing broker monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires the customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.\n\nThese transactions may expose the Company to significant off-balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses which the customers may incur. In the event the customers fail to satisfy their obligations to the clearing broker, the Company may be required to compensate the clearing broker for losses incurred on behalf of the customers.\n\nThe Company, through its clearing broker, seeks to control the risk associated with its customers’ activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, management of the Company had not been notified by any clearing brokers, nor were they otherwise aware of any potential losses relating to this indemnification.\n\n**15.** RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nCertain of the Company’s subsidiaries earn revenue from entities that are controlled by a principal member of the Company as well as from entities controlled or by individuals that are members or officers of the Company. The revenue earned by the subsidiaries and amounts due to or due from these affiliated entities as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Revenue**|  ​| **Due from/(Due to)**  \nSubsidiary| **2023**| **2022**| **2023**| **2022**  \nPKSI| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  8| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —  \nCLS| ​|  1,000| ​|  1,491| ​|  (0.1)| ​|  —  \nWEG| ​|  —| ​|  4,123| ​|  —| ​|  —  \nTotal| ​| $|  1,000| ​| $|  5,622| ​| $|  (0.1)| ​| $|  —  \n  \n​\n\nThe revenue amounts and amounts due to and due from are included in commissions on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition, respectively.\n\nF-24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**16.** MEMBERS’ EQUITY\n\nIncentive units\n\nThe Company authorized a class of units designated as Incentive Units. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no Incentive Units have been issued.\n\n_Voting Rights_ - Incentive Units will generally have no voting rights, except as required by law.\n\n_Profit interest -_ Incentive Units constitute an interest in the profits of the Company. All Incentive Units received by a service provider are received in exchange for the provision of services by the service provider for the benefit of the Company.\n\n_Call Right_ - At any time prior to the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering or a Change of Control, following the termination of employment or other engagement of any service provider with the Company, the Company may, at its election, require the service provider to sell to the Company all or any portion of such service provider’s Incentive Units at the following respective purchase prices:\n\nFor any Incentive Units that have not vested pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or any award agreement (“Restricted Incentive Units”), under all circumstances of termination, a price equal to the lesser of their fair value or their initial cost (the “Cause Purchase Price”).\n\nFor any Incentive Units that have vested pursuant to the terms of the incentive plan or any associated award agreement (“Unrestricted Incentive Units”), the Cause Purchase Price, in the event of:\n\n●| Service provider is terminated with cause; or  \n---|---  \n●| Service provider resigns without good reason.  \n---|---  \n  \nFor the Unrestricted Incentive Units, a price equal to their fair value, in the event of:\n\n●| Service provider is terminated without cause;  \n---|---  \n●| Service provider resigns for good reason;  \n---|---  \n●| Service provider resigns for any reason after 5 years; or  \n---|---  \n●| Death or disability.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Put Right_ - At any time prior to the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering or a Change of Control, if a service provider’s employment or other engagement with the Company is terminated as a result of such service provider’s death or disability, and the Company has not delivered a repurchase notice within ninety (90) days of such termination, then, subject to certain other provisions, such service provider may elect to sell to the Company all or any percentage of the Unrestricted Incentive Units held by such Person at a price equal to the fair value of such Unrestricted Incentive Units as of the date of termination.\n\nF-25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**16.** MEMBERS’ EQUITY (continued)\n\nClass A Preferred Units\n\nThe Company authorized a class of units designated as Class A Preferred Units. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no Class A Preferred Units have been issued.\n\n_Voting Rights_ - Class A Preferred Units will generally have no voting rights, except as required by law.\n\n_Pre-Emptive Rights_ - Class A Preferred Units will have the right to purchase their applicable pro rata portion of any new securities that the Company may from time to time propose to issue or sell to any party after the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering.\n\n_Protective Provisions -_ For as long as the Class A Preferred Units are outstanding, the holders will be afforded certain protection provisions pursuant to the warrant holders’ rights agreement. There were no warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nClass B Preferred Units\n\nThe Company authorized a class of units designated as Class B Preferred Units. Effective September 4, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the holder of the Class B Preferred Units whereby beginning on September 30, 2023, monthly payments in the amount of $61,676 (inclusive of the principal and the yield) will be made to redeem the Class B Preferred Unit holders. The payment of the Class B Preferred Units are intended to be completed no later than eighteen months from the date or the agreement or upon the consummation of the contemplated Business Combination _._ As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 260,834 and 277,364 Class B Preferred Units are outstanding at a value of $2.6 million and $2,8 million, respectively.\n\n_Voting Rights_ - Class B Preferred Units will generally have no voting rights, except as required by law, and except that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding units of Class B Preferred Units is required to authorize the issuance of any units that are senior in any respect to the Class B Preferred Units.\n\n_Pre-Emptive Rights_ - Class B Preferred Units will have the right to purchase their applicable pro rata portion of any new securities that the Company may from time to time propose to issue or sell to any party between the date of issuance and the consummation of a Qualified Public Offering.\n\n_Conversion_ - Class B Preferred Units are convertible into Common Units (subject to adjustment as provided in the related operating agreements, rights and limitations) at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion price equal to (a) if the conversion notice date is on or prior to the date that is 6 months after the closing date, the result of $10,172,877 divided by the number of Common Units outstanding as of the conversion notice date. Or (b), if the conversion notice date is after the date that is 6 months after the closing date, the result of (x) enterprise value less net debt less aggregate Class B Preferred unreturned capital value of all outstanding Class B Preferred Units as of the measurement date (all as defined) divided by (y) the number of Common Units as of the conversion notice date. The Class B Preferred Units are convertible up to only an aggregate of 10% of the fully diluted outstanding equity interests of WMS.\n\n_Redemption_ - Class B Preferred Units are redeemable upon a change in control, the termination of employment of the holder or upon exercise by the holder on the third anniversary of the instrument. The redemption price of a Class B Preferred Unit shall be equal to the sum of (x) the Class B preferred yield in respect of such Class B Preferred Unit and the Class B Preferred capital value, (all as defined) less (y) the aggregate amount of all distributions made by the Company in respect of such Class B Preferred Unit.\n\n_Preferred Yield_ - Class B Preferred Units are entitled to a cumulative preferred yield of 2.06% per annum and a default rate of 9% per annum, compounded quarterly, on the sum of (a) the Class B Preferred Unit unreturned capital value and (b) the Class B \n\nF-26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**16.** MEMBERS’ EQUITY (continued)\n\nPreferred unpaid yield accumulated for all prior quarterly compounding periods. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the cumulative preferred yield amounted to approximately $0.3 million, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2023, and in connection with the Business Combination, the Class B Preferred units were redeemed in full for approximately $2,5 million.\n\nCommon Units\n\nThe Company authorized a class of units designated as Common Units, which have voting rights. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there are 1,325,433 Common Units issued and outstanding at a value of approximately $12.3 million.\n\nPriority of Distributions\n\nThe priority of distributions after making any required tax advances is as follows:\n\n1.| Pro rata to the holders of Class A Preferred Units on a fully diluted basis in an amount equal to the product of (a) the aggregate distribution amount; times (b) this group’s fully diluted membership interest expressed as a percentage of the overall fully diluted membership interest;  \n---|---  \n2.| Pro rata to the holders of Class B Preferred Units in an amount equal to any unpaid cumulative preferred yield;  \n---|---  \n3.| Pro rata to the holders of Class B Preferred Units in an amount equal to any unreturned capital contribution;  \n---|---  \n4.| Pro rata to the holders of Common Units in an amount equal to any unreturned capital contribution;  \n---|---  \n5.| Pro rata to the holders of Common Units and Incentive Units in an amount equal to any remainder.  \n---|---  \n  \n**17.** RETIREMENT PLAN \n\nPKSI maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for the benefit of its employees. Contributions to the PKSI Plan are limited to a maximum of 3% of employee compensation and are based upon employee contributions. Employees must be 21 years of age and employed for three months to participate. The PKSI contribution to the plan amounted to approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, WEG maintains a 401(k) plan for qualified employees. WEG matches 50% of employee contributions up to 3% of employee compensation, and may make discretionary contributions to the plan, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the plan agreement. WEG’s aggregate contribution to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.02 million and $0.03 million, respectively. WEG also has a separate profit-sharing plan, making discretionary contributions as defined in the plan, subject to certain limitations set forth in the plan agreement. The Company did not make a separate profit-sharing plan contribution for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**18.** NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Company operates four registered broker-dealers that are subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1). This requires the Company to maintain certain minimum net capital requirements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, all broker-dealers had net capital in excess of the required minimums.\n\nF-27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**19.** CREDIT RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS\n\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The Company performs certain credit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its counterparties and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its counterparties, establishes an allowance for credit losses and, consequently, believes that its receivables credit risk exposure beyond such allowances is limited.\n\n**20.** SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date up to April 16, 2024, the date that the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.\n\nF-28\n\n**Exhibit 4.6**\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES**\n\nThe Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “ _Common Stock_ ”), of Binah Capital Group, Inc. (the “ _Company_ ”) is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ _Exchange Act_ ”).\n\nThe following descriptions summarize the most important terms of our Common Stock. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Certificate of Designations and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K (“ _Annual Report_ ”) of which this exhibit is a part. We urge you to read each of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Certificate of Designations and the Registration Rights Agreement in their entirety for a complete description of the rights and preferences of our securities.\n\nCapitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Annual Report.\n\n**General**\n\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 57,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 2,000,000 shares of Company preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share and (ii) 55,000,000 shares of Common Stock.\n\nAs of the date of the Annual Report, there were 16,447,342 shares of Common Stock outstanding.\n\nAs of the date of the Annual Report, there were 1,500,000 preferred stock outstanding.\n\n**Classified Board of Directors**\n\nThe Company’s board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. At each annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the initial classification, the successors to directors whose terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. This classification of the Company’s board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the Company’s control or management.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nDividend rights\n\n​\n\nSubject to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time-to-time by the Company’s board of directors out of legally available funds.\n\nVoting rights\n\nExcept as otherwise required by law, each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters properly submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the voting shares are able to elect all of the directors.\n\nLiquidation\n\nSubject to applicable law, the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the preferred stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Company, the holders of shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them.\n\nRights and preferences\n\nHolders of Common Stock have no preemptive, conversion, subscription or other rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to Common Stock. The rights, preferences, and privileges of the holders of Common Stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Company preferred stock that the Company may designate in the future.\n\n**Preferred Stock**\n\nThe Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by the Company’s stockholders, to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences, and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms, and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the Common Stock. The issuance of Company preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of the Common Stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of the Company or other corporate action.\n\n**Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws**\n\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “ _DGCL_ ”). However, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains similar provisions providing that we\n\n​\n\nmay not engage in certain “business combinations” with any “interested stockholder” for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\n●| prior to such time, the Company’s board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the Company’s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by the Company’s board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2∕3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nGenerally, a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale or certain other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with that person’s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of the Company’s voting stock.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who would be an “interested stockholder” to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring the Company to negotiate in advance with the Company’s board of directors because the Company’s stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if the Company’s board of approval approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in the Company’s board of directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions, which stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\n\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Stockholder Parties (as defined therein) and their respective affiliates, any of their respective direct or indirect transferees of at least 15% of outstanding Common Stock and any group as to which such persons are party to, do not constitute “interested stockholders” for purposes of this provision.\n\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Company’s board of directors is empowered to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Company’s board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director in certain circumstances.\n\nAuthorized Common Stock and Company preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Common Stock and Company preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\n\n**Exclusive Forum Provision**\n\n​\n\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court of the District of Delaware), will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\n●| any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company. to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, creditors or other constituents, or a claim of aiding and abetting any such breach of fiduciary duty;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| any action or proceeding against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder (a) arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws (as each may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or waived from time to time);  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder);  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or any of its directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. However, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts with respect to all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ _Securities Act_ ”), as other provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation designate the federal district courts of the United States as the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of the Company’s securities. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provision. In such instance, the Company would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. However, there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n**Limitations of Liability and Indemnification**\n\n​\n\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that that the Company’s directors will be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, the Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Company’s directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to the Company or the Company’s stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors.\n\nThe Amended and Restated Bylaws also permit the Company to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures the Company’s officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in certain circumstances and insures the Company against the Company’s obligations to indemnify the Company’s officers and directors.\n\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against the Company’s directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and the Company’s stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to the Company’s directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n**Listing**\n\nThe Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “BCG”.\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe Company’s transfer agent and registrar is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.\n\n**Exhibit 31.1**\n\n**CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER**\n\n**PURSUANT TO RULE 13A-14(A) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,**\n\n**AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002**\n\nI, Craig Gould, certify that:\n\n1.| I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Binah Capital Group, Inc.;

(the “Company”) is adopting this policy (this “Policy”) to provide for the Company’s recovery of certain Incentive Compensation (as defined below) erroneously awarded to Affected Officers (as defined below) under certain circumstances.\n\nThis Policy is administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Committee shall have full and final authority to make any and all determinations required or permitted under this Policy. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties. The Board may amend or terminate this Policy at any time.\n\nThis Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10D-1 thereunder and the applicable rules of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed (the “Exchange”) and will be interpreted and administered consistent with that intent.\n\n**2.****EFFECTIVE DATE**\n\nThis Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation paid or awarded on or after the date of adoption of this Policy, and to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.\n\n**3.****DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n\n“Affected Officer” means any current or former “officer” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1, and any other senior executives as determined by the Committee.\n\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. In the case of Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Restatement, the amount shall reflect a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was received, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may determine the form and amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in its sole discretion.\n\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, whether or not such measure is presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock price and total shareholder return are Financial Reporting Measures.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n“Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based in whole or in part on the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. For purposes of clarity, base salaries, bonuses or equity awards paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards, strategic or operational measures, or continued employment are not considered Incentive Compensation, unless such awards were granted, paid or vested based in part on a Financial Reporting Measure.\n\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (i.e., a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error was corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (i.e., a “little r” restatement).\n\n**4**.**RECOVERY**\n\nIf the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall seek to recover and claw back from any Affected Officer reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is received by the Affected Officer:\n\n(i)| after the person begins service as an Affected Officer;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| who serves as an Affected Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation;  \n---|---  \n(iii)| while the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange; and  \n---|---  \n(iv)| during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company was required to prepare the Restatement (including any transition period within or immediately following those years that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year, provided that a transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year).  \n---|---  \n  \nIf, after the release of earnings for any period for which a Restatement subsequently occurs and prior to the announcement of the Restatement for such period, the Affected Officer sold any securities constituting, or any securities issuable on exercise, settlement or exchange of any equity award constituting, Incentive Compensation, the excess of (a) the actual aggregate sales proceeds from the Affected Officer’s sale of those shares, over (b) the aggregate sales proceeds the Affected Officer would have received from the sale of those shares at a price per share determined appropriate by the Committee in its discretion to reflect what the Company’s common stock price would have been if the Restatement had occurred prior to such sales, shall be deemed to be Erroneously Awarded Compensation; provided, however, that the aggregate sales proceeds determined by the Committee under this clause (b) with respect to shares acquired upon exercise of an option shall not be less than the aggregate exercise price paid for those shares.\n\nFor purposes of this Policy:\n\n●| Erroneously Awarded Compensation is deemed to be received in the Company’s fiscal year during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n2\n\n●| the date the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier of (x) the date the Board, the Committee or any officer of the Company authorized to take such action concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare the Restatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the Restatement.  \n---|---  \n  \nFor purposes of clarity, in no event shall the Company be required to award any Affected Officers an additional payment or other compensation if the Restatement would have resulted in the grant, payment or vesting of Incentive Compensation that is greater than the Incentive Compensation actually received by the Affected Officer. The recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the Re statement is filed.\n\n**5.****SOURCES OF RECOUPMENT**\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its discretion, seek recoupment from the Affected Officer(s) through any means it determines, which may include any of the following sources: (i) prior Incentive Compensation payments; (ii) future payments of Incentive Compensation; (iii) cancellation of outstanding Incentive Compensation; (iv) direct repayment; and (v) non-Incentive Compensation or securities held by the Affected Officer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may offset such amount against any compensation or other amounts owed by the Company to the Affected Officer.\n\n**6.****LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO RECOVERY**\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may choose to forgo recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the following circumstances, provided that the Committee (or a majority of the independent members of the Board) has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable because:\n\n(i)| The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the recoverable amounts; provided that the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented such attempt and has (to the extent required) provided that documentation to the Exchange;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| Recovery would violate home country law where the law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, and the Company provides an opinion of home country counsel to that effect to the Exchange that is acceptable to the Exchange; or  \n---|---  \n(iii)| Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  \n---|---  \n  \n**7.****NO INDEMNIFICATION OR INSURANCE**\n\nThe Company will not indemnify, insure or otherwise reimburse any Affected Officer against the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n\n**8.****NO IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER REMEDIES**\n\nThis Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce an Affected Officer’s obligations to the Company, including termination of employment, institution of civil proceedings, or reporting of any misconduct to appropriate government authorities. This Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n3\n"

Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transaction set forth in the Merger Agreement. Binah Capital was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of KWAC and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Binah Capital. On the Closing Date, Kingswood Merger Sub merged with and into KWAC, with KWAC continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital and Wentworth Merger Sub merged with and into BMS, with BMS continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital. Following the BMS merger, KWAC acquired, and Binah Capital contributed to KWAC all of the common units of BMS directly held by Binah Capital after the BMS merger, such that, following the Binah Capital contribution, BMS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KWAC.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Merger pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, KWAC is expected to be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the consolidated financial statements of Binah Capital will represent a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of BMS with the business combination treated as the equivalent of the BMS issuing shares for the net assets of KWAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of KWAC will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the business combination will be those of BMS in future reports of Holdings (See Note 3 – Mergers and Recapitalization).\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“condensed consolidated financial statements”) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation and impairments of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses, contingencies, and other matters that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management, necessary to represent fairly the results of operations for the interim periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and the differences may be material to the condensed financial statements.\n\n​\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n1.| **DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.\n\n2.| SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \n---|---  \n  \nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation and impairments of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses, and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. For additional information see Note 4 - _Revenues From Contracts with Customers._\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds all of which have original maturities of three months or less.\n\nRestricted cash represents cash held by the Company’s lender related to its credit facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 restricted cash amounted to approximately $0.4 million.\n\nThe Company regularly maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk from cash.\n\nReceivables\n\nReceivables, which amounted to approximately $10.3 million and $10.5 million as of January 1, 2024, and 2023, respectively, represent amounts due to the Company from its clearing brokers, clients, financial institutions and other. Receivables consists of unconditional amounts due and are reported at amortized costs. All receivables are uncollateralized.\n\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses _._ The Company accounts for estimated credit losses on financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326-20, _Financial Instruments-Credit Losses_. FASB ASC 326-20 requires the Company to estimate expected credit losses over the life of its financial assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures as of the reporting date based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company records the estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance for credit losses. For financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis the allowance for credit losses is reported as a valuation account on the statement of financial condition that adjusts the asset’s amortized cost basis. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are reported in credit loss expense, if applicable. Management believes its risk of loss on currently recorded receivables is minimal and accordingly an allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023 in the amount of $0.67 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n2.| **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. An impairment loss will be recognized if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, to the extent that it does not exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill. No impairment of goodwill was recognized for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\nThere was no impairment of intangible assets recognized for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFor the periods prior to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, BMS was treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and therefore not subject to federal taxes. BMS was subject to certain state and local income taxes. Additionally, KWAC was treated as a corporation and subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes.\n\nSubsequent to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, KWAC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, is the parent company of BMS, which is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, BMS is itself generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws, and any taxable income or loss is passed through and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including KWAC. KWAC is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to its distributive share of the items of the net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits of BMS. Additionally, Binah Capital Group, Inc., a corporation, is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes. \n\nKWAC, the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG are taxable entities subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company periodically evaluates deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce deferred tax assets, if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\n\n​\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**2.**| **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \n**Net Loss Per Share**\n\nBasic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of the Company’s preferred stock. Net income (loss) per share is not presented for periods prior to the Merger as such amounts would not be meaningful to users of the financial statements because the equity structure materially changed in connection with the Merger.\n\n**Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\n\nAs a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, the Company has issued and has outstanding warrants. The Company evaluates the warrants, to determine if such instruments should be considered stock-based compensation, pursuant to ASC Topic 718, and if not in the scope of ASC 718, if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480 and ASC Topic 815. The determination of whether the instrument should be classified as stock-based compensation or a derivative instrument, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\nWarrants issued to non-employees (the “Non-employee Warrants”) were not classified as stock-based compensation as there is no condition of employment such that the granting of the shares does not represent compensation. The Non-employee Warrants are classified as derivative liabilities under ASC Topic 480 or ASC Topic 815. Public Warrants to non-employees are measured at fair value on recurring basis, using the market approach based upon the quoted market price of Binah Capital Group, Inc.’s Public Warrants at the end of each reporting period. Private Placement Warrants issued to non-employees are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based upon the quoted price for similar liabilities (Public Warrants issued to non-employees) in active markets as of the end of each period.\n\n**Contingent Liabilities**\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. \n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable. \n\n**Emerging Growth Company Status**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and it thus may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**2.**| **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures relating to the rate reconciliation, disclosure of income taxes paid, and certain other disclosures. The ASU should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ to improve the disclosures about reportable segments and include more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. This ASU also requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment, like the Company, provide all of the disclosures required as part of the amendments and all existing disclosures required by Topic 280. The ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThere were no new accounting pronouncements during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially impacted the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n​\n\n3.| MERGER AND RECAPITALIZATION  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, (i) the holders of shares of KWAC’s common stock (“KWAC Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (other than any redeemed shares) receivedone share of common stock of Holdings (“Holdings Common Stock”) in exchange for each share of KWAC Common Stock held by them, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, (ii) 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock issued to Sponsor was placed by Holdings into an escrow account and will not be released to the Sponsor unless the dollar volume-weighted average price of Holdings Common Stock exceeds $12.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the four-year period following the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) the holders of each whole warrant to purchase KWAC Class A Common Stock receivedone warrant to purchase Holdings Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, (iv) 12 million shares of Holdings Common Stock, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, was issued to the equity holders of BMS in proportion to their ownership interests in BMS, (v) an additional 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock was issued to certain equity holders of BMS, (vi) 3,084,450 KWAC Private Placement Warrants held by Sponsor were forfeited immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination, and (vii) 3,084,450 warrants to purchase Holding Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share were issued to the equity holders of BMS in proportion to their ownership interests in BMS. As a result of the Business Combination, BMS became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, Holdings entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n3.| MERGER AND RECAPITALIZATION (continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nHoldings applied to have the Holdings Common Stock and Holdings Warrants listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbols **BCG** and **BCG.W** , respectively. Prior to the mergers, the KWAC Class A Common Stock and KWAC Public Warrants were listed on the OTC Exchange under the symbols “KWAC” and “KWAC.WS,” respectively.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Holdings received approval for Holding’s securities to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Holdings common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and its warrants will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “BCG” and “BCG.W”, respectively.\n\n4.| REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  \n---|---  \n  \nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products. The Company views the selling, distribution and marketing, or any combination thereof, of investment products to such clients as a single performance obligation to the product sponsors.\n\nThe Company is the principal for commission revenues, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing its obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are based on a percentage of an investment product’s current market value at the time of purchase. Trailing commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the period during which services, such as ongoing support, are performed. As trailing commission revenues are based on the market value of clients’ investment holdings, the consideration is variable, and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts. The constraint is removed once the investment holdings value can be determined.\n\nAdvisory Fees\n\nAdvisory fees represent fees charged to advisors’ clients’ accounts on the Company’s corporate advisory platform. The Company provides ongoing investment advice, brokerage and execution services on transactions, and performs administrative services for these accounts. This series of performance obligations transfers control of the services to the client over time as the services are performed. These revenues are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory revenues generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts. As such, the consideration for these revenues is variable and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts on client portfolio values. The constraint is removed once the portfolio value can be determined.\n\nThe Company provides advisory services to clients on its corporate advisory platform through the advisor. The Company is the principal in these arrangements and recognizes advisory revenues on a gross basis, as the Company is responsible for satisfying the performance obligations and has control over determining the fees.\n\n​\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n4.| REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents total revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by investment product for the periods ended September 30 _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n**Revenue From Contracts With Customers**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  24,873| ​| $|  26,614| ​| $|  74,943| ​| $|  77,455  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  5,129| ​|  4,149| ​|  15,037| ​|  13,860  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  3,201| ​|  3,165| ​|  8,790| ​|  8,737  \nAlternative investments| ​|  1,577| ​|  1,541| ​|  4,065| ​|  4,060  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  6,246| ​|  5,448| ​|  18,250| ​|  16,334  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  41,026| ​| $|  40,917| ​| $|  121,085| ​| $|  120,446  \n  \n​\n\nThe following tables presents sales-based and trailing revenues disaggregated by product category for the periods ended September 30 _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n**Sales-based (Point in time)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  10,796| ​| $|  13,051| ​| $|  31,826| ​| $|  39,461  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  946| ​|  1,198| ​|  3,471| ​|  3,982  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  3,201| ​|  3,165| ​|  8,790| ​|  8,737  \nAlternative investments| ​|  1,498| ​|  1,526| ​|  3,971| ​|  4,004  \n**Total Sales Based Revenues**|  ​| $|  16,441| ​| $|  18,939| ​| $|  48,058| ​| $|  56,184  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n**Trailing (Over time)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  14,077| ​| $|  13,564| ​| $|  43,117| ​| $|  37,994  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  4,183| ​|  2,951| ​|  11,566| ​|  9,878  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  6,246| ​|  5,448| ​|  18,250| ​|  16,334  \nAlternative investments| ​|  80| ​|  15| ​|  95| ​|  56  \n**Total Trailing Revenues**|  ​|  24,585| ​|  21,978| ​|  73,027| ​|  64,262  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  41,026| ​| $|  40,917| ​| $|  121,085| ​| $|  120,446  \n  \n​\n\nContract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by the Company’s customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and there is an unconditional right to payment. The Company records a contract asset when the Company has recognized revenue prior to payment but the Company’s right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenues (a contract liability) until the performance obligations are satisfied. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had receivables from contracts with customers totaling approximately $10.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The opening balance of receivables from contracts with customers was approximately $8.9 million and $8.6 million as of January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities from contracts with customers.\n\nInterest and Other Income\n\nThe Company earns interest income from client margin accounts and cash equivalents This revenue is not generated from contracts with customers. Additionally, the Company receives marketing fees and sponsorship income.\n\n​\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n5.| FAIR VALUE  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard establishes the following hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value:\n\n●| Level 1 - Inputs use quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 2 - Fair value measurements use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset or liability. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets and liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those assets and liabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \nCertain financial instruments are carried at cost on the statement of financial condition, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. The carrying value of debt approximates their fair value since the interest rates on these obligations represent current market rates.\n\n6.| DEBT  \n---|---  \n  \nOn April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Oak Street Funding LLC (“Oak Street”) in the amount of $25 million. This note payable bears interest at the prime rate (“Prime”) (8.00% as of September 30, 2024) plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term and a 3-month interest only repayment provision. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Oak Street note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $16.2 million and $17.6 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 25, 2021, the Company entered into an additional promissory note with Oak Street in the amount of $4.1 million related to the acquisition of WEG (“WEG Note”). This note payable bears interest at Prime plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of this note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $2.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\n\nUnder the Oak Street notes, the Company is subject to certain covenants as defined in the agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial related covenants.\n\nThe minimum payments and maturities of the Oak Street notes as of September 30, 2024, are as follows _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  598  \n2025| ​|  2,596  \n2026| ​|  2,950  \n2027| ​|  3,344  \n2028| ​|  3,788  \nThereafter| ​|  6,434  \nTotal| ​| $|  19,710  \n  \n​\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement with Oak Street providing for, among other things, consenting to the Business Combination, and the payoff and restructuring of certain debt obligations. Additionally, the rate of interest being charged will increase at rate of .15% per annum until the interest rate reaches a maximum of 15.00%, provided that in no event the interest rate will not be less than 10.75% (the “Floor”). Additionally, in connection with the amendment the Company had agreed to pay a fee equal to $0.14 million (the “Deferred Fee”), which was due and payable in the amounts of $0.025 million, which was paid on June 12, 2024 and $0.115 million, which was due and payable on August 12, 2024, respectively. On August 12, 2024, the Company and Oak Street entered into a Letter Agreement Regarding the Deferred Fee which provided for the extension of the August Deferred Fee Date from August 12, 2024 to September 30, 2024. Under the Letter Agreement Regarding the Deferred Fee, the amount of the fee was adjusted to $0.15 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not paid in full its obligations and accordingly paid Oak Street the Deferred Fee. As of and subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company continues to operate under the Credit Agreement as amended and outlined above.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n6.| DEBT (continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe amended Credit Agreement also includes a guarantee provision whereby each of the Company, KWAC, Holdings and MHC Securities, LLC are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, certain of the members of the Company provide guarantees under the Credit Agreement. \n\n​\n\n7.| PROMISSORY NOTES – AFFILIATES  \n---|---  \n  \nOn November 30, 2017, BMS issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.6 million to certain sellers in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities. These notes had a maturity date of May 17, 2023 and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes continued to accrue until such time as these notes were paid or restructured.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities, BMS agreed to pay contingent consideration in the amount of $5.0 million to certain sellers. The conditions related to this contingency were met on November 30, 2018, and thus the notes had been issued to the sellers. These subordinated promissory notes had a maturity date of May 30, 2023, and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes continued to accrue until such time as these notes were paid or restructured.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these promissory notes was approximately $12.2 million. Related interest expense was approximately $0 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company paid approximately $3.5 million on these notes. In addition to the paydown, the noteholders agreed to forgive the remaining accrued but unpaid interest of approximately $3.8 million and entered into new promissory notes in the principal amount of approximately $5.3 million in the aggregate. The terms of these new promissory notes provide for maturity on May 15, 2027 and carries an interest rate of Prime plus 1.00%, but no less than 7.50% per annum. Related interest expense was approximately $0.3 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n8.| DUE TO MEMBERS  \n---|---  \n  \nBMS had entered into promissory notes with certain of its members to provide for working capital. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these notes were approximately $5.2 million. The notes carried an interest at the rate of 10% and were due on demand.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the noteholders agreed to satisfy all outstanding obligations, including the payment of principal and interest, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to approximately $0.9 million, forgiveness of certain other obligations owed to a noteholder and the issuance of 357,000 shares of Common Stock of Binah Capital Group, Inc.\n\n​\n\n9.| SERIES A REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  \n---|---  \n  \nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Funding Date”), in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Holdings and BMS entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\nAdditionally, the Holdings Series A Stock carries a cumulative dividend at a rate of nine percent (9%) per annum, payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each quarter. At the discretion of Holdings, the payment may be made in cash or up to 50% of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Holdings Series A Stock at a value of $10 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company paid an in-kind dividend in the amount $0.4 million.\n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n9.| SERIES A REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Holdings Series A Stock has liquidation preferences in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation as follows:\n\n●| The greater of $12.50 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $13.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the second anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $15.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $16.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date.  \n---|---  \n  \nHoldings, at its option, may redeem the Series A Stock on any anniversary of the Funding date up to an including the fourth anniversary of the Funding date at the following redemption prices:\n\n●| $11.50 per share of Series A Stock on the first anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $13.00 per share of Series A Stock on the second anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $15.00 per share of Series A Stock on the third anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $16.00 per share of Series A Stock on the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the Series A Stock have not previously been redeemed or converted, the Series A Stock will be redeemed by Holdings on the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date.\n\n​\n\n**10.**| **SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK**  \n---|---  \n  \nOn September 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with certain investors for the purchase of 150,000 shares of Holdings’ Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 (the “Holdings Series B Stock”) in a private placement at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000). The Holdings Series B Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock, at the option of the investor at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) $10.00 divided, by (ii) the product of (A) .80 multiplied by, (B) the volume weighted average price for the 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such conversion, provided that in no event shall the denominator be less than $6.00 per share (the “Conversion Rate”).\n\nAdditionally, the Holdings Series B Stock carries a cumulative dividend at a rate of nine percent (7%) per annum, payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each quarter. At the discretion of Holdings, the payment may be made in cash or up to 50% of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Holdings Series B Stock at a value of $10 per share.\n\nThe Company may, at its option, in whole, or part, redeem the Holdings Series B Stock any time after the first anniversary of the date of the Subscription Agreement at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) $12.00 per share of Holdings Series B Stock, plus accrued but unpaid dividends or (A) 1.20 multiplied by (B) the volume weighted average price for 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to the redemption; provided that such price shall not greater than $20.00.\n\n​\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n11.| WARRANTS  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table summarizes the warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024:\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \n**Class of Warrants**| **Number Outstanding**  \nPublic warrants|  8,588,425  \nPrivate placement warrants|  6,559,533  \nTotal warrants outstanding|  15,147,958  \n  \n​\n\nEach whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per share if the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period. The Private Warrants cannot be redeemed, even if sold or transferred to a non-affiliate. The Warrants will expire five years after the Closing Date or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nExcept as described in this section, the Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, except the Private Warrants are not subject to redemption, and do not become subject to redemption after transfer to a non-affiliate (a distinction from other private placement warrants issued in connection with SPAC transactions).\n\nThe Warrants are classified as derivative liabilities under ASC Topic 480 or ASC Topic 815. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrant liabilities is approximately $0.5 million and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\n​\n\n**12.**| **INCOME TAXES**  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, Binah Capital Group, Inc. is the parent company of KWAC, which is the parent company of BMS. KWAC is a corporation and subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local taxes. BMS is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nKWAC, the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG are taxable entities and are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only.\n\nThe effective tax rate was approximately (46)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective income tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2024 differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily due to transaction costs that were incurred as a result of the Reverse Recapitalization. The tax provision is related to the activities of the taxable entities including the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal and state jurisdictions. The Company is generally not subject to examinations for its federal and state returns for any periods prior to the 2019 tax year. The Company is not currently under examination for any tax years.\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n13.| NET LOSS PER SHARE  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Series A and Series B Preferred Stock does not have similar economic rights to the common stock and management does not consider them to be in substance common shares for earnings per share (“EPS”) purposes. As a result, the weighted average Series A and Series B Preferred Stock outstanding during the period was not included in the calculation of weighted average common stock outstanding. The Public and Private Warrants were considered in diluted EPS under the treasury stock method, if dilutive.\n\nManagement determined that EPS was not presented for periods prior to the Merger as it was not considered to be meaningful.\n\nThe computation of loss per share and weighted average of the Company’s common stock outstanding for the period from the date of transaction close through September 30, 2024 is as follows _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months**|  ​| **Nine Months**  \n​| ​| **ended September 30,**|  ​| **Ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2024**  \nNet (loss)| $|  (1,150)| ​|  (4,197)  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, common stock| ​|  16,602| ​|  16,588  \nBasic and diluted loss per share of common stock| ​| $|  (0.07)| ​|  (0.25)  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table details the securities that have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share for the period presented as they were anti-dilutive _(in thousands)_.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \nWarrants| ​|  15,148  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n14.| COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  \n---|---  \n  \nLitigation\n\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\n\nThere can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe Company is a defendant or respondent in various pending and threatened arbitrations, administrative proceedings and lawsuits seeking compensatory damages. Claim amounts are infrequently indicative of the actual amounts the Company will be liable for, if any. Many of these claimants also seek, in addition to compensatory damages, punitive or treble damages, and all seek interest, costs and fees. These matters arise in the normal course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nIn many lawsuits, arbitrations, and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect management’s estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter.\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, management cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. The Company believes, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, dispute, or investigation will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the actual outcomes of such legal proceedings, claims, disputes, or investigations could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period as additional information is obtained.\n\nIndemnification\n\nThe activities of the Company’s customers are transacted on either a cash or margin basis through the facilities of its clearing broker. In margin transactions, the clearing broker extends credit to the customers, subject to various regulatory and margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the customer’s account. In connection with these activities, the clearing broker may also execute and clear customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased.\n\nThese transactions may expose the Company to significant off-balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses which the customers may incur. In the event the customers fail to satisfy their obligations to the clearing broker, the Company may be required to compensate the clearing broker for losses incurred on behalf of the customers.\n\nThe Company, through its clearing broker, seeks to control the risk associated with its customers’ activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, management of the Company had not been notified by any clearing brokers, nor were they otherwise aware of any potential losses relating to this indemnification.\n\n​\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n15.| COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company is authorized to issue 57,500,000 shares consisting of the following:\n\n●| 2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 1,536,400 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024; and  \n---|---  \n●| 500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 150,000 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024; and  \n---|---  \n●| 55,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 16,602,460 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024.  \n---|---  \n**16.**| **NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company operates four registered broker-dealers that are subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1). This requires the Company to maintain certain minimum net capital requirements. As of and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all broker-dealers had net capital in excess of the required minimums.\n\n17.| CREDIT RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS  \n---|---  \n  \nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The Company performs certain credit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its counterparties and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its counterparties, establishes an allowance for credit losses and, consequently, believes that its receivables credit risk exposure beyond such allowances is limited.\n\n18.| SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company evaluated subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date up to November 14, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nItem 2.

References to the “Company,” “us” or “we” refer to Binah Capital Group, Inc._\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\n _This Quarterly Report on Form10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings._\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nBinah Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company), is a leading consolidator of retail wealth management businesses that owns and operates ten entities, four of which are broker-dealers, three of which are registered investment advisors, and three of which are insurance entities, that have over 1900 registered individuals working within the financial services industries.\n\nThe Company focuses on three critical areas comprised of the hybrid, independent and W2 business models to allow affiliated advisors to choose the operating model that works best for them and run their practices on their own terms. The Company’s platform adds to its flexibility by providing a variety of custody and clearing firm options to accommodate the unique business needs of advisors.\n\nThe Merger\n\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), Binah Capital consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 7, 2022 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement” and the consummation of such contemplated transactions, the “Closing”), by and among Kingswood Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (“KWAC”), Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Kingswood Merger Sub”), Wentworth Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth Merger Sub”), and Wentworth Management Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (dba, Binah Management Services, “BMS”). Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transaction set forth in the Merger Agreement. Binah Capital was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of KWAC and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Binah Capital. On the Closing Date, Kingswood Merger Sub merged with and into KWAC, with KWAC continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital and Wentworth Merger Sub merged with and into BMS, with BMS continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital. Following the BMS merger, KWAC acquired, and Binah Capital contributed to KWAC all of the common units of BMS directly held by Binah Capital after the Wentworth merger, such that, following the Binah Capital contribution, BMS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KWAC.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, (i) the holders of shares of KWAC’s common stock (“KWAC Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (other than any redeemed shares) received one share of common stock of Holdings (“Holdings Common Stock”) in exchange for each share of KWAC Common Stock held by them, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, (ii) 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock issued to Sponsor was placed by Holdings into an escrow account and will not be released to the Sponsor unless the dollar volume-weighted average price of Holdings Common Stock exceeds $12.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the four-year period following the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) the holders of each whole warrant to purchase KWAC Class A Common Stock received one warrant to purchase Holdings Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, (iv) 12 million shares of Holdings Common Stock, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, was issued to the equity holders of BMS in proportion to their ownership interests in BMS, (v) an additional 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock was issued to certain equity holders of BMS, (vi) 3,084,450 KWAC Private Placement Warrants held by Sponsor were forfeited immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination, and (vii) 3,084,450 warrants to purchase Holding Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share were issued to the equity holders of BMS in proportion to their ownership interests in BMS. As a result of the Business Combination, BMS became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, Holdings entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\nOur Sources of Revenue\n\nOur revenue is derived primarily from fees and commissions from products and advisory services offered by our advisors to their clients, a substantial portion of which we pay out to our advisors.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nResults for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included a net loss of approximately $(1.2) million and $(3.5) million and total revenue of approximately $42.2 million and $124.3 million, respectively, which compares to net income and total revenue of $0.2 million and $ 1.4 million and approximately $42.9 million and $126.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2023.\n\nAsset Trends\n\nTotal advisory and brokerage assets served were $26.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $22.8 billion at September 30, 2023.

Our key metrics of Gross Profit and EBITDA are “non-GAAP financial measures.” Our management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined under the rules of the SEC, to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Gross Profit and EBITDA provide investors and analysts useful insight into our financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nGross profit is defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue. We consider our gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight into our core operating performance before other costs that are general and administrative in nature.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\n​\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appears below in the footnotes to the table of our key operating, business and financial metrics.\n\nOur key operating, business and financial metrics are as follows:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **As of and for the Three Months Ended September 30,**  \nOperating Metric (dollars in billions)| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| ​  \nBrokerage assets| ​| $|  24.5| ​| $|  20.8  \nAdvisory assets| ​|  2.5| ​|  2.0  \n**Total Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| $|  26.9| ​| $|  22.8  \n**Net New Assets**|  ​| ​  \nNet new brokerage assets| ​| $|  0.4| ​| $|  0.5  \nNet new advisory assets| ​|  0.0| ​|  0.0  \nTotal Net New Assets| ​| $|  0.4| ​| $|  0.5  \nFinancial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​| $|  42.2| ​| $|  42.9  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  (1.2)| ​| $|  0.2  \nNon-GAAP Financial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nGross Profit(1)| ​| $|  8.4| ​| $|  7.0  \nEBITDA(2)| ​| $|  0.4| ​| $|  1.6  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **As of and for the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \nOperating Metric (dollars in billions)| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBrokerage assets| $|  24.5| $|  20.8  \nAdvisory assets| ​| ​|  2.5| ​| ​|  2.0  \n**Total Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| $|  26.9| ​| $|  22.8  \n**Net New Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet new brokerage assets| ​| $|  (1.7)| ​| $|  (2.7)  \nNet new advisory assets| ​| ​|  (0.1)| ​| ​|  (0.5)  \nTotal Net New Assets| ​| $|  (1.8)| ​| $|  (3.2)  \nFinancial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​| $|  124.3| ​| $|  126.7  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  (3.5)| ​| $|  1.4  \nNon-GAAP Financial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nGross Profit(1)| ​| $|  23.5| ​| $|  22.8  \nEBITDA(2)| ​| $|  0.9| ​| $|  6.5  \n(1)| Gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue.

The U.S. economy added roughly 558,000 jobs in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate averaged 4.1% in the third quarter of 2024, consistent with the average in the prior quarter.\n\nOur business is also sensitive to current and expected short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by Fed policy. During the third quarter of 2024, Fed policymakers lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.8% to 5.0%. The equity markets surged to new highs resulting in the S&P 500 returning 5.9% during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Please consult the Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including those described in the section titled “** Risk Factors**.”**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Currently, we conduct business through one operating segment. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.

We also generate interest income in accordance with our agreements with our clearing partners. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we record revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are recognized on the trade date or the transaction date, which represents the completion of the Company’s performance obligation because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer at a point in time. The rates at which commissions are charged to the customers range from 1% to 7% based on the investment product. Trailing commission revenues which are preliminarily related to the sales of mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of the Company’s advisors are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally based on a fixed rate applied, generally twenty-five to fifty basis points (25-50 bps) of the current market value of the clients’ holdings. Trailing commissions are generally received monthly or quarterly. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and the client’s investment hold period and the Company does not believe that it can overcome such constraints until the market value of the fund and the investor activities are known. The revenues will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\nThe Company is principal for the commission revenue, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing it obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenue is reported on a gross basis. See Note 4 - Revenues From Contracts with Customers within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 for further details regarding our commission revenue by product category.\n\nThe following tables sets forth the components of our commission revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the three months ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​| **% Change**  \nSales-based| ​| $|  16,441| ​| $|  18,939| $|  (2,498)| -13.2| %  \nTrailing| ​|  18,339| ​|  16,530| $|  1,807| 10.9| %  \nTotal commission revenue| ​| $|  34,780| ​| $|  35,469| $|  (691)| -1.9| %  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the nine months ended September 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**| **% Change**|  ​  \nSales-based| ​| $|  48,058| ​| $|  56,184|  (8,126)| -14.5| %  \nTrailing| ​|  54,778| ​|  47,928|  6,850| 14.3| %  \nTotal commission revenue| ​| $|  102,836| ​| $|  104,112|  (1,276)| -1.2| %  \n  \n​\n\nSales-based revenue decreased by approximately $2.5 and $8.1 million or 13.2% and 14.5% for the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023. Trailing based revenue increased by approximately $1.8 and $6.8 million or 10.9% and 14.3% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023. The decrease in sales-based revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is attributable to a decrease in the generation of transactional based products. The increase in the trailing based revenues is primarily due to the positive market performance related to the trail-eligible assets.\n\nCommission revenue is generated from brokerage assets.

The Company provides ongoing investment advice, brokerage and execution services on transactions, and performs administrative services for these accounts. These fees are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory fees generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts.\n\nAdvisory fees increased by approximately 14.7% and 11.7% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in September 30, 2023, due to positive returns in the market offset by outflows of advisory assets.\n\nThe following tables summarizes the advisory assets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in billions):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**  \nAdvisory Assets| ​| $|  2.5| ​| $|  2.0  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes activity impacting advisory assets for the periods ended (in billions):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**  \nBalance - Beginning of period| $|  2.3| ​| $|  2.0  \nNet new advisory assets(1)| ​|  0.0| ​| ​|  0.1  \nMarket impact(2)| ​|  0.1| ​| ​|  (0.1)  \nBalance - End of period| $|  2.5| ​| $|  2.0  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**  \nBalance - Beginning of period| $|  2.1| ​| $|  2.1  \nNet new advisory assets(1)| ​|  (0.0)| ​| ​|  (0.5)  \nMarket impact(2)| ​|  0.4| ​| ​|  0.4  \nBalance - End of period| $|  2.5| ​| $|  2.0  \n(1)| Net new advisory assets consist of total client deposits less client withdrawals from custodial accounts, plus dividends, plus interest, minus advisory fees.  \n---|---  \n  \n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n(2)| Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balances less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market change over the same period of time.  \n---|---  \n  \nInterest and other income\n\nInterest income includes amounts earned on balances held at the Company’s clearing brokers related to cash balances and margin balances. The Company’s clearing agreements include provisions that provide for a sharing of the interest income earned on such balances with the clearing brokers. The rate varies based on the clearing broker.\n\nOther income primarily includes amounts earned by the Company related to marketing and incentives earned from the sales of certain investment products by the financial advisors to its clients, primarily alternative investments, as well as sponsorship income.\n\nThe decrease in interest and other income for the period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023 is primarily related to a non-recurring income item that was earned in March 2023.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nCommissions and Fees\n\nCommissions and fees primarily consist of commissions paid to the financial advisors, technology costs associated with the platform for which the financial advisors operate their business, insurance costs and regulatory costs. Certain of the technology, insurance and regulatory costs are passed through to the financial advisors and any excess costs are included as fees within commissions and fees. The commissions and fees paid to the financial advisors are based on the advisory and commission revenue earned on each client’s account.

Although these estimates are based on the \n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCompany’s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe define our critical accounting policies and estimates as those that require us to make subjective judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Management exercises judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenue on a net basis). For additional information see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units.\n\nWe performed our goodwill impairment test as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The estimated fair value of the reporting units were determined using the market approach for each reporting unit, relying specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. As a result of the 2023 and 2022 annual impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting units was 257% and 266% greater than its carrying value, respectively. Since there have been no events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting units were below their carrying amount, interim goodwill tests were not considered necessary.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, economic trends and market conditions, changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies, unanticipated competition, discount rates, technology, or government regulations. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider other information, such as public market comparable and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments, and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.\n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note 2 -  _Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,_ within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, to us.\n\n​\n\nItem 3.

Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a stated value equal to $10.00 per share, subject to increase set forth in section 3 below (the “ _Stated Value_ ”)\n\nSection 2. _Ranking_.\n\nEach share of Preferred Stock shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the provisions herein. The Preferred Stock shall, with respect to payment of dividends, redemption payments, and rights (including as to the distribution of assets) upon Liquidation, rank senior and prior to the Corporation’s Junior Stock. The Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all of the Corporation’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, indebtedness and other liabilities.\n\nSection 3. _Dividends_.\n\n(a) Subject to the prior and superior right of the Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall pay, cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the Stated Value per share) of seven percent (7%) per annum**,** payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter, beginning on the first such date after the Funding Date, on each Conversion Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being converted) and on each Redemption Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being redeemed) (each such date, a “ _Dividend Payment Date_ ”) (if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day) in cash, or at the Corporation’s option, up to 50% of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Preferred Stock (“ _Dividend Shares_ ”) or a combination thereof. For purposes hereof, each Dividend Share shall be deemed to have a value of $10.00 per share. The Holders shall have the same rights and remedies with respect to the delivery of any such shares as if such shares were being issued pursuant to Section 8.\n\n​\n\n(b) Dividends shall cease to accrue with respect to any Preferred Stock converted, provided that the Corporation actually delivers the Conversion Shares within the time period required by Section 6(c)(i) herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays dividends partially in cash and partially in shares, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among the Holders based upon the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by each Holder on such Dividend Payment Date.\n\n(c) So long as any Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary thereof shall directly or indirectly pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution upon, nor shall any distribution be made in respect of, any Junior Stock, nor shall any monies be set aside for or applied to the purchase or redemption (through a sinking fund or otherwise) of any Junior Stock.\n\nSection 4. _Liquidation Preference_.\n\n(a) In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (a “ _Liquidation_ ”), after payment or provision for payment of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Preferred Stock held before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any Junior Stock, $10.00 per share of Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Preferred Stock through the date of Liquidation (collectively, the “ _Liquidation Preference_ ”) and (ii) second, after the full Liquidation Preference has been paid or set aside the remaining amount shall be distributed _pro rata_ and on a _pari passu_ basis to holders of Common Stock and the Holders as if each such share of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof immediately prior to such Liquidation.\n\n(b) If in any Liquidation the assets available for payment of the Liquidation Preference are insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts described in _Section 4(a)(i)_ to the holders of the Preferred Stock then all the remaining available assets shall be distributed _pro rata_ among the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preferences.\n\n(c) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by the incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed or transferred, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a Liquidation; _provided_ that, in each case, effective provision is made in the certificate of incorporation of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the preservation and protection of the rights of the Holders on substantially identical terms.\n\nSection 5. _Voting Rights_.\n\n(a) _In General_. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly set forth in this _Section 5_ , the Holders will vote together with the Common Stock and not as a separate class, except as required by law, on any matters on which any of the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.\n\n(b) _Authorization of Senior Preferred Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 5(a)_ and for so long as any shares of Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding, without the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall not and shall not permit an Subsidiary to authorize or issue Senior Preferred Shares.\n\n(c) _Amendment or Alteration of Terms of Preferred Stock_ Notwithstanding _Section 5(a)_ , the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single\n\n​\n\nclass separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, shall be required for the approval of any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of this Certificate of Designations (including by merger, operation of Law or otherwise) which adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein contained shall require such vote or approval (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or any authorization, designation or increase of any class or series of shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or (ii) in connection with any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction in which the Corporation is the surviving entity which does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock.\n\n(d) _One Vote Per Share._ On any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote pursuant to this _Section 5_ , each Holder will have one (1) vote per share.\n\nSection 6. _Redemption._\n\n(a)The Corporation may, at its option, in whole or in part, redeem the Preferred Stock, anytime after the first anniversary of the Funding Date (the “ _Redemption Date_ ”), by delivery of written notice to each Holder at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) $12.00 per share of Preferred Stock, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, or (ii) the product of (A) 1.20 multiplied by (B) the volume weighted average price for 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such redemption; provided that such price shall not be greater than $20.00.\n\n(b)Notice of the redemption of Preferred Stock under this Section 7 shall be delivered by e-mail to each holder of record of Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as shown on the Corporation’s records, at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date. Neither the failure to e-mail any notice required by this Section 6(b), nor any defect therein or in the e-mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice which was e-mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date e-mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such e-mailed notice shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) if less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price set forth in Section 5(a); and (iv) the place or places at which certificates, if any, for such shares of Preferred Stock are to be surrendered (or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form, the depositary or other facilities of which such shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed). Notice having been e-mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available an amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (x) except as otherwise provided herein, dividends on shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, (y) said shares of Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (z) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall cease (except the right to receive cash payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary, and to receive any dividends payable thereon). The Corporation’s obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Corporation) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, funds necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two (2) years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds\n\n​\n\nof the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such Shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of such cash.\n\n(c)As promptly as practicable after the surrender or delivery in accordance with said notice of any such shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and if the notice shall so state, or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary), such shares of Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which such shares of Preferred Stock have been redeemed.\n\n(d)The deposit of funds with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:\n\n(i)| the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and  \n---|---  \n(ii)| any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price without interest or other earnings.  \n---|---  \n  \n(e)Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Corporation may not effect any redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6 while any shares of Series A Convertible Stock remain outstanding.\n\nSection 7. _Conversion_.\n\n(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and after the Funding Date and prior to their redemption, at the option of the Holder thereof, at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) $10.00, divided by (ii) the product of (A) .80 multiplied by, (B) the volume weighted average price for the 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such conversion, provided that in no event shall the denominator be less than $6.00 per share (the “ _Conversion Rate_ ”). Holders shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto as _Annex A_ (a “ _Notice of Conversion_ ”). Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by e-mail such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date, the “ _Conversion Date_ ”). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. Upon delivery of the Notice of Conversion by a Holder, such Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Conversion Shares with respect to which the Preferred Stock has been converted, irrespective of date of delivery of such Conversion Shares. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required. The calculations and entries set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. Shares of Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock or redeemed in accordance with the terms hereof shall be canceled and shall not be reissued. In addition, all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall mandatorily and automatically convert into shares of Common Stock in accordance with this Section 7 upon the affirmative\n\n​\n\nvote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock voting as a single class.\n\n(b) Mechanics of Conversion.\n\n(i) Not later than the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the “ _Share Delivery Date_ ”), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting Holder (A) the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock and (B) at the option of the holder (ii) the number of Dividend Shares or (ii) cash, in each case, in the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock subject to conversion. The Corporation shall deliver the Conversion Shares electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, “ _Standard Settlement Period_ ” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation’s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion, but in no event earlier than one (1) Trading Day after each Conversion Date. To the extent that the Conversion Shares are subject to an effective registration covering the issuance of such Conversion Shares to, or resale of such Conversion Shares by, the Holder, then such Conversion Shares shall be issued free and clear of any restrictive legends.\n\n(ii) If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion.\n\n(iii) The Corporation’s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder.\n\n(iv) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, each as provided herein, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and payment of dividends hereunder. The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.\n\n​\n\n(v) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Rate or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock.\n\n(vi) The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Corporation (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares.\n\n(c) If, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions is a party to any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed, (iv) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into, exchanged for or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or property, or any combination thereof (such other securities, cash or property, or combination thereof, the “ _Reference Property_ ,” and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such transaction, a “Reference Property Unit”) (each such transaction, a “ _Fundamental Transaction_ ”), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (I) at the effective time of such Fundamental Transaction, the Conversion Shares due upon conversion of any Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this Certificate of Designation were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units and (II) if such Reference Property Unit consists of any security of a Person other than the Corporation, then such Person (and, as a condition to the Corporation effecting such Fundamental Transaction, the Corporation shall ensure that such Person) shall execute such instruments as shall be necessary to give effect to this Section 7(c). If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in such Fundamental Transaction, then each Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Reference Property Unit it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders’ right to convert such preferred stock into Reference Property Units. The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the “ _Successor Entity_ ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of\n\n​\n\nthis Section 7(c) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holders, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Stock which is convertible in accordance with this Section 7(c), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holders. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and, except in the case of a lease, be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Corporation” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein.\n\nSection 8. _Adjustments; Rights of Holders Upon Certain Dividends, Distributions or Fundamental Transactions._\n\n(a) If the Corporation, at any time while any Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares or (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to equal an amount equal to such Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before giving effect to such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such event as applicable.\n\n(b) In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the “ _Purchase Rights_ ”), then, without duplication of any dividends to be due on Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3(a), each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon conversion of such Holder’s Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof) on the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.\n\n(c) All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.

The failure of the Corporation or a Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Certificate of Designation on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party (or any other Holder) of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Certificate of Designation on any other occasion. Any waiver by the Corporation or a Holder must be in writing.\n\nSection 16. _Severability_.\n\nIf any provision of this Certificate of Designation is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Certificate of Designation shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances.

The right to specific enforcement shall include the right of the parties hereto to cause the other parties hereto to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Subscription Agreement.

In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or any other form of electronic delivery, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such signature page were an original thereof.\n\n**6.16** _Construction_.

Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a stated value equal to $10.00 per share, subject to increase set forth in section 3 below (the “ _Stated Value_ ”)\n\nSection 2. _Ranking_.\n\nEach share of Preferred Stock shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the provisions herein. The Preferred Stock shall, with respect to payment of dividends, redemption payments, and rights (including as to the distribution of assets) upon Liquidation, rank senior and prior to the Corporation’s Junior Stock. The Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all of the Corporation’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, indebtedness and other liabilities.\n\nSection 3. _Dividends_.\n\n(a) Subject to the prior and superior right of the Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall pay, cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the Stated Value per share) of seven percent (7%) per annum**,** payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter, beginning on the first such date after the Funding Date, on each Conversion Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being converted) and on each Redemption Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being redeemed) (each such date, a “ _Dividend Payment Date_ ”) (if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day) in cash, or at the Corporation’s option, up to 50% of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Preferred Stock (“ _Dividend Shares_ ”) or a combination thereof. For purposes hereof, each Dividend Share shall be deemed\n\n​\n\nto have a value of $10.00 per share. The Holders shall have the same rights and remedies with respect to the delivery of any such shares as if such shares were being issued pursuant to Section 8.\n\n(b) Dividends shall cease to accrue with respect to any Preferred Stock converted, provided that the Corporation actually delivers the Conversion Shares within the time period required by Section 6(c)(i) herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays dividends partially in cash and partially in shares, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among the Holders based upon the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by each Holder on such Dividend Payment Date.\n\n(c) So long as any Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary thereof shall directly or indirectly pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution upon, nor shall any distribution be made in respect of, any Junior Stock, nor shall any monies be set aside for or applied to the purchase or redemption (through a sinking fund or otherwise) of any Junior Stock.\n\nSection 4. _Liquidation Preference_.\n\n(a) In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation (a “ _Liquidation_ ”), after payment or provision for payment of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Preferred Stock held before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any Junior Stock, $10.00 per share of Preferred Stock plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Preferred Stock through the date of Liquidation (collectively, the “ _Liquidation Preference_ ”) and (ii) second, after the full Liquidation Preference has been paid or set aside the remaining amount shall be distributed _pro rata_ and on a _pari passu_ basis to holders of Common Stock and the Holders as if each such share of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof immediately prior to such Liquidation.\n\n(b) If in any Liquidation the assets available for payment of the Liquidation Preference are insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts described in _Section 4(a)(i)_ to the holders of the Preferred Stock then all the remaining available assets shall be distributed _pro rata_ among the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preferences.\n\n(c) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by the incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed or transferred, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a Liquidation; _provided_ that, in each case, effective provision is made in the certificate of incorporation of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the preservation and protection of the rights of the Holders on substantially identical terms.\n\nSection 5. _Voting Rights_.\n\n(a) _In General_. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly set forth in this _Section 5_ , the Holders will vote together with the Common Stock and not as a separate class, except as required by law, on any matters on which any of the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote.\n\n(b) _Authorization of Senior Preferred Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 5(a)_ and for so long as any shares of Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding, without the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall not and shall not permit an Subsidiary to authorize or issue Senior Preferred Shares.\n\n​\n\n(c) _Amendment or Alteration of Terms of Preferred Stock_ Notwithstanding _Section 5(a)_ , the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, shall be required for the approval of any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of this Certificate of Designations (including by merger, operation of Law or otherwise) which adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein contained shall require such vote or approval (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or any authorization, designation or increase of any class or series of shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or (ii) in connection with any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction in which the Corporation is the surviving entity which does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock.\n\n(d) _One Vote Per Share._ On any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote pursuant to this _Section 5_ , each Holder will have one (1) vote per share.\n\nSection 6. _Redemption._\n\n(a)The Corporation may, at its option, in whole or in part, redeem the Preferred Stock, anytime after the first anniversary of the Funding Date (the “ _Redemption Date_ ”), by delivery of written notice to each Holder at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) $12.00 per share of Preferred Stock, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, or (ii) the product of (A) 1.20 multiplied by (B) the volume weighted average price for 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such redemption; provided that such price shall not be greater than $20.00.\n\n(b)Notice of the redemption of Preferred Stock under this Section 7 shall be delivered by e-mail to each holder of record of Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as shown on the Corporation’s records, at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date. Neither the failure to e-mail any notice required by this Section 6(b), nor any defect therein or in the e-mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice which was e-mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date e-mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such e-mailed notice shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) if less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price set forth in Section 5(a); and (iv) the place or places at which certificates, if any, for such shares of Preferred Stock are to be surrendered (or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form, the depositary or other facilities of which such shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed). Notice having been e-mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available an amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (x) except as otherwise provided herein, dividends on shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, (y) said shares of Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (z) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall cease (except the right to receive cash payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary, and to receive any dividends payable thereon). The Corporation’s obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Corporation) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, funds necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption. No\n\n​\n\ninterest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two (2) years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such Shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of such cash.\n\n(c)As promptly as practicable after the surrender or delivery in accordance with said notice of any such shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and if the notice shall so state, or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary), such shares of Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which such shares of Preferred Stock have been redeemed.\n\n(d)The deposit of funds with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:\n\n(i)| the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and  \n---|---  \n(ii)| any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price without interest or other earnings.  \n---|---  \n  \n(e)Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Corporation may not effect any redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6 while any shares of Series A Convertible Stock remain outstanding.\n\nSection 7. _Conversion_.\n\n(a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and after the Funding Date and prior to their redemption, at the option of the Holder thereof, at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) $10.00, divided by (ii) the product of (A) .80 multiplied by, (B) the volume weighted average price for the 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such conversion, provided that in no event shall the denominator be less than $6.00 per share (the “ _Conversion Rate_ ”). Holders shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto as _Annex A_ (a “ _Notice of Conversion_ ”). Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by e-mail such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date, the “ _Conversion Date_ ”). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. Upon delivery of the Notice of Conversion by a Holder, such Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Conversion Shares with respect to which the Preferred Stock has been converted, irrespective of date of delivery of such Conversion Shares. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required. The calculations and entries set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. Shares of Preferred\n\n​\n\nStock converted into Common Stock or redeemed in accordance with the terms hereof shall be canceled and shall not be reissued. In addition, all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall mandatorily and automatically convert into shares of Common Stock in accordance with this Section 7 upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock voting as a single class.\n\n(b) Mechanics of Conversion.\n\n(i) Not later than the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the “ _Share Delivery Date_ ”), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting Holder (A) the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock and (B) at the option of the holder (ii) the number of Dividend Shares or (ii) cash, in each case, in the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock subject to conversion. The Corporation shall deliver the Conversion Shares electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, “ _Standard Settlement Period_ ” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation’s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion, but in no event earlier than one (1) Trading Day after each Conversion Date. To the extent that the Conversion Shares are subject to an effective registration covering the issuance of such Conversion Shares to, or resale of such Conversion Shares by, the Holder, then such Conversion Shares shall be issued free and clear of any restrictive legends.\n\n(ii) If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion.\n\n(iii) The Corporation’s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder.\n\n(iv) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, each as provided herein, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and payment of dividends hereunder.\n\n​\n\nThe Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.\n\n(v) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Rate or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock.\n\n(vi) The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Corporation (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares.\n\n(c) If, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions is a party to any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed, (iv) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into, exchanged for or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or property, or any combination thereof (such other securities, cash or property, or combination thereof, the “ _Reference Property_ ,” and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such transaction, a “Reference Property Unit”) (each such transaction, a “ _Fundamental Transaction_ ”), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (I) at the effective time of such Fundamental Transaction, the Conversion Shares due upon conversion of any Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this Certificate of Designation were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units and (II) if such Reference Property Unit consists of any security of a Person other than the Corporation, then such Person (and, as a condition to the Corporation effecting such Fundamental Transaction, the Corporation shall ensure that such Person) shall execute such instruments as shall be necessary to give effect to this Section 7(c). If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in such Fundamental Transaction, then each Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Reference Property Unit it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders’ right to convert such preferred\n\n​\n\nstock into Reference Property Units. The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the “ _Successor Entity_ ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(c) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holders, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Stock which is convertible in accordance with this Section 7(c), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holders. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and, except in the case of a lease, be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Corporation” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein.\n\nSection 8. _Adjustments; Rights of Holders Upon Certain Dividends, Distributions or Fundamental Transactions._\n\n(a) If the Corporation, at any time while any Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares or (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to equal an amount equal to such Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before giving effect to such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such event as applicable.\n\n(b) In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the “ _Purchase Rights_ ”), then, without duplication of any dividends to be due on Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3(a), each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon conversion of such Holder’s Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof) on the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.\n\n(c) All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 8, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding.\n\n(d) Notice to Holders.\n\n(i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 8, the Corporation shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.\n\n​\n\n(ii) If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered to each Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice.\n\nSection 9. _Repurchased or Reacquired Shares_.\n\nShares of Preferred Stock that have been repurchased or reacquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized, unissued and undesignated shares that shall be available for future issuance.\n\nSection 10. _Record Holders_.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Corporation and the Corporation’s transfer agent for the Preferred Stock may deem and treat the Holder of any share of Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.\n\nSection 11. _Notices_.\n\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided hereunder, all notices and other communications referred to herein shall be in writing and delivered personally or sent by e-mail or by reputable overnight courier service, charges prepaid:\n\n(a) If to the Corporation as follows, or as otherwise specified in a written notice given to each of the Holders in accordance with this _Section 11_ :\n\nBinah Capital Group, Inc.\n\n17 Battery Place, Room 625\n\nNew York, NY 10004\n\nAttention: Michael Nessim\n\n​\n\nE-mail: mnessim@kingswoodus.com\n\n(b) If to any Holder, by e-mail if such Holder has provided an e-mail address to the Corporation or its transfer agent for purposes of notification, or, if no such e-mail address is available, to such Holder’s address as it appears in the stock records of the Corporation or as otherwise specified in a written notice given by such Holder to the Corporation or, at the Corporation’s option with respect to any notice from the Corporation to a Holder, in accordance with customary practices of the Corporation’s transfer agent.

The failure of the Corporation or a Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Certificate of Designation on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party (or any other Holder) of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Certificate of Designation on any other occasion. Any waiver by the Corporation or a Holder must be in writing.\n\nSection 16. _Severability_.\n\nIf any provision of this Certificate of Designation is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Certificate of Designation shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law.\n\n​\n\nSection 17. _Next Business Day_.\n\nWhenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.\n\nSection 18. _Headings_.\n\nThe headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Certificate of Designation and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.\n\nSection 19. _Status of Converted or Redeemed Preferred Stock_.\n\nShares of Preferred Stock may only be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

(“MSI”) maintains offices in Albany, New York and includes the following entities:  \n---|---  \no| MSI, (d/b/a as Broadstone Securities, Inc., “Broadstone”), incorporated in the State of Michigan, is a financial services firm, and is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and is a member of FINRA.  \n---|---  \no| Michigan Advisors, Inc., (“MAI”) incorporated in the State of Michigan, was a SEC registered investment advisor. MAI withdrew its registration in September 2021.  \n---|---  \no| Insurance Audit Agency, Inc. (“IAA”), incorporated in the state of Michigan, is an insurance agency.  \n---|---  \n●| World Equity Group, Inc. (“WEG”), incorporated in the State of Illinois, is registered as a broker-dealer and investment advisor with the SEC and is a member of FINRA and SIPC. WEG maintains offices in Schaumburg, Illinois and has branch offices throughout the United States of America.  \n---|---  \n  \nBasis of Presentation\n\nReverse Recapitalization\n\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), Binah Capital consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 7, 2022 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement” and the consummation of such contemplated transactions, the “Closing”), by and among Kingswood Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (“KWAC”), Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Kingswood Merger Sub”), Wentworth Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth Merger Sub”), and Wentworth Management Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth”). Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transaction set forth in the Merger Agreement. Binah Capital was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of KWAC and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Binah Capital. On the Closing Date, Kingswood Merger Sub merged with and into KWAC, with KWAC continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital and Wentworth Merger Sub merged with and into Wentworth, with Wentworth continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital. Following the Wentworth merger, KWAC acquired, and Binah Capital contributed to KWAC all of the common units of Wentworth directly held by Binah Capital after the Wentworth merger, such that, following the Binah Capital contribution, Wentworth became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KWAC.\n\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Merger pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, KWAC is expected to be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the consolidated financial statements of Binah Capital will represent a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Wentworth with the business combination treated as the equivalent of the Wentworth issuing shares for the net assets of KWAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of KWAC will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the business combination will be those of Wentworth in future reports of Holdings (See Note 3 – Mergers and Recapitalization).\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“condensed consolidated financial statements”) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation and impairments of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses, contingencies, and other matters that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management, necessary to represent fairly the results of operations for the interim periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and the differences may be material to the condensed financial statements.\n\n​\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n1.| **DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**2.** SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation and impairments of intangible assets and deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses, and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. For additional information see Note 4 - _Revenues From Contracts with Customers._\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit and money market funds all of which have original maturities of three months or less.\n\nRestricted cash represents cash held by the Company’s lender related to its credit facility. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 restricted cash amounted to approximately $0.4 million.\n\nThe Company regularly maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company has not experienced any losses and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk from cash.\n\nReceivables\n\nReceivables, which amounted to approximately $10.3 million and $10.5 million as of January 1, 2024, and 2023, respectively, represent amounts due to the Company from its clearing brokers, clients, financial institutions and other. Receivables consists of unconditional amounts due and are reported at amortized costs. All receivables are uncollateralized.\n\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses _._ The Company accounts for estimated credit losses on financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326-20, _Financial Instruments-Credit Losses_. FASB ASC 326-20 requires the Company to estimate expected credit losses over the life of its financial assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures as of the reporting date based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company records the estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance for credit losses. For financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis the allowance for credit losses is reported as a valuation account on the statement of financial condition that adjusts the asset’s amortized cost basis. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are reported in credit loss expense, if applicable. Management believes its risk of loss on currently recorded receivables is minimal and accordingly an allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023 in the amount of $0.67 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\n\n​\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n2.| **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)  \n---|---  \n  \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. An impairment loss will be recognized if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, to the extent that it does not exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill. No impairment of goodwill was recognized for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\nThere was no impairment of intangible assets recognized for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFor the periods prior to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, Wentworth was treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and therefore not subject to federal taxes. Wentworth was subject to certain state and local income taxes. Additionally, KWAC was treated as a corporation and subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes.\n\nSubsequent to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, KWAC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, is the parent company of Wentworth, which is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, Wentworth is itself generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws, and any taxable income or loss is passed through and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including KWAC. KWAC is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to its distributive share of the items of the net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits of Wentworth. Additionally, Binah Capital Group, Inc., a corporation, is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes. \n\nKWAC, the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG are taxable entities subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company periodically evaluates deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce deferred tax assets, if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\n\n​\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**2.****SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)\n\n**Net Loss Per Share**\n\nBasic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of the Company’s preferred stock. Net income (loss) per share is not presented for periods prior to the Merger as such amounts would not be meaningful to users of the financial statements because the equity structure materially changed in connection with the Merger.\n\n**Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\n\nAs a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, the Company has issued and has outstanding warrants. The Company evaluates the warrants, to determine if such instruments should be considered stock-based compensation, pursuant to ASC Topic 718, and if not in the scope of ASC 718, if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480 and ASC Topic 815. The determination of whether the instrument should be classified as stock-based compensation or a derivative instrument, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\nWarrants issued to non-employees (the “Non-employee Warrants”) were not classified as stock-based compensation as there is no condition of employment such that the granting of the shares does not represent compensation. The Non-employee Warrants are classified as derivative liabilities under ASC Topic 480 or ASC Topic 815. Public Warrants to non-employees are measured at fair value on recurring basis, using the market approach based upon the quoted market price of Binah Capital Group, Inc.’s Public Warrants at the end of each reporting period. Private Placement Warrants issued to non-employees are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based upon the quoted price for similar liabilities (Public Warrants issued to non-employees) in active markets as of the end of each period.\n\n**Contingent Liabilities**\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. \n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable. \n\n**Emerging Growth Company Status**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and it thus may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**2.****SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**(continued)\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures relating to the rate reconciliation, disclosure of income taxes paid, and certain other disclosures. The ASU should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ to improve the disclosures about reportable segments and include more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. This ASU also requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment, like the Company, provide all of the disclosures required as part of the amendments and all existing disclosures required by Topic 280. The ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the related disclosures; however, it does not expect this update to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThere were no new accounting pronouncements during the three months ended June 30, 2024 that materially impacted the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n**3.** MERGER AND RECAPITALIZATION\n\nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, (i) the holders of shares of KWAC’s common stock (“KWAC Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (other than any redeemed shares) receivedone share of common stock of Holdings (“Holdings Common Stock”) in exchange for each share of KWAC Common Stock held by them, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, (ii) 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock issued to Sponsor was placed by Holdings into an escrow account and will not be released to the Sponsor unless the dollar volume-weighted average price of Holdings Common Stock exceeds $12.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the four-year period following the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) the holders of each whole warrant to purchase KWAC Class A Common Stock receivedone warrant to purchase Holdings Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, (iv) 12 million shares of Holdings Common Stock, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, was issued to the equity holders of Wentworth in proportion to their ownership interests in Wentworth, (v) an additional 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock was issued to certain equity holders of Wentworth, (vi) 3,084,450 KWAC Private Placement Warrants held by Sponsor were forfeited immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination, and (vii) 3,084,450 warrants to purchase Holding Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share were issued to the equity holders of Wentworth in proportion to their ownership interests in Wentworth. As a result of the Business Combination, Wentworth became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, Holdings entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**3.** MERGER AND RECAPITALIZATION (continued)\n\nHoldings applied to have the Holdings Common Stock and Holdings Warrants listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbols **BCG** and **BCG.W** , respectively. Prior to the mergers, the KWAC Class A Common Stock and KWAC Public Warrants were listed on the OTC Exchange under the symbols “KWAC” and “KWAC.WS,” respectively.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Holdings received approval for Holding’s securities to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Holdings common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and its warrants will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “BCG” and “BCG.W”, respectively.\n\n**4.** REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products. The Company views the selling, distribution and marketing, or any combination thereof, of investment products to such clients as a single performance obligation to the product sponsors.\n\nThe Company is the principal for commission revenues, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing its obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenues are reported on a gross basis.\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are based on a percentage of an investment product’s current market value at the time of purchase. Trailing commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the period during which services, such as ongoing support, are performed. As trailing commission revenues are based on the market value of clients’ investment holdings, the consideration is variable, and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts. The constraint is removed once the investment holdings value can be determined.\n\nAdvisory Fees\n\nAdvisory fees represent fees charged to advisors’ clients’ accounts on the Company’s corporate advisory platform. The Company provides ongoing investment advice, brokerage and execution services on transactions, and performs administrative services for these accounts. This series of performance obligations transfers control of the services to the client over time as the services are performed. These revenues are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory revenues generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts. As such, the consideration for these revenues is variable and an estimate of the variable consideration is constrained due to dependence on unpredictable market impacts on client portfolio values. The constraint is removed once the portfolio value can be determined.\n\nThe Company provides advisory services to clients on its corporate advisory platform through the advisor. The Company is the principal in these arrangements and recognizes advisory revenues on a gross basis, as the Company is responsible for satisfying the performance obligations and has control over determining the fees.\n\n​\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**4.** REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (continued)\n\nThe following table presents total revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by investment product for the periods ended June 30 _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Six Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| **June 30,**  \n**Revenue From Contracts With Customers**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  25,025| ​| $|  24,594| ​| $|  50,070| ​| $|  50,841  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  5,479| ​|  4,827| ​|  9,908| ​|  9,712  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  2,225| ​|  2,422| ​|  5,589| ​|  5,572  \nAlternative investments| ​|  935| ​|  1,481| ​|  2,491| ​|  2,519  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  6,320| ​|  5,259| ​|  12,004| ​|  10,886  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  39,983| ​| $|  38,582| ​| $|  80,061| ​| $|  79,529  \n  \n​\n\nThe following tables presents sales-based and trailing revenues disaggregated by product category for the periods ended June 30 _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Six Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| **June 30,**  \n**Sales-based (Point in time)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  11,592| ​| $|  16,439| ​| $|  21,030| ​| $|  26,410  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  1,107| ​|  1,647| ​|  2,525| ​|  2,784  \nSecurities commissions| ​|  2,225| ​|  2,422| ​|  5,589| ​|  5,572  \nAlternative investments| ​|  926| ​|  1,455| ​|  2,473| ​|  2,478  \n**Total Sales Based Revenues**|  ​| $|  15,850| ​| $|  21,964| ​| $|  31,617| ​| $|  37,245  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Six Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| **June 30,**  \n**Trailing (Over time)**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nVariable annuities and other insurance commissions| ​| $|  13,433| ​| $|  8,154| ​| $|  29,040| ​| $|  24,430  \nMutual fund commissions| ​|  4,372| ​|  3,178| ​|  7,383| ​|  6,927  \nAdvisory fees| ​|  6,320| ​|  5,259| ​|  12,004| ​|  10,886  \nAlternative investments| ​|  9| ​|  27| ​|  18| ​|  41  \n**Total Trailing Revenues**|  ​|  24,134| ​|  16,617| ​|  48,445| ​|  42,284  \n**Total Revenue From Contracts With Customers**|  ​| $|  39,983| ​| $|  38,582| ​| $|  80,061| ​| $|  79,529  \n  \n​\n\nContract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by the Company’s customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and there is an unconditional right to payment. The Company records a contract asset when the Company has recognized revenue prior to payment but the Company’s right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred revenues (a contract liability) until the performance obligations are satisfied. As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had receivables from contracts with customers totaling approximately $9.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The opening balance of receivables from contracts with customers was approximately $8.9 million and $8.6 million as of January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities from contracts with customers.\n\nInterest and Other Income\n\nThe Company earns interest income from client margin accounts and cash equivalents This revenue is not generated from contracts with customers. Additionally, the Company receives marketing fees and sponsorship income.\n\n​\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**5.** FAIR VALUE\n\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard establishes the following hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value:\n\n●| Level 1 - Inputs use quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 2 - Fair value measurements use other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable inputs, including inputs that are available in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the related asset or liability. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets and liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those assets and liabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \nCertain financial instruments are carried at cost on the statement of financial condition, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. The carrying value of debt approximates their fair value since the interest rates on these obligations represent current market rates.\n\n**6.** DEBT\n\nOn April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Oak Street Funding LLC (“Oak Street”) in the amount of $25 million. This note payable bears interest at the prime rate (“Prime”) (8.50% as of June 30, 2024) plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term and a 3-month interest only repayment provision. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of the Oak Street note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $16.7 million and $17.6 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 25, 2021, the Company entered into an additional promissory note with Oak Street in the amount of $4.1 million related to the acquisition of WEG (“WEG Note”). This note payable bears interest at Prime plus 2.25% and has a 10-year term. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of this note, net of unamortized debt issuance costs was $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively.\n\nUnder the Oak Street notes, the Company is subject to certain covenants as defined in the agreements. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial related covenants.\n\nThe minimum payments and maturities of the Oak Street notes as of June 30, 2024, are as follows _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| $|  1,220  \n2025| ​|  2,669  \n2026| ​|  2,993  \n2027| ​|  3,354  \n2028| ​|  3,757  \nThereafter| ​|  6,306  \nTotal| ​| $|  20,299  \n  \n​\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement with Oak Street providing for, among other things, consenting to the Business Combination, and the payoff and restructuring of certain debt obligations. Additionally, the rate of interest being charged will increase at rate of .15% per annum until the interest rate reaches a maximum of 15.00%, provided that in no event the interest rate will not be less than 10.75% (the “Floor”). Additionally, in connection with the amendment the Company has agreed to pay a fee equal to $0.14 million (the “Deferred Fee”), which is due and payable in the amounts of $0.025, which was paid on June 12, 2024 and $0.115, which is due and payable on August 12, 2024, respectively. If the obligations under this Credit Agreement are paid in full prior to August 12, 2024, the remaining deferred fee would be waived.\n\n​\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**6.** DEBT (continued)\n\nThe amended Credit Agreement also includes a guarantee provision whereby each of the Company, KWAC, Holdings and MHC Securities, LLC are guarantors under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, certain of the members of the Company provide guarantees under the Credit Agreement. \n\n​\n\n**7.** PROMISSORY NOTES – AFFILIATES\n\nOn November 30, 2017, Wentworth issued subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.6 million to certain sellers in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities. These notes had a maturity date of May 17, 2023 and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes continued to accrue until such time as these notes were paid or restructured.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with the acquisition of the PKSH Entities, Wentworth agreed to pay contingent consideration in the amount of $5.0 million to certain sellers. The conditions related to this contingency were met on November 30, 2018, and thus the notes had been issued to the sellers. These subordinated promissory notes had a maturity date of May 30, 2023, and accrued interest at a rate of 10% annually. The interest on these notes continued to accrue until such time as these notes were paid or restructured.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these promissory notes was approximately $12.2 million. Related interest expense was approximately $0 million and $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company paid approximately $3.5 million on these notes. In addition to the paydown, the noteholders agreed to forgive the remaining accrued but unpaid interest of approximately $3.8 million and entered into new promissory notes in the principal amount of approximately $5.3 million in the aggregate. The terms of these new promissory notes provide for maturity on May 15, 2027 and carries an interest rate of Prime plus 1.00%, but no less than 7.50% per annum. Related interest expense was approximately $0.1 and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**8.** DUE TO MEMBERS\n\nWentworth had entered into promissory notes with certain of its members to provide for working capital. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of principal and accrued interest related to these notes were approximately $5.2 million. The notes carried an interest at the rate of 10% and were due on demand.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the noteholders agreed to satisfy all outstanding obligations, including the payment of principal and interest, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to approximately $0.9 million, forgiveness of certain other obligations owed to a noteholder and the issuance of 357,000 shares of Common Stock of Binah Capital Group, Inc.\n\n​\n\n**9.** REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK\n\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Funding Date”), in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Holdings and Wentworth entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\nAdditionally, the Holdings Series A Stock carries a cumulative dividend at a rate of nine percent (9%) per annum, payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each quarter. At the discretion of Holdings, the payment may be made in cash or up to 50% of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Holdings Series A Stock at a value of $10 per share. As of June 30, 2024, the Company accrued 50% of the dividend to be paid in cash in the amount of $0.2 million and paid an in-kind dividend in the amount $0.2 million.\n\n​\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**9.** REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (continued)\n\nThe Holdings Series A Stock has liquidation preferences in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation as follows:\n\n●| The greater of $12.50 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $13.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the second anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $15.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $16.00 per share of Holdings Series A Stock if such liquidation occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date.  \n---|---  \n  \nHoldings, at its option, may redeem the Series A Stock on any anniversary of the Funding date up to an including the fourth anniversary of the Funding date at the following redemption prices:\n\n●| $11.50 per share of Series A Stock on the first anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $13.00 per share of Series A Stock on the second anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $15.00 per share of Series A Stock on the third anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n●| $16.00 per share of Series A Stock on the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date;  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the Series A Stock have not previously been redeemed or converted, the Series A Stock will be redeemed by Holdings on the fourth anniversary of the Funding Date.\n\n​\n\n**10.** WARRANTS\n\nThe following table summarizes the warrants outstanding as of June 30, 2024:\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \n**Class of Warrants**| **Number Outstanding**  \nPublic warrants|  8,588,425  \nPrivate placement warrants|  6,481,550  \nTotal warrants outstanding|  15,069,975  \n  \n​\n\nEach whole Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per share if the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period. The Private Warrants cannot be redeemed, even if sold or transferred to a non-affiliate. The Warrants will expire five years after the Closing Date or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nExcept as described in this section, the Private Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants, except the Private Warrants are not subject to redemption, and do not become subject to redemption after transfer to a non-affiliate (a distinction from other private placement warrants issued in connection with SPAC transactions).\n\nThe Warrants are classified as derivative liabilities under ASC Topic 480 or ASC Topic 815. At June 30, 2024, the fair value of the warrant liabilities is approximately $0.5 million and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\n​\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**11.****INCOME TAXES**\n\nAs a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, Binah Capital Group, Inc. is the parent company of KWAC, which is the parent company of Wentworth. KWAC is a corporation and subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local taxes. Wentworth is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nKWAC, the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG are taxable entities and are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements include an income tax provision for the taxable entities only.\n\nThe effective tax rate was approximately (15)% for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The effective income tax rate for the period ended June 30, 2024 differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily due to transaction costs that were incurred as a result of the Reverse Recapitalization. The tax provision is related to the activities of the taxable entities including the PKSH Entities, Cabot Entities and WEG.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal and state jurisdictions. The Company is generally not subject to examinations for its federal and state returns for any periods prior to the 2019 tax year. The Company is not currently under examination for any tax years.\n\n​\n\n**12.** NET LOSS PER SHARE\n\nThe Series A Preferred Stock does not have similar economic rights to the common stock and management does not consider them to be in substance common shares for earnings per share (“EPS”) purposes. As a result, the weighted average Series A Preferred Stock outstanding during the period was not included in the calculation of weighted average common stock outstanding. The Public and Private Warrants were considered in diluted EPS under the treasury stock method, if dilutive.\n\nManagement determined that EPS was not presented for periods prior to the Merger as it was not considered to be meaningful.\n\nThe computation of loss per share and weighted average of the Company’s common stock outstanding for the period from the date of transaction close through June 30, 2024 is as follows _(in thousands)_ :\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months**|  ​| **Six Months**  \n​| ​| **ended June 30,**|  ​| **Ended June 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2024**  \nNet (loss)| $|  (657)| ​|  (2,970)  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, common stock| ​|  16,573| ​|  16,573  \nBasic and diluted loss per share of common stock| ​| $|  (0.04)| ​|  (0.18)  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table details the securities that have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share for the period presented as they were anti-dilutive _(in thousands)_.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \nWarrants| ​|  15,070  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**13.** COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nLitigation\n\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\n\nThere can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\n\nThe Company is a defendant or respondent in various pending and threatened arbitrations, administrative proceedings and lawsuits seeking compensatory damages. Claim amounts are infrequently indicative of the actual amounts the Company will be liable for, if any. Many of these claimants also seek, in addition to compensatory damages, punitive or treble damages, and all seek interest, costs and fees. These matters arise in the normal course of business. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nIn many lawsuits, arbitrations, and regulatory proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. However, accruals are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect management’s estimates of the impact of developments, rulings, advice of counsel and any other information pertinent to a particular matter.\n\nBecause of the inherent difficulty in predicting the ultimate outcome of legal and regulatory actions, management cannot predict with certainty the eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters. The Company believes, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, dispute, or investigation will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the actual outcomes of such legal proceedings, claims, disputes, or investigations could be material to the Company’s operating results and cash flows for a particular future period as additional information is obtained.\n\nIndemnification\n\nThe activities of the Company’s customers are transacted on either a cash or margin basis through the facilities of its clearing broker. In margin transactions, the clearing broker extends credit to the customers, subject to various regulatory and margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the customer’s account. In connection with these activities, the clearing broker may also execute and clear customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased.\n\nThese transactions may expose the Company to significant off-balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses which the customers may incur. In the event the customers fail to satisfy their obligations to the clearing broker, the Company may be required to compensate the clearing broker for losses incurred on behalf of the customers.\n\nThe Company, through its clearing broker, seeks to control the risk associated with its customers’ activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, management of the Company had not been notified by any clearing brokers, nor were they otherwise aware of any potential losses relating to this indemnification.\n\n​\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**14.** COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\nThe Company is authorized to issue 57,000,000 shares consisting of the following:\n\n●| 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 1,519,500 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024; and  \n---|---  \n●| 55,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 16,602,460 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024.  \n---|---  \n  \n**15.****NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS**\n\nThe Company operates four registered broker-dealers that are subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1). This requires the Company to maintain certain minimum net capital requirements. As of and for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all broker-dealers had net capital in excess of the required minimums.\n\n**16.** CREDIT RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS\n\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The Company performs certain credit evaluation procedures and does not require collateral for financial instruments subject to credit risk. The Company believes that credit risk is limited because the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its counterparties and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of its counterparties, establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts and, consequently, believes that its receivables credit risk exposure beyond such allowances is limited.\n\n**17.** SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date up to August 14, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n_The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. References to the “Company,” “us” or “we” refer to Binah Capital Group, Inc._\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\n _This Quarterly Report on Form10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings._\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nBinah Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company), is a leading consolidator of retail wealth management businesses that owns and operates ten entities, four of which are broker-dealers, three of which are registered investment advisors, and three of which are insurance entities, that have over 1900 registered individuals working within the financial services industries.\n\nThe Company focuses on three critical areas comprised of the hybrid, independent and W2 business models to allow affiliated advisors to choose the operating model that works best for them and run their practices on their own terms. The Company’s platform adds to its flexibility by providing a variety of custody and clearing firm options to accommodate the unique business needs of advisors.\n\nThe Merger\n\nOn March 15, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), Binah Capital consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 7, 2022 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement” and the consummation of such contemplated transactions, the “Closing”), by and among Kingswood Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation (“KWAC”), Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Kingswood Merger Sub”), Wentworth Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth Merger Sub”), and Wentworth Management Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth”). Binah Capital, Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transaction set forth in the Merger Agreement. Binah Capital was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of KWAC and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub were wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Binah Capital. On the Closing Date, Kingswood Merger Sub merged with and into KWAC, with KWAC continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital and Wentworth Merger Sub merged with and into Wentworth, with Wentworth continuing as the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Binah Capital. Following the Wentworth merger, KWAC acquired, and Binah Capital contributed to KWAC all of the common units of Wentworth directly held by Binah Capital after the Wentworth merger, such that, following the Binah Capital contribution, Wentworth became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KWAC.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, (i) the holders of shares of KWAC’s common stock (“KWAC Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (other than any redeemed shares) received one share of common stock of Holdings (“Holdings Common Stock”) in exchange for each share of KWAC Common Stock held by them, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, (ii) 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock issued to Sponsor was placed by Holdings into an escrow account and will not be released to the Sponsor unless the dollar volume-weighted average price of Holdings Common Stock exceeds $12.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the four-year period following the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) the holders of each whole warrant to purchase KWAC Class A Common Stock received one warrant to purchase Holdings Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, (iv) 12 million shares of Holdings Common Stock, subject to adjustment as more fully described herein, was issued to the equity holders of Wentworth in proportion to their ownership interests in Wentworth, (v) an additional 1,100,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock was issued to certain equity holders of Wentworth, (vi) 3,084,450 KWAC Private Placement Warrants held by Sponsor were forfeited immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination, and (vii) 3,084,450 warrants to purchase Holding Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share were issued to the equity holders of Wentworth in proportion to their ownership interests in Wentworth. As a result of the Business Combination, Wentworth became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, Holdings entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for the purchase of 1,500,000 shares of Holdings’ Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Holdings Series A Stock”) in a private placement at $9.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,400,000 (the “Series A PIPE”). The Holdings Series A Stock may be converted into shares of Holdings Common Stock after the second anniversary of the closing of the Series A PIPE, which such conversion shall initially be 1.5 shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments provided in the Certificate of Designations.\n\nOur Sources of Revenue\n\nOur revenue is derived primarily from fees and commissions from products and advisory services offered by our advisors to their clients, a substantial portion of which we pay out to our advisors.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nResults for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024 included a net loss of approximately $(0.7) million and $(2.3) million and total revenue of approximately $40.6 million and $82.1 million, respectively, which compares to net income and total revenue of $0.1 million and $1.2 million and approximately $40.4 million and $83.8 million, respectively, for the three and six month period ended June 30, 2023.\n\nAsset Trends\n\nTotal advisory and brokerage assets served were $25.1 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $23.1 billion at June 30, 2023. Total net new assets were $(0.8) billion and $(2.2) billion for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $(1.0) billion and $(2.1) billion for the same period in 2023.\n\nNet new advisory assets were $0.0 billion and $(0.1) billion for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $(0.3) billion and $(0.4) billion for the same period in 2023. Advisory assets were $2.3 billion at June 30, 2024, which is approximately a 13% increase from the $2.0 billion at June 30, 2023.\n\nNet new brokerage assets were $(0.8) billion and $(2.1) billion for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024, compared to $(0.7) billion and $(1.7) billion for the same period in 2023. Brokerage assets were $22.8 billion at June 30, 2024, up approximately 8% from $21.1 billion at June 30, 2023.\n\nGross Profit Trend\n\nGross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $7.3 million and $15.1 million for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of 3% from $7.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and a decrease of 5% from $15.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. See the _“Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures”_ section for additional information on gross profit.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nKey Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe focus on several key metrics in evaluating the success of our business relationships and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Our key metrics of Gross Profit and EBITDA are “non-GAAP financial measures.” Our management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined under the rules of the SEC, to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Gross Profit and EBITDA provide investors and analysts useful insight into our financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nGross profit is defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue. We consider our gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight into our core operating performance before other costs that are general and administrative in nature.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appears below in the footnotes to the table of our key operating, business and financial metrics.\n\nOur key operating, business and financial metrics are as follows:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **As of and for the Periods Ended June 30,**  \nOperating Metric (dollars in billions)| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| ​  \nBrokerage assets| ​| $|  22.8| ​| $|  21.1  \nAdvisory assets| ​|  2.3| ​|  2.0  \n**Total Advisory and Brokerage Assets**|  ​| $|  25.1| ​| $|  23.1  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended June 30,**|  ​| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**Net New Assets**|  2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet new brokerage assets| ​| $|  (0.8)| ​| $|  (0.7)| ​| $|  (2.1)| ​| $|  (1.7)  \nNet new advisory assets| ​|  (0.0)| ​|  (0.3)| ​|  (0.1)| ​|  (0.4)  \nTotal Net New Assets| ​| $|  (0.8)| ​| $|  (1.0)| ​| $|  (2.2)| ​| $|  (2.1)  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the three months ended**| **For the six months ended**  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| **June 30,**  \nFinancial Metrics (dollars in millions)| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nTotal revenue| ​| $|  40.6| ​| $|  40.4| ​| $|  82.1| ​| $|  83.8  \nNet income| ​| $|  (0.7)| ​| $|  0.1| ​| $|  (2.3)| ​| $|  1.2  \nNon-GAAP Financial Metrics (dollars in millions)| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nGross Profit(1)| ​| $|  7.3| ​| $|  7.5| ​| $|  15.1| ​| $|  15.8  \nEBITDA(2)| ​| $|  0.6| ​| $|  2.2| ​| $|  0.5| ​| $|  5.0  \n(1)| Gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue.

Although inflation, rising interest rates and volatile global markets were all headwinds the U.S. economy added roughly 503,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate averaged 4.0% in the second quarter of 2024, up slightly from the average in the prior quarter.\n\nOur business is also sensitive to current and expected short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by Fed policy. During the second quarter of 2024, Fed policymakers maintained the target range for the federal funds rate from 5.25% to 5.50%.

We also generate interest income in accordance with our agreements with our clearing partners. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we record revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients’ purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products.\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are recognized on the trade date or the transaction date, which represents the completion of the Company’s performance obligation because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer at a point in time. The rates at which commissions are charged to the customers range from 1% to 7% based on the investment product. Trailing commission revenues which are preliminarily related to the sales of mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of the Company’s advisors are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients’ investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally based on a fixed rate applied, generally twenty-five to fifty basis points (25-50 bps) of the current market value of the clients’ holdings. Trailing commissions are generally received monthly or quarterly. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and the client’s investment hold period and the Company does not believe that it can overcome such constraints until the market value of the fund and the investor activities are known. The revenues will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\nThe Company is principal for the commission revenue, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients’ purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing it obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenue is reported on a gross basis. See Note 4 - Revenues From Contracts with Customers within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 for further details regarding our commission revenue by product category.\n\nThe following tables sets forth the components of our commission revenue for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the three-month period ended June 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| **$Change**|  ​| **% Change**  \nSales-based| ​| $|  15,850| ​| $|  21,964|  (6,214)|  (28)| %  \nTrailing| ​|  17,813| ​|  11,358|  6,456|  57| %  \nTotal commission revenue| ​| $|  33,663| ​| $|  33,322|  242|  1| %  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the six-month period ended June 30,**  \n​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**| **$Change**| **% Change**|  ​  \nSales-based| ​| $|  31,617| ​| $|  37,245|  (5,628)|  (15)| %   \nTrailing| ​|  36,441| ​|  31,398|  5,043|  16| %   \nTotal commission revenue| ​| $|  68,057| ​| $|  68,643|  (585)|  (1)| %   \n  \n​\n\nSales-based revenue decreased by approximately $6.2 million and $5.6 million or 28% and 15% for the three and six-month period ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023. Trailing based revenue increased by approximately $6.4 million and $5.0 million or 57% and 16% for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023. The decrease in sales-based revenue for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is attributable to a decrease in the generation of transactional based products. The increase in the trailing based revenues is primarily due to the net increase in trailing based assets and increase in the market performance Commission revenue is generated from brokerage assets.

These fees are recognized ratably over time to match the continued delivery of the performance obligations to the client over the life of the contract. The advisory fees generated from the Company’s corporate advisory platform are based on a percentage of the market value of the eligible assets in the clients’ advisory accounts.\n\nAdvisory fees increased by approximately 20.2% and 10.3% for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in June 30, 2023, due to positive returns in the market offset by outflows of advisory assets.\n\nThe following tables summarizes the advisory assets for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in billions):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of June 30 ,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**  \nAdvisory Assets| ​| $|  2.3| ​| $|  2.0  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes activity impacting advisory assets for the periods ended (in billions):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the three month ended June 30,**|  ​| **For the six months ended June 30,**  \n**Net Flows-Advisory Assets**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nBalance – beginning of period| $|  2.2| ​| $|  2.2| ​| ​|  2.1| ​| ​|  2.1  \nNet new brokerage assets| $|  (0.0)| ​| $|  (0.3)| ​| ​|  (0.1)| ​| ​|  (0.4)  \nMarket impact| $|  0.1| ​| $|  0.1| ​| ​|  0.3| ​| ​|  0.3  \nBalance – End of period| $|  2.3| ​| $|  2.0| ​| $|  2.3| ​| $|  2.0  \n(1)| Net new advisory assets consist of total client deposits less client withdrawals from custodial accounts, plus dividends, plus interest, minus advisory fees.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Market impact is the difference between the beginning and ending asset balances less the net new asset amounts, representing the implied growth or decline in asset balances due to market change over the same period of time.  \n---|---  \n  \nInterest and other income\n\nInterest income includes amounts earned on balances held at the Company’s clearing brokers related to cash balances and margin balances. The Company’s clearing agreements include provisions that provide for a sharing of the interest income earned on such balances with the clearing brokers. The rate varies based on the clearing broker.\n\nOther income primarily includes amounts earned by the Company related to marketing and incentives earned from the sales of certain investment products by the financial advisors to its clients, primarily alternative investments, as well as sponsorship income.\n\nThe decrease in interest and other income for the period ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2023 is primarily related to a non-recurring income item that was earned in March 2023.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nCommissions and Fees\n\nCommissions and fees primarily consist of commissions paid to the financial advisors, technology costs associated with the platform for which the financial advisors operate their business, insurance costs and regulatory costs. Certain of the technology, insurance and regulatory costs are passed through to the financial advisors and any excess costs are included as fees within commissions and fees. The commissions and fees paid to the financial advisors are based on the advisory and commission revenue earned on each client’s account. The payout amount is production based, which is the gross revenue produced by the financial advisor, and varies based on the level of such production ranging from 50% to 95% of the revenue generated. The production levels begin at gross revenue of $15,000 up to $4,000,000 and up, and the payout rate starts at 50% and increases to a top payout rate of 94% for annual production of $4,000,000 and up.\n\nThe following table sets forth our payout rate, which is a statistical or operating measure and monitored to review that such costs of revenue remain consistent on a period over period basis:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the three months ended June 30,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nPayout range|  83.42| % |  85.31| % |  (1.89)| %  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the six months ended June 30,**|  ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nPayout range|  83.69| % |  85.50| % |  (1.81)  \n  \n​\n\nFor the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, the payout rate decreased as compared to 2023 as a result of in the prior year there was a non-recurring commissionable product that carried a payout at approximately 90%.\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits includes salaries, wages, benefits and related taxes for our employees.\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2023, increased by approximately 9%.\n\nEmployee compensation and benefits for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2023, increased by approximately 4%.\n\n​\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Rent and occupancy**\n\nRent and occupancy for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2023 decreasing by approximately 7%.\n\nRent and occupancy for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2023 decreasing by approximately 5%.\n\nProfessional fees\n\nProfessional fees includes costs incurred related primarily to legal and accounting services.

The difference in our effective tax rate was related to the transaction expenses related to the Reverse Recapitalization.\n\nLiquidity and capital resources\n\nWe have established liquidity policies intended to support the execution of strategic initiatives, while meeting regulatory capital requirements and maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and, in particular, to our broker-dealer subsidiaries, PKSI, CLS, MSI and WEG.

Although these estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe define our critical accounting policies and estimates as those that require us to make subjective judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Management exercises judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenue on a net basis). For additional information see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six-months periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units.\n\nWe performed our goodwill impairment test as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The estimated fair value of the reporting units were determined using the market approach for each reporting unit, relying specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. As a result of the 2023 and 2022 annual impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting units was 257% and 266% greater than its carrying value, respectively. Since there have been no events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting units were below their carrying amount, interim goodwill tests were not considered necessary.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, economic trends and market conditions, changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies, unanticipated competition, discount rates, technology, or government regulations. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider other information, such as public market comparable and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments, and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\n\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.\n\nWhen a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management’s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note 2 -  _Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,_ within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, to us.\n\n​\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nItem 3.

Each of the Company and Executive is a “Party,” and collectively, they are the “Parties.”\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, Executive is currently employed as President of Wentworth Management Services, LLC (“Wentworth”) and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Cabot Lodge Securities (“Cabot Lodge”);\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, following the closing of the SPAC transaction (the “Closing”), Wentworth is a subsidiary of the Company, which is a successor to Kingswood Acquisition Corporation;\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Executive in the position of Chief Executive Officer, and Executive desires to accept such offer;\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, as of the Effective Date, the Parties agree that Executive, and Executive’s employment agreements with Wentworth and Cabot Lodge will be superseded hereby;\n\n​\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows commencing on the Effective Date:\n\n​\n\n1._Employment_. The Company hereby employs Executive, and Executive hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n\n​\n\n2._Duties_.\n\n​\n\n2.1 _Position_. Executive is employed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Executive will report to the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) and will have the duties and responsibilities assigned by the Board and consistent with such position. Executive will perform faithfully and diligently all duties assigned to Executive.\n\n​\n\n2.2 _Best Efforts/Full-time_. Executive will expend Executive’s best efforts on behalf of the Company and will abide by all of the Company’s policies and by applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations or ordinances. Executive will act in the best interest of the Company at all times. Executive will devote Executive’s full business time and efforts to the performance of Executive’s assigned duties for the Company, unless Executive notifies the Board in advance of Executive’s intent to engage in other paid work and receives express written consent from such individual to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive will be permitted to (i) engage in the activities listed on _Exhibit A_ hereto (as such exhibit may be amended from time to time with the written agreement of Executive and the Board), and (ii) serve as an outside director on the board of directors for nonprofit or charitable entities or manage Executive’s personal financial and legal affairs; in each case, so long as the foregoing activities are not competitive with the Company and subject to the provisions of Section 10 below.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n[***] Indicates material that has been excluded from this Exhibit 10.1 because it is not material.\n\n​\n\n2.3 _Work Location_. Executive’s principal place of work will be located in Chicago, Illinois, or such other location as the Company may direct from time to time in connection with the performance of Executive’s duties. Executive may work remotely from time to time from locations in the continental United States.\n\n​\n\n3._Term_. Executive’s employment will commence, and this Agreement will be effective as of the Effective Date and will continue for a term of five (5) years thereafter (the “Initial Term”), unless extended or earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement. At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term (defined below), the Executive shall notify the Board of whether the Executive would like to renew this agreement (the “Renewal Notice”) for a successive three (3) year period following the last day of the Initial Term. The Board will consider whether to offer the Executive an extension under this Agreement (such three-year extension, a “Renewal Term”). If the Board decides in its sole and absolute discretion to approve the Renewal Notice, it will notify the Executive accordingly (the “Renewal Approval”), not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Each subsequent Renewal Term will renew, subject to a timely Renewal Notice and Renewal Approval for each additional Renewal Term, on the last day of each Renewal Term (each, Renewal Term together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). During any Renewal Term, the terms, conditions and provisions set forth in this Agreement will remain in effect unless modified in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive’s employment with the Company is at-will and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause (as defined below) or advance notice, by either Executive or the Company, subject to the provisions regarding termination set forth below in Section 7.\n\n​\n\n4._Compensation_.\n\n​\n\n4.1 _Base Salary_. As compensation for Executive’s performance of Executive’s duties hereunder, the Company will pay to Executive an annualized salary of $600,000, less applicable withholdings and deductions, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices of the Company. Beginning in calendar year 2025, the Company’s Compensation Committee will conduct an annual review of Executive’s base salary based on third party comparison data and internal management recommendations. Executive’s base salary may be increased but may not be decreased without Executive’s prior written approval.\n\n​\n\n4.2 _Incentive Compensation_. Beginning in calendar year 2024, Executive will be eligible to earn an annual incentive bonus based on criteria similar to other senior executives of the Company (the “Annual Bonus”), provided that whether Executive receives an Annual Bonus, and the criteria used to determine the amount of such Annual Bonus, will be at the sole discretion of the Board but will not be less than the annual bonus of any other executive of the Company. The Annual Bonus payment will be less all required taxes and withholdings and, if earned by Executive, paid out in the next year no later than March 31 of such year following the year for which the bonus is earned. For avoidance of doubt, Executive will be entitled to any Annual Bonus that has been earned with respect to a particular bonus year so long as he is employed on December 31 of such year (regardless of whether he is employed on the date on which such Annual Bonus is actually paid).\n\n​\n\n​\n\n4.4 _Equity Compensation_.\n\n​\n\n(a)No later than six (6) months after the Closing, but after the filing of an S-8 registration statement for the Plan (as defined herein), subject to Executive’s continuous service through the grant date, the Company will grant Executive nonqualified stock options to purchase 600,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to any reasonable capitalization adjustments before the date of grant (the “Initial Options”), under the terms of the Company’s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the “Plan”). The Initial Options will be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the option agreement and Plan. The exercise price of the Initial Options will be equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting schedule of the Initial Options will be as follows: 1/3 of the Initial Options will vest on December 31, 2024, and the remaining 2/3 of the Initial Options ratably on the last day of each calendar month following the initial vesting date through December 31, 2026, based on continued service through each vesting date, with the first such monthly vesting date being on January 31, 2025; provided, however, that the Initial Options will accelerate and be deemed vested in full upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).\n\n​\n\n(b)On each anniversary of the Closing, subject to Executive’s continuous service through the grant date, the Company will grant Executive nonqualified stock options to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which have a grant date fair value equal to Executive’s annual base salary at the time of each such grant, as reasonably determined by the Board (the “Additional Options”), under the terms of the Plan. The Additional Options will be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the option agreement and Plan. The exercise price of the Additional Options will be equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting schedule of the Additional Options will be ratable monthly over three years from the date of the grant, subject to accelerated vesting upon a Change in Control, as defined in the Plan, based on continued service through each vesting date; provided, however, that the Additional Options will accelerate and be deemed vested in full upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).\n\n​\n\n(c)The Initial Options and the Additional Options will be granted pursuant to options award agreements that include a cashless exercise provision.\n\n​\n\n(d)After the filing of a registration statement on Form S-8 for the Plan, subject to Executive’s continuous service through the grant date, the Company will grant to Executive 500,000 restricted stock units settled in shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to any reasonable capitalization adjustments before the date of grant, with one-half of the grant vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder of the grant vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant based on Executive’s continued service through each vesting date.\n\n​\n\n(e)During 2024, after the filing of a registration statement on Form S-8 for the Plan, during Executive’s continuous service, the Company will grant to Executive a fully vested share grant with a grant date fair market value of $220,000. If, during 2025, Executive continues to provide a personal guarantee on Company debt, during Executive’s continuous service, the\n\n​\n\nCompany will grant to Executive a fully vested share grant with a grant date fair market value of $220,000.\n\n​\n\n5._Benefits_.\n\n​\n\n5.1 _Customary Fringe Benefits_. Executive will be eligible for all customary and usual fringe benefits generally available to executives of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s benefit plan documents. The Company reserves the right to change or eliminate the fringe benefits on a prospective basis, at any time, effective upon notice to Executive.\n\n​\n\n5.2 _Vacation_. Executive will be provided with the greater of (a) four (4) weeks’ paid vacation per calendar year, or (b) such greater amount of paid vacation weeks per calendar year as may be provided for pursuant to the Company’s vacation policy then in effect. Any accrued unused vacation from one calendar year may be carried over to the next calendar year. Executive will also be entitled to paid sick leave as provided under applicable law.\n\n​\n\n5.3 _Membership Fees_. The Company will reimburse Executive for fees and costs associated with business-related memberships and affiliations, gym membership, and social club membership.\n\n​\n\n5.4 _Concierge Medical Services_.

Furthermore, to the extent that Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of the Section 409A Regulations as of the date of Executive’s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of Executive’s separation from service will be paid to Executive before the date (“Delayed Payment Date”) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of Executive’s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of Executive’s death following such separation from service. All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date.\n\n​\n\n9.2The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code. The provisions of this Agreement will be interpreted and construed in favor of satisfying any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code. **However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect for income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.** In any event, except for the Company’s responsibility to withhold applicable income and employment taxes from compensation paid or provided to Executive, the Company will not be responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes on compensation paid or provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement. The Parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either Party, to the extent necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations thereunder in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either Party.\n\n​\n\n9.3Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits provided pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the following\n\n​\n\nconditions: (1) the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits in one taxable year will not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits in any other taxable year; (2) the reimbursement of eligible expenses or in-kind benefits will be made promptly, subject to the Company’s applicable policies, but in no event later than the end of the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (3) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.\n\n​\n\n9.4For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement will be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.\n\n​\n\n10._No Conflict of Interest_. During the Term, Executive agrees not to engage in any work, paid or unpaid, or other activities that create a conflict of interest. Such work and/or activities will include, but is not limited to, directly or indirectly competing with the Company in any way, or acting as an officer, director, employee, consultant, stockholder, volunteer, lender, or agent of any business enterprise of the same nature as, or which is in direct competition with, the business in which the Company is now engaged or in which the Company becomes engaged during the term of Executive’s employment with the Company, as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. If the Company believes such a conflict exists during the term of this Agreement, the Company may ask Executive to, and Executive will, discontinue the other work and/or activities or resign employment with the Company.\n\n​\n\n11._Nondisclosure of Confidential Information_.\n\n​\n\n11.1Executive recognizes that the knowledge and information about, and relationships with business associates, customers, clients and agents of the Company and its affiliated companies, and the business methods, systems, plans, and policies of the Company and of its affiliated companies, which Executive may receive, obtain, or establish as an employee of the Company are valuable and unique assets of the Company or its affiliates. Executive agrees that, during any employment period and thereafter, except in the course of performing his duties under this Agreement, Executive will not disclose or remove, without the written consent of the Company, (i) any material or substantial, confidential, or proprietary know-how, data, or information, including, but not limited to software, data, information relating to customers and clients, pricing, training manuals, mandatory processes and means or techniques pertaining to the Company or its affiliates, (ii) any business plans, strategies, targets, or directives, to any person, firm, corporation, or any other entity, for any reason or purpose whatsoever and (iii) any other information deemed by the Company to be confidential, whether marked or otherwise labeled or identified as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). Executive acknowledges and agrees that all memoranda, notes, records, clients lists, client information and other documents, computer software, data or material or any other Confidential Information in any form made or compiled by Executive or made available to Executive concerning the Company’s business is and will be the Company’s exclusive property and will be delivered by Executive to the Company upon termination of Executive’s employment or at any other time upon the request of the Company.\n\n​\n\n11.2The restrictions in the above paragraph will not apply to: (1) information that at the time of disclosure is in the public domain through no fault of Executive’s;\n\n​\n\n(2) information received from a third party outside of the Company that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; (3) information approved for release by written authorization of the Company; or (4) information that may be required by law or an order of any court, agency or proceeding to be disclosed. Executive will provide the Company notice of any such required disclosure once Executive has knowledge of it and will help the Company to the extent reasonable to obtain an appropriate protective order.\n\n​\n\n11.3The Company acknowledges that Executive has had significant prior work experience in the industry in which the Company is engaged, and that Executive enters into this Agreement with significant prior knowledge, information and relationships in such industry.\n\n​\n\n12._Company Covenants_. As a result of the relationship created further to this Agreement, upon the execution of this Agreement by both Parties, the Company agrees to, and will, place Executive in a position of special trust, and it will provide Executive with: (a) Confidential Information (which includes trade secrets) and access to such information; (b) specialized training, which may include self-study materials, on-line training, on the job training, and instruction as to Company’s products, services, business relationships, and methods of operation; and (c) goodwill support such as expense reimbursements in accordance with Company’s policies, Confidential Information related to Company’s current and prospective clients, customers, business associates, vendors, and suppliers, and contact and relationships with current and potential clients, customers, business associates, vendors, and suppliers to help Executive develop goodwill for the Company. The foregoing is not contingent on Executive’s continued employment for any length of time, but is contingent on Executive’s full compliance with the restrictions in Section 13.\n\n​\n\n13._Employee Covenants_. Executive specifically acknowledges that the items described in Section 12 will be items that Executive has not previously been given, and that Executive would not be given but for the execution of this Agreement. Executive agrees not to, directly or indirectly, participate in the unauthorized use, disclosure, or conversion of any Confidential Information. Specifically, but without limitation, Executive agrees not to use Confidential Information for Executive’s sole benefit, or for the benefit of any person or entity in any way that harms the Company or diminishes the value of the Confidential Information to the Company. Executive also agrees to use the specialized training, goodwill, and contacts developed with the Company’s customers/clients and contractors for the exclusive benefit of the Company, and Executive agrees not to use these items at any time in a way that would harm the business interests of the Company. However, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any government agency or entity, making other disclosures that are protected under whistleblower provisions of law, or receiving an award or monetary recovery pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower program. Executive understands that Executive does not need prior authorization to make such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Company if Executive has made or will make any such report or disclosure.\n\n​\n\n13.1 _Goodwill with Customers_. Executive acknowledges that the Company has near permanent relationships with its customers and owns the goodwill in those relationships with customers that Executive will develop or maintain in the course and scope of Executive’s employment with the Company. If Executive owned goodwill in a relationship with a customer\n\n​\n\non the Effective Date, Executive hereby assigns any and all such goodwill to the Company, and the Company will become the owner of such goodwill.\n\n​\n\n13.2 _Covenant Not to Compete_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, while employed by the Company and during the twelve (12)-month period immediately following the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company, regardless of the reason for such termination (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not, directly or indirectly render services in the Restricted Territories (whether as owner, operator, member, shareholder, trustee, manager, consultant, strategic partner, employee, or otherwise) that are the same or substantially similar to the services Executive provided to the Company during the 12-month period preceding the end of Executive’s employment, to a Competing Business. For purposes hereof, a “Competing Business” means an entity that provides the same types of services, products, or other offerings as provided by the Company, and “Restricted Territories” means the State of Illinois and the State of New York.\n\n​\n\n13.3 _Non-solicitation of Customers_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Executive will not directly or indirectly solicit, cause to be solicited, assist, or otherwise be involved with the solicitation of, for or on behalf of a Competing Business, any persons or entities within the Restricted Territories who are known to Executive as a result of Executive’s employment with the Company, and who were customers or clients of the Company during the twelve (12)-month period preceding the end of Executive’s employment with the Company and about which Executive possesses or received Confidential Information or with whom Executive had substantial personal contact during the period of Executive’s employment.\n\n​\n\n13.4 _Non-solicitation of Employees and Contractors_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Executive will not solicit, encourage, or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or independent contractors of the Company, who are known to Executive as a result of his employment with the Company, to terminate their employment with the Company.\n\n​\n\n13.5 _Acknowledgment_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive’s services to be rendered to the Company are of a special and unique character, that Executive will obtain knowledge and skill relevant to the Company’s business, its methods, and its strategies by virtue of Executive’s employment, and that the restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions of this Agreement are reasonable and reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, including the Company’s trade secrets and other Confidential Information, and are ancillary to the enforceable promises between Executive and the Company in the other sections of this Agreement as well as Executive’s employment with the Company. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the observance of the covenants set forth herein will not cause Executive undue hardship nor will it unreasonably interfere with Executive’s ability to earn a livelihood either during or following Executive’s employment with the Company. Further, the Parties acknowledge that the foregoing restrictive covenants are essential elements of\n\n​\n\nthis Agreement, and that, but for Executive’s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n13.6 _Tolling_. Executive agrees that if Executive is deemed by a court or other tribunal to have violated any of the terms of the restrictive covenant obligations in this Section 13, the Restricted Period will be extended by one day for each day that Executive failed to comply with the restriction at issue and, further, the Non-Competition Consideration shall cease or be repaid by Executive for each month of such breach during the Restricted Period.\n\n​\n\n14._Enforcement; Remedies; Construction_.\n\n​\n\n14.1Executive covenants, agrees, and recognizes the breach or threatened breach of the covenants, or any of them, contained in Sections 11, 12 and 13 will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Company and that the Company will be entitled to an injunction restraining Executive or any of his affiliates from any violation of Sections 11, 12 and 13 to the fullest extent allowed by law. Executive further covenants and agrees that in the event of a violation of any of his respective covenants and agreements contained in Sections 11, 12 and 13 hereof, the Company will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the requirement to post bond. Nothing herein will be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available to it for any such breach or threatened breach, including but not limited to monetary damages.\n\n​\n\n14.2Executive hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees as follows:\n\n​\n\n(a)that he has read the covenants set forth above in Sections 11, 12 and 13, has had an opportunity to discuss them with an attorney and that such covenants are reasonable in all respects and are necessary to protect the legitimate business and competitive interests of the Company; and\n\n(b)that each of the covenants set forth in Sections 11, 12 and 13 and the subdivisions thereof are separately and independently given, and each such covenant is intended to be enforceable separately and independently of the other such covenants, including, without limitation, enforcement by injunction without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security; provided, however, that the invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement in any respect will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement in any other respect. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction by reason of the geographic or business scope or the duration thereof or for any other reason, such invalidity or unenforceability will attach only to the particular aspect of such provision found invalid or unenforceable as applied and will not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement or the enforcement of such provision in other circumstances, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this Agreement will be construed as if the geographic or business scope or the duration of such provision or other basis on which such provision has been challenged had been more narrowly drafted so as not to be invalid or unenforceable.\n\n​\n\n14.3Nothing in Sections 10, 12 and 13 will prohibit Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) an owner of not more\n\n​\n\nthan two percent (2%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation, any securities of which are publicly traded, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.\n\n​\n\n15._General Provisions_.\n\n​\n\n15.1 _Successors and Assigns_. The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company. Executive will not be entitled to assign any of Executive’s rights or obligations under this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n15.2 _Waiver_. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, or prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n15.3 _Attorneys’ Fees_. In the event of litigation between the Parties with respect to this Agreement or the interpretation or enforcement hereof, the non-prevailing party shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing arty, in addition to such other damages as may be awarded.\n\n​\n\n15.4 _Severability_. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the Parties will receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such court, the unenforceable provision will be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected thereby.\n\n​\n\n15.5 _Interpretation; Construction_. The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that Executive has had an opportunity to review and revise the Agreement and have it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n15.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware. Each Party consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the chancery, state or federal courts of Delaware, if applicable, in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n15.7 _Notices_.

Each of the Company and Executive is a “Party,” and collectively, they are the “Parties.”\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, Executive is currently engaged as a consultant of Kingswood Acquisition Corporation (“Kingswood”) and Wentworth Management Services, LLC (“Wentworth”);\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, following the closing of the proposed SPAC transaction (the “Closing”), Wentworth is a subsidiary of the Company, which is a successor to Kingswood;\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, the Company desires to employ Executive in the position of Chief Financial Officer, and Executive desires to accept such offer;\n\n​\n\nWHEREAS, as of the Effective Date, the Parties agree that any consulting agreements or similar arrangements between Executive, on the one hand, and Kingswood and Wentworth, on the other hand, will terminate and will no longer remain in effect;\n\n​\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows commencing on the Effective Date:\n\n​\n\n1._Employment_. The Company hereby employs Executive, and Executive hereby accepts such employment, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n\n​\n\n2._Duties_.\n\n​\n\n2.1 _Position_. Executive is employed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Executive will report to the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) of the Company and will have the duties and responsibilities assigned by such individual that are consistent with such position. Executive will perform faithfully and diligently all such duties assigned to Executive.\n\n​\n\n2.2 _Best Efforts/Full-time_. Executive will expend Executive’s best efforts on behalf of the Company and will abide by all of the Company’s policies and by applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances. Executive will act in the best interest of the Company at all times. Executive will devote Executive’s full business time and efforts to the performance of Executive’s assigned duties for the Company, unless Executive notifies the CEO in advance of Executive’s intent to engage in other paid work and receives express written consent from such individual to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive will be permitted to (i) engage in the activities listed on _Exhibit A_ hereto (as such exhibit may be amended from time to time with the written agreement of Executive and the CEO), and (ii) serve as an outside director on the board of directors for nonprofit or charitable entities or manage Executive’s personal financial and legal affairs; in each case, so long as the foregoing activities are not competitive with the Company and subject to the provisions of Section 10 below.\n\n​\n\n[***] Indicates material that has been excluded from this Exhibit 10.2 because it is not material.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n2.3 _Work Location_. Executive may work remotely from locations in the continental United States.\n\n​\n\n3._Term_. Executive’s employment will commence, and this Agreement will be effective as of the Effective Date and will continue for a term of three (3) years thereafter (the “Initial Term”), unless extended or earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement. At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term (defined below), the Executive shall notify the Board of whether the Executive would like to renew this agreement (the “Renewal Notice”) for a successive one (1) year period following the last day of the Initial Term. The Board will consider whether to offer the Executive an extension under this Agreement (such one-year extension, a “Renewal Term”). If the Board decides in its sole and absolute discretion to approve the Renewal Notice, it will notify the Executive accordingly (the “Renewal Approval”), not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Each subsequent Renewal Term will renew, subject to a timely Renewal Notice and Renewal Approval for each additional Renewal Term, on the last day of each Renewal Term (each Renewal Term together with the Initial Term, the “Term”). During any Renewal Term, the terms, conditions and provisions set forth in this Agreement will remain in effect unless modified in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive’s employment with the Company is at-will and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause (as defined below) or advance notice, by either Executive or the Company, subject to the provisions regarding termination set forth below in Section 7.\n\n​\n\n4._Compensation_.\n\n​\n\n4.1 _Base Salary_. As compensation for Executive’s performance of Executive’s duties hereunder, the Company will pay to Executive an annualized salary of $400,000, less applicable withholdings and deductions, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices of the Company. Beginning in calendar year 2025, the Company’s Compensation Committee will conduct an annual review of Executive’s base salary based on third party comparison data and internal management recommendations. Executive’s base salary may be increased but may not be decreased without Executive’s prior written approval.\n\n​\n\n4.2 _Incentive Compensation_. Beginning in calendar year 2024, Executive will be eligible to earn an annual incentive bonus, the target amount of which will be a percentage of Executive’s base salary as reasonably determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Annual Bonus”). The target amount of the Annual Bonus for each calendar year of the Term will be up to 100% of Executive’s base salary based on the actual base salary earned by Executive during such calendar year (the “Target Annual Bonus Amount”); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Executive will receive an Annual Bonus of no less than $350,000 for calendar year 2024, and provided further that Executive may be eligible for an Annual Bonus of up to 200% of Executive’s base salary in effect during the applicable Annual Bonus year, based on Executive’s exceptional performance during such year. Any Annual Bonus will be based on Company performance and Executive’s achievement of certain goals, which will be established in good faith by the Company’s Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and communicated to Executive in writing within sixty (60) days after the beginning of each fiscal year. The Annual Bonus payment will be\n\n​\n\n2\n\n​\n\nless all required taxes and withholdings and, if earned by Executive, paid out in the next year no later than March 31 of such year following the year for which the bonus is earned. For avoidance of doubt, Executive will be entitled to any Annual Bonus that has been earned with respect to a particular bonus year so long as he is employed on December 31 of such year (regardless of whether he is employed on the date on which such Annual Bonus is actually paid).\n\n​\n\n4.3 _Stock Options_.\n\n​\n\n(a)No later than six (6) months after the Closing, the Company will grant Executive nonqualified stock options to purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to any reasonable capitalization adjustments before the date of grant (the “Initial Options”), under the terms of the Company’s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the “Plan”). The Initial Options will be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the option agreement and the Plan. The exercise price of the Initial Options will be equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting schedule of the Initial Options will be as follows: 1/3 of the Initial Options will vest on December 31, 2024, and the remaining 2/3 of the Initial Options ratably on the last day of each calendar month following the initial vesting date through December 31, 2026, based on continued service through each vesting date, with the first such monthly vesting date being on January 31, 2025; provided, however, that the Initial Options will accelerate and be deemed vested in full upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).\n\n​\n\n(b)On each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing, the Company will grant Executive nonqualified stock options to purchase that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which have a grant date fair value equal to $350,000, as reasonably determined by the Board (the “Additional Options”), under the terms of the Plan. The Additional Options will be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the option agreement and Plan. The exercise price of the Additional Options will be equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting schedule of the Additional Options will be ratable monthly over three years from the date of the grant, based on continued service through each vesting date; provided, however, that the Additional Options will accelerate and be deemed vested in full upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).\n\n​\n\n(c)The Initial Options and the Additional Options will be granted pursuant to options award agreements that include a cashless exercise provision.\n\n​\n\n(d)All options granted by the Company will be forfeited upon Executive’s termination for Cause. All option grants will be subject to the terms of the applicable grant agreement and Plan.\n\n​\n\n5._Benefits_.\n\n​\n\n5.1 _Customary Fringe Benefits_. Executive will be eligible for all customary and usual fringe benefits generally available to executives of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s benefit plan documents.

Executive will be provided with the greater of (a) four (4) weeks’ paid vacation per calendar year, or (b) such greater amount of paid vacation weeks per calendar year as may be provided for pursuant to the Company’s vacation policy then in effect.

Executive will also be entitled to paid sick leave as provided under applicable law.\n\n​\n\n6._Business Expenses_. Executive will be reimbursed for all reasonable, out-of-pocket business expenses incurred in the performance of Executive’s duties on behalf of the Company, including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with Executive’s professional fees, dues and expenses. To obtain reimbursement, expenses must be submitted on a timely basis with appropriate supporting documentation and will be reimbursed in accordance with the Company’s policies. Any reimbursement Executive is entitled to receive will (a) be paid no later than forty-five (45) days after the date upon which the expense was submitted for reimbursement, (b) not be affected by any other expenses that are eligible for reimbursement in any tax year, and (c) not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.\n\n​\n\n7._Termination of Executive’s Employment_.\n\n​\n\n7.1 _Termination by the Company for Cause_. The Company may terminate Executive’s employment immediately at any time for Cause.

All other Company obligations to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will become automatically terminated and completely extinguished upon termination for Cause, and Executive will not be entitled to receive the Severance Benefits described in subsection 7.7 below.\n\n​\n\n7.2 _Termination by Executive for Good Reason_. Executive may terminate Executive’s employment for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean that Executive has complied with the Good Reason Process (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any of the following events without Executive’s written consent: (i) a material diminution in Executive’s responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a diminution in the Executive’s Base Salary or Target Annual Bonus Amount; or (iii) the material breach by the Company of any material provision of this Agreement or other written agreement between the Company and the Executive (each a “Good Reason Condition”). “Good Reason Process” shall mean that (i) Executive reasonably determines in good faith that a Good Reason Condition has occurred; (ii)\n\n​\n\n4\n\n​\n\nExecutive notifies the Company in writing of the occurrence of a Good Reason Condition within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of such condition (iii) Executive cooperates in good faith with the Company’s efforts, for a period not less than thirty (30) days following such notice (the “Cure Period”), to remedy the condition; (iv) notwithstanding such efforts, the Good Reason Condition continues to exist; and (v) Executive terminates his employment within thirty (30) days after the end of the Cure Period.

Furthermore, to the extent that Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of the Section 409A Regulations as of the date of Executive’s separation from service, no amount that constitutes a deferral of compensation which is payable on account of Executive’s separation from service will be paid to Executive before the date (“Delayed Payment Date”) which is first day of the seventh month after the date of Executive’s separation from service or, if earlier, the date of Executive’s death following such separation from service. All such amounts that would, but for this Section, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date.\n\n​\n\n9.2The Company intends that income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code. The provisions of this Agreement will be interpreted and construed in favor of satisfying any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code. **However, the Company does not guarantee any particular tax effect for income provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.** In any event, except for the Company’s responsibility to withhold applicable income and employment taxes from compensation paid or provided to Executive, the Company will not be responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes on compensation paid or provided to Executive pursuant to this Agreement.

During the Term, Executive agrees not to engage in any work, paid or unpaid, or other activities that create a conflict of interest. Such work and/or activities will include, but is not limited to, directly or indirectly competing with the Company in any way, or acting as an officer, director, employee, consultant, stockholder, volunteer, lender, or agent of any business enterprise of the same nature as, or which is in direct competition with, the business in which the Company is now engaged or in which the Company becomes engaged during the term of Executive’s employment with the Company, as may be reasonably determined by the Company. If the Company believes such a conflict exists during the term of this Agreement, the\n\n​\n\n7\n\n​\n\nCompany may ask Executive to, and Executive will, discontinue the other work and/or activities or resign employment with the Company.\n\n​\n\n11._Nondisclosure of Confidential Information_.\n\n​\n\n11.1Executive recognizes that the knowledge and information about, and relationships with business associates, customers, clients and agents of the Company and its affiliated companies, and the business methods, systems, plans, and policies of the Company and of its affiliated companies, which Executive may receive, obtain, or establish as an employee of the Company are valuable and unique assets of the Company or its affiliates. Executive agrees that, during any employment period and thereafter, except in the course of performing his duties under this Agreement, Executive will not disclose or remove, without the written consent of the Company, (i) any material or substantial, confidential, or proprietary know-how, data, or information, including, but not limited to software, data, information relating to customers and clients, pricing, training manuals, mandatory processes and means or techniques pertaining to the Company or its affiliates, (ii) any business plans, strategies, targets, or directives, to any person, firm, corporation, or any other entity, for any reason or purpose whatsoever and (iii) any other information deemed by the Company to be confidential, whether marked or otherwise labeled or identified as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). Executive acknowledges and agrees that all memoranda, notes, records, clients lists, client information and other documents, computer software, data or material or any other Confidential Information in any form made or compiled by Executive or made available to Executive concerning the Company’s business is and will be the Company’s exclusive property and will be delivered by Executive to the Company upon termination of Executive’s employment or at any other time upon the request of the Company.\n\n​\n\n11.2The restrictions in the above paragraph will not apply to: (1) information that at the time of disclosure is in the public domain through no fault of Executive’s; (2) information received from a third party outside of the Company that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; (3) information approved for release by written authorization of the Company; or (4) information that may be required by law or an order of any court, agency or proceeding to be disclosed. Executive will provide the Company notice of any such required disclosure once Executive has knowledge of it and will help the Company to the extent reasonable to obtain an appropriate protective order.\n\n​\n\n11.3The Company acknowledges that Executive has had significant prior work experience in the industry in which the Company is engaged, and that Executive enters into this Agreement with significant prior knowledge, information and relationships in such industry.\n\n​\n\n12._Company Covenants_. As a result of the relationship created further to this Agreement, upon the execution of this Agreement by both Parties, the Company agrees to, and will, place Executive in a position of special trust, and it will provide Executive with: (a) Confidential Information (which includes trade secrets) and access to such information; (b) specialized training, which may include self-study materials, on-line training, on the job training, and instruction as to Company’s products, services, business relationships, and methods of operation; and (c) goodwill support such as expense reimbursements in accordance with\n\n​\n\n8\n\n​\n\nCompany’s policies, Confidential Information related to Company’s current and prospective clients, customers, business associates, vendors, and suppliers, and contact and relationships with current and potential clients, customers, business associates, vendors, and suppliers to help Executive develop goodwill for the Company. The foregoing is not contingent on Executive’s continued employment for any length of time, but is contingent on Executive’s full compliance with the restrictions in Section 13.\n\n​\n\n13._Employee Covenants_. Executive specifically acknowledges that the items described in Section 12 will be items that Executive has not previously been given, and that Executive would not be given but for the execution of this Agreement. Executive agrees not to, directly or indirectly, participate in the unauthorized use, disclosure, or conversion of any Confidential Information. Specifically, but without limitation, Executive agrees not to use Confidential Information for Executive’s sole benefit, or for the benefit of any person or entity in any way that harms the Company or diminishes the value of the Confidential Information to the Company. Executive also agrees to use the specialized training, goodwill, and contacts developed with the Company’s customers/clients and contractors for the exclusive benefit of the Company, and Executive agrees not to use these items at any time in a way that would harm the business interests of the Company. However, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any government agency or entity, making other disclosures that are protected under whistleblower provisions of law, or receiving an award or monetary recovery pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s whistleblower program. Executive understands that Executive does not need prior authorization to make such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Company if Executive has made or will make any such report or disclosure.\n\n​\n\n13.1 _Goodwill with Customers_. Executive acknowledges that the Company has near permanent relationships with its customers and owns the goodwill in those relationships with customers that Executive will develop or maintain in the course and scope of Executive’s employment with the Company. If Executive owned goodwill in a relationship with a customer on the Effective Date, Executive hereby assigns any and all such goodwill to the Company, and the Company will become the owner of such goodwill.\n\n​\n\n13.2 _Covenant Not to Compete_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, while employed by the Company and during the twelve (12)-month period immediately following the termination of Executive’s employment with the Company, regardless of the reason for such termination (the “Restricted Period”), Executive will not, directly or indirectly, render services in the Restricted Territories (whether as owner, operator, member, shareholder, trustee, manager, consultant, strategic partner, employee, or otherwise) that are the same or substantially similar to the services Executive provided to the Company during the 12-month period preceding the end of Executive’s employment, to a Competing Business. For purposes hereof, a “Competing Business” means an entity that provides the same types of services, products, or other offerings as provided by the Company, and “Restricted Territories” means the State of Illinois and the State of New York.\n\n​\n\n13.3 _Non-solicitation of Customers_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in\n\n​\n\n9\n\n​\n\nSection 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Executive will not directly or indirectly solicit, cause to be solicited, assist, or otherwise be involved with the solicitation of, for or on behalf of a Competing Business, any persons or entities within the Restricted Territories who are known to Executive as a result of Executive’s employment with the Company, and who were customers or clients of the Company during the twelve (12)-month period preceding the end of Executive’s employment with the Company and about which Executive possesses or received Confidential Information or with whom Executive had substantial personal contact during the period of Executive’s employment.\n\n​\n\n13.4 _Non-solicitation of Employees and Contractors_. In consideration of Executive’s employment with the Company, as well as the Company’s covenants and promises set forth in Section 12 and elsewhere in this Agreement, Executive agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Executive will not solicit, encourage, or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or independent contractors of the Company, who are known to Executive as a result of his employment with the Company, to terminate their employment with the Company.\n\n​\n\n13.5 _Acknowledgment_. Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive’s services to be rendered to the Company are of a special and unique character, that Executive will obtain knowledge and skill relevant to the Company’s business, its methods, and its strategies by virtue of Executive’s employment, and that the restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions of this Agreement are reasonable and reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, including the Company’s trade secrets and other Confidential Information, and are ancillary to the enforceable promises between Executive and the Company in the other sections of this Agreement as well as Executive’s employment with the Company. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the observance of the covenants set forth herein will not cause Executive undue hardship nor will it unreasonably interfere with Executive’s ability to earn a livelihood either during or following Executive’s employment with the Company. Further, the Parties acknowledge that the foregoing restrictive covenants are essential elements of this Agreement, and that, but for Executive’s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n13.6 _Tolling_. Executive agrees that if Executive is deemed by a court or other tribunal to have violated any of the terms of the restrictive covenant obligations in this Section 13, the Restricted Period will be extended by one day for each day that Executive failed to comply with the restriction at issue and, further, the Non-Competition Consideration shall cease or be repaid by Executive for each month of such breach during the Restricted Period.\n\n​\n\n14.| _Enforcement; Remedies; Construction_.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n14.1Executive covenants, agrees, and recognizes the breach or threatened breach of the covenants, or any of them, contained in Sections 11, 12 and 13 will result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Company and that the Company will be entitled to an injunction restraining Executive or any of his affiliates from any violation of Sections 11, 12 and 13 to the fullest extent allowed by law. Executive further covenants and agrees that in the event of a violation of any of his respective covenants and agreements contained in Sections 11, 12 and 13 hereof, the Company will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent\n\n​\n\n10\n\n​\n\njurisdiction, without the requirement to post bond. Nothing herein will be construed as prohibiting the Company from pursuing any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available to it for any such breach or threatened breach, including but not limited to monetary damages.\n\n​\n\n14.2Executive hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees as follows:\n\n​\n\n(a)that he has read the covenants set forth above in Sections 11, 12 and 13, has had an opportunity to discuss them with an attorney and that such covenants are reasonable in all respects and are necessary to protect the legitimate business and competitive interests of the Company; and\n\n​\n\n(b)that each of the covenants set forth in Sections 11, 12 and 13 and the subdivisions thereof are separately and independently given, and each such covenant is intended to be enforceable separately and independently of the other such covenants, including, without limitation, enforcement by injunction without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security; provided, however, that the invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement in any respect will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement in any other respect. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction by reason of the geographic or business scope or the duration thereof or for any other reason, such invalidity or unenforceability will attach only to the particular aspect of such provision found invalid or unenforceable as applied and will not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement or the enforcement of such provision in other circumstances, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this Agreement will be construed as if the geographic or business scope or the duration of such provision or other basis on which such provision has been challenged had been more narrowly drafted so as not to be invalid or unenforceable.\n\n​\n\n14.3Nothing in Sections 10, 12 or 13 will prohibit Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) an owner of not more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation, any securities of which are publicly traded, so long as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.\n\n​\n\n15._D &O Insurance_. During the time period in which Executive is employed by the Company and for an appropriate period of time thereafter, the Company will: (a) maintain directors and officers liability insurance coverage which provides coverage to Executive (and the Company’s other officers and directors) in size and scope that is customary for a publicly-traded company in the Company’s business; and (b) provide to Executive, on an annual basis, a copy of the relevant insurance policy along with documentation evidencing that such coverage is in full force and effect.\n\n​\n\n16._General Provisions_.\n\n​\n\n16.1 _Successors and Assigns_. The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon the successors and assigns of\n\n​\n\n11\n\n​\n\nthe Company. Executive will not be entitled to assign any of Executive’s rights or obligations under this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n16.2 _Waiver_. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, or prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n16.3 _Attorneys’ Fees_. In the event of litigation between the Parties with respect to this Agreement or the interpretation or enforcement hereof, the non-prevailing party shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing party, in addition to such other damages as may be awarded.\n\n​\n\n16.4 _Severability_. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the Parties will receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such court, the unenforceable provision will be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected thereby.\n\n​\n\n16.5 _Interpretation; Construction_. The headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Agreement has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that Executive has had an opportunity to review and revise the Agreement and have it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n16.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware. Each Party consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the chancery, state or federal courts of Delaware, if applicable, in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\n\n​\n\n16.7 _Notices_. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered as follows with notice deemed given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier upon written verification of receipt; (c) by telecopy or facsimile transmission upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission; (d) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt; or (e) by email, which such notice will be deemed delivered and received upon sending. All notices will be addressed as follows:\n\n​\n\nEXECUTIVE:\n\nDavid Shane\n\n[***]\n\n[***]\n\n​\n\n​\n\n12\n\n​\n\nCOMPANY:\n\nBinah Capital Group, Inc.\n\n80 State Street\n\nAlbany, NY 12207\n\n​\n\nor at such changed addresses as either Party may designate in writing.\n\n​\n\n16.8 _Survival_. Sections 7.7 and 9 through 16 of this Agreement will survive Executive’s employment by Company.\n\n​\n\n16.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior or simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, and agreements, whether written or oral. This Agreement may be amended or modified only with the written consent of Executive and the CEO. No oral waiver, amendment or modification will be effective under any circumstances whatsoever.\n\n​\n\n[_Signatures appear on following page_]\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n[***] Indicates material that has been excluded from this Exhibit 10.2 because it is not material.\n\n​\n\n13\n\n​\n\nTHE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HAVE READ THE FOREGOING AGREEMENT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH AND EVERY PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN.
