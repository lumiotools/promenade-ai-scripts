We are working to expand our hemodialysis product portfolio and introduce new products to the market in 2025.\" \n\nRockwell Medical’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 will provide a full analysis of the Company’s business strategy as well as its third quarter of 2024 results. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nNet sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted solely of concentrates products sales. Net sales for the same periods in 2023 consisted of concentrates products sales and the recognition of $1.5 million of deferred license revenue related to the termination of the Baxter distribution agreement in the first quarter of 2023, and $2.2 million of deferred license revenue related to the termination of the Triferic (dialysate) distribution agreement with Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, in connection with the Wanbang agreement, Rockwell Medical reserved $1.1 million of long-term inventory for which the Company realized a net increase of $1.1 million in gross profit for the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the termination of the Wanbang development effort. \n\nThe following financial highlights are for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: \n\nNet Sales\n\n  * Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $28.3 million, the highest quarterly concentrates products sales generated to date for the Company. This represents a 19% increase over net sales of $23.8 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 31% over $21.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $6.7 million was driven by $4.5 million from a special large order of premium-priced products purchased by our largest customer, as well as $2.5 million of increased sales and price increases to existing customers. \n  * Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $76.8 million, which represents a 25% increase over net sales of $61.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net sales was primarily due to customers being added through the Evoqua Water Technologies asset acquisition, a special large order of premium-priced products purchased by our largest customer, as well as increased sales and price increases to existing customers. Excluding deferred revenue, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 33% over $57.7 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\nGross Profit\n\n  * Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.2 million, which represents a 183% increase over $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of deferred revenue recognition, gross profit for the three months increased 464% over $1.1 million for the same period in 2023 driven by a special large order of premium-priced products purchased by our largest customer, as well as increased sales and price increases to existing customers. \n  * Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $13.9 million, which represents a 137% increase over $5.8 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 342% over $3.1 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\nGross Margin\n\n  * Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 22%, which represents an increase from 9%, or 5% excluding deferred revenue, for the same period in 2023. The improvement in gross margin was largely driven by improved operational efficiencies, a special large order of premium-priced products purchased by our largest customer, as well as increased sales and price increases to existing customers. \n  * Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18%, which represents an increase from 9%, or 5% excluding deferred revenue, for the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\nNet Income\n\n  * Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.7 million compared to a net loss of $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, net income for the third quarter of 2024 represented a $4.6 million improvement over a net loss of $3.0 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.3 million, which represents an improvement of $7.2 million over a net loss of $6.9 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 improved by $9.9 million over net loss of $9.6 million the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.8 million compared with a negative adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million for the same period in 2023. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.8 million compared with a negative adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $9.7 million over the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale at September 30, 2024 increased to $18.3 million, which was driven by $4.3 million in cash flow from operations, compared to cash and cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale of $11.9 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**_(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts)_ ** |  **2024** |  **2023(a) ** |  **2024** |  **2023(a)(b) **  \n**Net Sales** |  $  |  28.3  |  $  |  23.8  |  $  |  76.8  |  $  |  61.5   \n**Gross Profit** |  6.2  |  2.2  |  13.9  |  5.8   \n**Operating Income (Loss)** |  1.9  |  (1.7  |  )  |  1.1  |  (6.1  |  )   \n**Net Income (Loss)** |  1.7  |  (1.9  |  )  |  0.3  |  (6.9  |  )   \n**Adjusted EBITDA(d) ** |  2.8  |  (1.2  |  )  |  3.8  |  (4.4  |  )   \n**Basic Net Income (Loss) per Share(c) ** |  $  |  0.05  |  $  |  (0.07  |  )  |  $  |  0.01  |  $  |  (0.32  |  )   \n**Adjusted EPS(d) ** |  $  |  0.09  |  $  |  (0.04  |  )  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  (0.21  |  )   \n  \n_(a)_ |  _Includes $1.5 million of deferred license revenue related to the termination of the Baxter distribution agreement in the first quarter of 2023._  \n---|---  \n_(b)_ |  _Includes $2.2 million of deferred revenue related to the termination of the Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. distribution agreement in the third quarter of 2023._  \n_(c)_ |  _See Note 3 for more details related to Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding on Form 10-Q filed November 12, 2024._  \n_(d)_ |  _See reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in the tables below._  \n  \n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, net product sales included a special large order of premium-priced products purchased by the Company's largest customer (the \"Customer\"). Additionally, Rockwell Medical received a Notice of Extension of Term (the \"Extension\") of the Amended and Restated Products Purchase Agreement (the \"Amended Agreement\"), dated September 21, 2023, which amended and restated the Products Purchase Agreement, dated July 1, 2019, with the Customer. The Extension extends the term of the Amended Agreement through December 31, 2025 (the \"Extension Term\"), during which Extension Term product pricing will increase under the terms of the Amended Agreement. The Customer has indicated to the Company that the Customer expects volumes to decline during the Extension Term as the Customer works to diversify its supplier base. Rockwell Medical is working with the Customer to focus volume reductions on products that the Company believes are least profitable for Rockwell Medical. Currently, the Company believes that the Customer's net sales in 2025 will decline between approximately $31 million and $38 million. The Customer is required to provide Rockwell Medical with a binding twelve-month forecast on or before December 15, 2024, at which time the Company will be able to determine the actual impact on net sales in 2025. Under the terms of the Amended Agreement, the Customer is committed to purchasing at least the amount provided in the binding forecast. The profit margin associated with the Customer's product purchases has historically ranged between a gross loss to a single-digit gross margin, excluding the special large order of premium-priced products purchased by the Customer. The Company is working to make up this projected revenue gap with new, higher margin customer contracts, product purchase agreements, distribution agreements, standard price increases, and hemodialysis product opportunities that would diversify the Company's portfolio of offerings — several of which are already in late-stage contract negotiations. Despite the expected year-over-year decline in revenue from the Customer, Rockwell Medical believes that the Company will be profitable in 2025 on an Adjusted EBITDA basis. \n  * Rockwell Medical [entered into a multi-million dollar distribution agreement with Nipro Medical Corporation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.rockwellmed.com%2Fpress-releases%2Fnews-details%2F2024%2FRockwell-Medical-Enters-into-Multi-Million-Dollar-Distribution-Agreement-with-Nipro-Medical-Corporation%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150986&newsitemid=20241112007562&lan=en-US&anchor=entered+into+a+multi-million+dollar+distribution+agreement+with+Nipro+Medical+Corporation&index=2&md5=9bfd85c60947dd9d531da7680d88709e).

The Company has provided a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of this press release. In addition, the Company has excluded deferred revenue from the three-month and nine-month calculations of net sales, gross profit, gross margin and net loss. Each of these adjusted measures is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company has provided reconciliations to the GAAP measures at the end of this press release. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by Rockwell Medical to understand and evaluate operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. The Company provides Adjusted EBITDA because it believes the metric is helpful in highlighting trends in its operating results because it excludes items that are not indicative of Rockwell Medical’s core operating performance. In particular, the Company believes that the exclusion of the items eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of Rockwell Medical’s business. Adjusted net sales, gross profit, gross margin and net loss is used by Rockwell Medical to understand growth within its hemodialysis concentrates business by excluding a one-time item that is not indicative of its core operating performance. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA and net sales, gross profit, gross margin, net income, and net loss should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the same industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net sales, gross profit, gross margin and net loss as tools for comparison. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating the Company’s performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net sales, gross profit, gross margin and net loss alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and other GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is our best proxy for cash burn. Adjusted net sales, gross profit, gross margin and net loss enable us to understand growth within our hemodialysis concentrates business by excluding a one-time item that is not indicative of our core operating performance. \n\n**ABOUT ROCKWELL MEDICAL**\n\nRockwell Medical, Inc.

Additionally, Rockwell Medical received a\nNotice of Extension of Term (the \"Extension\") of the Amended and Restated Products Purchase Agreement\n(the \"Amended Agreement\"), dated September 21, 2023, which amended and restated the Products Purchase\nAgreement, dated July 1, 2019, with the Customer. The Extension extends the term of the Amended\nAgreement through December 31, 2025 (the \"Extension Term\"), during which Extension Term product pricing\nwill increase under the terms of the Amended Agreement. The Customer has indicated to the Company that\nthe Customer expects volumes to decline during the Extension Term as the Customer works to diversify its\nsupplier base. Rockwell Medical is working with the Customer to focus volume reductions on products that\nthe Company believes are least pro\u0000table for Rockwell Medical. Currently, the Company believes that the\nCustomer's net sales in 2025 will decline between approximately $31 million and $38 million. The Customer is\nrequired to provide Rockwell Medical with a binding twelve-month forecast on or before December 15, 2024,\nat which time the Company will be able to determine the actual impact on net sales in 2025. Under the terms\nof the Amended Agreement, the Customer is committed to purchasing at least the amount provided in the\nbinding forecast. The pro\u0000t margin associated with the Customer's product purchases has historically ranged\nbetween a gross loss to a single-digit gross margin, excluding the special large order of premium-priced\nproducts purchased by the Customer. The Company is working to make up this projected revenue gap with\nnew, higher margin customer contracts, product purchase agreements, distribution agreements, standard\nprice increases, and hemodialysis product opportunities that would diversify the Company's portfolio of\no\u0000erings — several of which are already in late-stage contract negotiations. Despite the expected year-over-\nyear decline in revenue from the Customer, Rockwell Medical believes that the Company will be pro\u0000table in\n4\n2025 on an Adjusted EBITDA basis.\nRockwell Medical entered into a multi-million dollar distribution agreement with Nipro Medical\nCorporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell Medical will continue to supply Nipro with the\nCompany's liquid and dry acid and bicarbonate hemodialysis concentrates, as well as its dry acid concentrates\nmixer, for which Nipro has the right to distribute the Company's products globally, excluding the United\nStates. The agreement will remain in e\u0000ect for two years with the option to extend the agreement for an\nadditional one-year period and includes product purchasing minimums of $5.0 million for the \u0000rst year and\nincremental increases each subsequent year.\nRockwell Medical announced a product purchase agreement with a leading at-home and acute care dialysis\nmanufacturer in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell Medical will supply this\ncustomer with the Company's liquid acid RenalPure ® and liquid bicarbonate SteriLyte ® , both of which will\nbe packaged in either the Company's four-per-case packaging for larger dialysis settings or the Company's\ntwo-per-case convenience pack for smaller acute care and at-home care settings.\nRockwell Medical renewed its supply agreement with aQua Dialysis. As part of the renewal, the Company\nexpanded the distribution of its liquid and dry acid and bicarbonate hemodialysis concentrates and other\nassociated products o\u0000ered by Rockwell Medical to all of aQua Dialysis' Texas-based clinics.\nRockwell Medical was named a 2024 Fortune Best Workplaces in Manufacturing and Production TM List .\nGUIDANCE\nRockwell Medical is increasing its 2024 guidance projections as follows:\nUpdated Updated Updated Original\n2024 Guidance 2024 Guidance 2024 Guidance 2024 Guidance\n(As of November 12, (As of August 8, 2024) (As of May 14, 2024) (As of March 21, 2024)\n2024)\nNet (Product) $98.0M to $101.0M $95.0M to $98.0M $90.0M to $94.0M $84.0M to $88.0M\nSales\nGross Pro\u0000t $15.0M to $17.0M $14.0M to $16.0M $13.0M to $15.0M $12.0M to $14.0M\nGross Margin 16% to 18% 14% to 17% 14% to 16% 14% to 16%\nAdjusted EBITDA $4.0M to $5.0M $0.75M to $1.5M $0.5M to $1.0M $0M to $0.5M\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST DETAILS\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024\nTime: 8:00am ET\nLive Number: (888) 660-6347 // (International) 1 (929) 201-6594\nConference Call ID: 4944610\n5\nWebcast and Replay: www.RockwellMed.com/Results\nSpeakers:\nMark Strobeck, Ph.D. — President and Chief Executive O\u0000cer; and\nJesse Neri — SVP, Finance.\nFormat: Discussion of third quarter 2024 \u0000nancial and operational results followed by Q&A.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement Rockwell Medical’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the United States of America (“GAAP”), this press release also includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, a\nnon-GAAP \u0000nancial measure that is de\u0000ned as net income (loss) before net interest income (expense), net other\nincome (expense), income tax expenses (bene\u0000t), depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, stock-based\ncompensation expense, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of\nour business, including but not limited to one-time severance costs, deferred revenue and inventory reserve\namounts, if applicable for the periods presented. The Company has provided a reconciliation of net loss, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of this press release. In addition, the\nCompany has excluded deferred revenue from the three-month and nine-month calculations of net sales, gross\npro\u0000t, gross margin and net loss. Each of these adjusted measures is a non-GAAP \u0000nancial measure. The Company\nhas provided reconciliations to the GAAP measures at the end of this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by Rockwell Medical to understand and evaluate operating performance\nand trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. The\nCompany provides Adjusted EBITDA because it believes the metric is helpful in highlighting trends in its operating\nresults because it excludes items that are not indicative of Rockwell Medical’s core operating performance. In\nparticular, the Company believes that the exclusion of the items eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides\nuseful measures for period-to-period comparisons of Rockwell Medical’s business. Adjusted net sales, gross pro\u0000t,\ngross margin and net loss is used by Rockwell Medical to understand growth within its hemodialysis concentrates\nbusiness by excluding a one-time item that is not indicative of its core operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and net sales, gross pro\u0000t, gross margin, net income, and net loss should not be considered in\nisolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including\ncompanies in the same industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures di\u0000erently or may use\nother measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and\nadjusted net sales, gross pro\u0000t, gross margin and net loss as tools for comparison. There are a number of\n6\nlimitations related to the use of these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures rather than the most directly comparable\n\u0000nancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating the Company’s performance, you should\nconsider Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net sales, gross pro\u0000t, gross margin and net loss alongside other \u0000nancial\nperformance measures, including net loss and other GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is our best proxy for cash burn.\nAdjusted net sales, gross pro\u0000t, gross margin and net loss enable us to understand growth within our hemodialysis\nconcentrates business by excluding a one-time item that is not indicative of our core operating performance.\nABOUT ROCKWELL MEDICAL\nRockwell Medical, Inc.

Hunter\nSenior VP & Chief Corporate Affairs Officer\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for this update on Rockwell Medical. Joining me on today's\nconference call are Dr. Mark Strobeck, Rockwell Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jesse\nNeri, Rockwell Medical's Senior Vice President of Finance.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking\nstatements about Rockwell Medical within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not\nlimited to, the types of statements identified forward-looking in our annual report on Form 10-K and our\nsubsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC.

Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our\nopinions and expectations only as of today. Except as required by law, we specifically disclaim any\nobligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future\nevents.\nFactors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in or implied\nby such forward-looking statements are discussed in greater detail in our periodic reports filed with\nthe SEC. Rockwell Medical's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2024 provides a full\nanalysis of the company's business strategy as well as the company's financial and operational results for\nthe 3 and 9 months ended [ September 2024 ].

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Rockwell Medical's Third\nQuarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. First, I'm going to review our third quarter results\nthen provide you with a preview of what we expect in the fourth quarter and then our outlook on 2025.\nWe are pleased to share with you that for a second consecutive quarter, we achieved profitability on a cash\nflow and adjusted EBITDA basis. Additionally, for the third quarter 2024, we achieved the highest quarterly\nconcentrate product sales, the highest quarterly gross profit and the highest quarterly gross margin in\nRockwell's history.\nRevenue for the third quarter was positively impacted by consistent sales from our current customers as\nwell as our largest customer making a special large order of premium-priced products during the quarter.\nOur largest customer is expected to continue to make those purchases into the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe increase in gross profit was due to higher gross margin on our current business, coupled with the\nspecial large order of premium-priced products from our largest customer. This, in turn, led to an increase\nin our gross margin for the third quarter and profitability on the cash flow and adjusted EBITDA basis.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nAs a result of the third quarter of 2024 being our second consecutive quarter of positive cash flow, we\nare now eligible to extend the interest-only period of our loan and security agreement with Innovatus\nfrom 30 months which has an amortization date of August 1, 2026. August 1, 2026, the 36 months, which\nhas an amortization date of February 1, 2027. We intend to take advantage of this extension. During the\nthird quarter of 2024, we entered into a multimillion dollar distribution agreement with Nipro Medical\nCorporation.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we will continue to supply Nipro with our liquid and dry acid and\nbicarbonate hemodialysis concentrates for which Nipro has the right to distribute our products outside\nof the United States. The 2-year agreement has an option to extend for an additional 1-year period and\nincludes product purchasing minimums of $5 million for the first year and incremental increases each\nsubsequent year.\nAs we noted in our last earnings call, we expanded our concentrates product portfolio to include\na convenience back that will help Rockwell Medical expand our presence in the at-home market.\nSubsequently, we announced a product purchase agreement with a leading at-home and acute care\ndialysis equipment manufacturer in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, we will supply\nthis customer with our liquid assets and liquid bicarbonate, both of which will be packaged in either our 4\nper case packaging or larger dialysis settings or 2 per case packaging for smaller acute care and at-home\nsettings. Rockwell Medical also renewed its supply agreement with aQua Dialysis.\nAs part of the renewal, we expanded our distribution to all Texas-based aQua Dialysis clinic, supplying\nthem with our liquid and dry acid and bicarbonate hemodialysis concentrates and other associated\nhemodialysis products.\nNow turning our attention to the fourth quarter of 2024. We project that our revenue will be between\n$23 million and $25 million. Our gross margin will be in line with previous quarters, and we will be\nprofitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis. As a result, we have increased our 2024 guidance for net sales to\nbetween $98 million and $101 million, gross profit to between $15 million and $17 million; gross margin\nto between 16% and 18% and adjusted EBITDA to between $4 million and $5 million. These targets\nrepresent significant improvement over what we initially guided at the beginning of this year.\nIn addition, we have significantly bolstered our cash position more than doubling it from where our\ncash position was at the end of the first quarter 2024. These accomplishments and revised projections\nare a direct result of our team's hard work and dedication to deliver against the goals and objectives\nwe [indiscernible] over 2 years ago which include focusing on growing Rockwell's revenue-generating\nbusiness, driving profitability for our overall business and achieving profitability in 2024.\nContinually assessing our strategic priorities and capital structure, managing cash, reducing our debt\nand placing Rockwell Medical on firmer, stronger, more stable financial footing. Every member of our\norganization has been instrumental in turning Rockwell Medical around helping to rebuild shareholder\nvalue and, in turn, positively impacting more patients with end-stage kidney disease. 2024 will reflect the\nbest performance this company has had in 25-plus years of its history.\nAs we look towards 2025, we expect to encounter a shift in our customer makeup as we move away from\nless profitable business to focus on more profitable growth opportunities. The first of these changes will\ncome from the relationship with our largest customer. During the third quarter, we received confirmation\nthat our largest customer will extend their product purchase agreement with Rockwell through the end\nof 2025, during which product pricing will be increased. This customer has indicated to us that it expects\nvolumes to decline during this extended period as they work to diversify their supplier base. We are\nactively working with this customer in an effort to focus their volume reduction on products that we\nbelieve are least profitable for Rockwell.\nCurrently, we believe that our largest customers net sales in 2025 will decline between $31 million\nand $38 million, depending on the final volume forecast for 2025, which we expect to receive on or by\nDecember 15. Although our top line revenue will be negatively impacted in the short term, we believe we\nwill [indiscernible] EBITDA basis in 2025. And this is before any new customer contracts, product purchase\nagreements, distribution agreements, new product opportunities or potential acquisitions are put in place.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nWhile this revised forecast downward is certainly disappointing, we have always known that we have a\nsignificant portion of our revenue with a single customer, which presented a risk to Rockwell. We have\nbeen working incredibly hard to mitigate that risk by adding new customers and growing our top line\nbeyond our largest customer. We are working to replace this top line revenue with opportunities that we\nbelieve will be more profitable to Rockwell in 2025 and beyond.\nLet me walk you through some of the activities we are currently pursuing. We are in the process of\nnegotiating a large multiyear supply agreement with the world's largest leading provider of dialysis\nproducts and services and hope to be able to announce the execution of this agreement later this month.\nWe are in the final stages of contract negotiations to add 2 new complementary hemodialysis products to\nour portfolio in 2025. We have new customer contracts under review that we expect to announce shortly.\nFinally, we have several acquisition opportunities we are currently evaluating that would add new\ncapabilities and products to our portfolio. Because of all the changes we have made here at Rockwell over\nthe last 2-plus years, the change in our largest customer's forecast, while a short-term setback doesn't\nimpact the strong foundation that we've built. We have a number of exciting opportunities we are working\non that we believe will continue to support a profitable growing business going forward.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jesse to go into further detail about our third quarter financial results.\nJesse Neri\nSenior Vice President of Finance\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. For the 3 and 9 months ended September 30, 2024,\nI will present the financials for the comparable periods in 2023 with and without the deferred revenue\nrecognition in Q1 and Q3 of 2023 related to the termination of the Baxter and Wanbang distribution\nagreements, respectively. This continues to offer us the opportunity to more accurately present the\nprogress we have made and continue to make, specifically within our hemodialysis concentrates segment.\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $28.3 million, our highest quarterly concentrate product\nrevenue to date. This represents a 19% increase over net sales of $23.8 million from the same period\nin 2023. Excluding deferred revenue, net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased 31% over $21.6\nmillion for the third quarter 2023. This increase was driven by a large special order of premium-priced\nproducts by our largest customer. Net sales for the 9 months ended September 30, 2024, were $76.8\nmillion. Excluding deferred revenue, this represents a 33% increase over the same period in 2023.\nGross profit for Q3 2024 was $6.2 million, which represents a 183% increase over gross profit of $2.2\nmillion for the same period in 2023. Excluding the impact of deferred revenue recognition, gross profit\nfor the third quarter increased 464% over $1.1 million for the same period in 2023, driven by a special\norder -- special large order of premium-priced products by our largest customer as well as increased sales\nand price increases to existing customers.

Operator, please open the phone lines for any questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.\nAnthony V. Vendetti\nMaxim Group LLC, Research Division\nMark, I was just wondering if -- obviously, with this customer indicating a decrease in orders for 2025,\nyou have plenty of time to prepare for that. At-home dialysis is on an uptick. Can some of that be made\nup from more orders for at-home dialysis concentrate? And then where else are you looking to diversify\nwithin your core customer base? Does that open up more opportunity? Or are you in the process of\nidentifying new customers to take on this additional -- now that you have additional supply capabilities?\nMark Strobeck\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. Thanks, Anthony, for the question. To address your first point, absolutely. I think we continue to see\nand continue to believe that the at-home dialysis market is expanding and we are working with all of the\nproviders, essentially that tap into that emerging sort of treatment path. So I think there's absolutely\nan opportunity for us to continue to grow within that as that market expands with our products. And\nthe convenience pack, which we've just recently introduced is -- it may seem like a small change to our\nexisting portfolio, but is incredibly meaningful when you think about what a patient at-home has to do\nto not only store the materials to carry out the dialysis process, but then what they physically have to\nmanage as far as lifting materials and putting it into the machine. So it may seem like a small change, but\nit's actually going to be quite meaningful and has been quite meaningful for the at-home market.\nSo I think absolutely, that's an area for us to grow. As I said, this change is something that I think for\nus, we always knew what the possibility. And so we wanted to prepare ourselves for that. The first place,\nobviously, is an expansion of the relationship with the largest dialysis provider on the planet in an effort\nto support making up that revenue change. Secondly, for us, we have an incredibly stable foundational\nbusiness that we're now looking to expand beyond just concentrates. Product opportunities, I think, are\ngoing to be key for us in 2025 to continually help build that gap with a higher margin-based opportunity.\nIt doesn't help us to continue to essentially supply product to a very large organization, of which we don't\nmake very much money on.\nAnd I think the point I was making was that even when you take away that top line, this business stays\nprofitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis, which gives you a sense that it's not really contributing much to\nthe margin that we see here. So for us, it's all about adding more things, developing more of our core\nbusiness in a much more profitable fashion. And that's where our goals and objectives are going to be\nthrough 2025. As I said, we recognize that this is going to have a short-term impact at least on the top\nline. But we're excited and the team is excited about the opportunities that we're pursuing that we hope to\nbe able to announce here in the next couple of weeks.\nAnthony V. Vendetti\nMaxim Group LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up to that, in terms of the impact, obviously, you've quantified the\nrevenue impact and it will have less of an impact because of the lower margin component of it on your\nEBITDA. Have you been able to? Or are you still working on what that impact will be to the EBITDA line\nin terms of either dollars or to the EBITDA margin? Any color around that? And then based on the lower\nrevenue footprint, is there any costs that you're able to take out temporarily as you look to either add new\nproducts or new innovation to your current product mix?\nMark Strobeck\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 12, 2024\nYes. No, thanks, Anthony. So yes, let me address each piece of that. Right now, we've taken a very\nconservative look at the business. And as I said, all of the numbers that we put forward really don't\ninclude or incorporate any new items that we're in the process of closing right now. So with that\nconservative look, we believe gross margin percentage for the business will continue to tick upwards as we\ngo forward into 2025. We're continuing that positive trend, a, through the efficiencies that we're creating\nhere in the organization; and two, obviously, removing products that are currently a drag on that gross\nmargin. So from gross margin percentage, we expect that to continue to increase.\nWe are working on what the final sort of impact will be on our EBITDA for next year. But as of right now,\nall of our modeling is continuing to indicate that the business is going to be profitable. We just don't know\nyet how profitable and that may come from some tweaks that we make from a cost perspective in our\nunderlying infrastructure. We will obviously, as we've done in the past, put out 2025 guidance at the\nbeginning of the year, that will very clearly indicate what that is. But I can tell you, from our perspective,\nwe will be a profitable entity on an adjusted EBITDA basis going forward.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Ram Selvaraju with H.C. Wainwright.\nUnknown Analyst\nThis is Jade for Ram. And congrats on the earnings. So could you tell me how the Western expansion is\ngoing and when you expect to fully deploy in the territory?\nMark Strobeck\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. So on a practical level, we've continued to increase the number of customers that we have in the\nWest and are continuing to enhance our presence there. We are in discussions right now with a potential\nopportunity that could provide us with a permanent position in the West. And we hope to be able to say\nmore about that in the coming weeks.\nUnknown Analyst\nGreat. And a follow-up to that more locationally based. So you've mentioned a lot as we move into\n2025 that you're planning that you can't really see anything, but is there anything that you can mention\nregarding value-driving developments in ex-U.S. territories during 2025?\nMark Strobeck\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. So that, too, is an area that continues to be a good opportunity for us, as you note from the press\nrelease. We signed this quarter an extension and enhancement of our relationship with Nipro Medical,\nwhich helps put our products into the international market. In addition, we are also in the final stages of\nbidding on multiple contracts in different international locations and seeking those tenders for product,\nwhich, again, we feel like we're in a really good position to do based on our existing international business.\nAnd so again, we hope to have more to say about that here in the coming weeks.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Dr. Strobeck.\nMark Strobeck\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you. Before we close, I'd like to take a moment to thank our team members for all their hard\nwork they do every day to provide dialysis clinics and the patients they serve with the highest quality\nproducts supported by the best customer service in the industry. Our team members at every level within\nour organization are the nucleus of our success. We have developed and continue to build upon a core\nexpertise in manufacturing and delivering hemodialysis concentrates. It's because of this dedication and\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC.

When patient outcomes\nare critical, customers and in turn, patients can depend on Rockwell Medical to deliver. We continue to\nfocus on optimization, automation and streamlining our operations to drive sustainable profitability and\nshareholder value.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n1. Description of Business\nRockwell Medical, Inc. (the \"Company\", \"Rockwell\", \"we\", or \"us\") is a healthcare company that develops, manufactures, commercializes, and distributes a\nportfolio of hemodialysis products for dialysis providers worldwide.\nRockwell is the largest supplier of liquid bicarbonate concentrates and the second largest supplier of acid and dry bicarbonate concentrates for dialysis\npatients in the United States. Hemodialysis is the most common form of end-stage kidney disease treatment and is usually performed at freestanding outpatient dialysis\ncenters, at hospital-based outpatient centers, at skilled nursing facilities, or in a patient’s home.\nRockwell manufactures hemodialysis concentrates at its facilities in Michigan, South Carolina, and Texas totaling approximately 175,000 square feet, and\nmanufactures its dry acid concentrate mixers at its facility in Iowa. Additionally, in July 2023, the Company purchased customer relationships, equipment and\ninventory from Evoqua Water Technologies LLC (\"Evoqua\") related to the manufacturing and sale of hemodialysis concentrates products, all of which are\nmanufactured under a contract manufacturing agreement with a third-party organization in Minnesota.\nRockwell delivers the majority of its hemodialysis concentrates products and mixers to dialysis clinics throughout the United States and internationally\nutilizing its own delivery trucks and third-party carriers.\nThe Company operates in a single segment.\nRockwell was incorporated in the state of Michigan in 1996 and re-domiciled to the state of Delaware in 2019. Rockwell's headquarters is located at 30142\nWixom Road, Wixom, Michigan 48393.\n2. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, Rockwell had approximately $18.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale, and working capital of\n$20.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $3.3 million. Based on the currently\navailable working capital along with the expectation of management of its ability to execute on its operational plans as discussed below, management believes the\nCompany currently has sufficient funds to meet its operating requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of the filing of this report.\nThe Company continues to review its operational plans and execute on the acquisition of new customers, and has implemented cost containment activities.\nThe Company may require additional capital to sustain its operations and make the investments it needs to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, the Company's\noperational plans include raising capital, if needed, by using the remaining $4.5 million available under its at-the-market (\"ATM\") facility or other methods or forms of\nfinancings, subject to existing limitations. If the Company attempts to obtain additional debt or equity financing, the Company cannot assume such financing will be\navailable on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe Company is subject to certain covenants and cure provisions under its Loan Agreement with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP (\"Innovatus\"),\nwhich, on January 2, 2024, was amended to include, among other things, an interest-only period for 30 months, or up to 36 months if certain conditions are met, and to\nextend the maturity date to January 1, 2029 (See Note 15 for further detail). As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all covenants.\nIn addition, the global macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased U.S. trade tariffs and\ntrade disputes with other countries, instability in the global capital and credit markets, recent bank failures in the United States, supply chain weaknesses, and\ninstability in the geopolitical environment, including as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East conflict and other political tensions, and the\noccurrence of natural disasters and public health crises. Such challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, recession fears, rising interest rates, foreign exchange\nvolatility and inflationary pressures. At this time, the Company is unable to quantify the potential effects, if any, of this economic and political instability on its future\noperations.\nRockwell has utilized a range of financing methods to fund its operations in the past; however, current conditions in the financial and credit markets may limit\nthe availability of funding or refinancing or increase the cost of funding. Due to the\nrapidly evolving nature of the global situation, it is not possible to predict the extent to which these conditions could adversely affect the Company's liquidity and\ncapital resources in the future.\n3. Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the U.\nS. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and on the same basis as the Company prepares its annual audited consolidated financial statements.\nThe condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),\nchanges in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited, but include all adjustments,\nconsisting of normal recurring adjustments the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results, and cash flows for the\nperiods presented. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 or for any future interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial\nstatements; however, it does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. The Company’s consolidated\nsubsidiaries consist of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Rockwell Transportation, Inc. and Rockwell Medical India Private Limited.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet Income (Loss) $ 1,664 $ (1,872) $ 276 $ (6,927)\nLess: Undistributed Earnings to Participating Securities (233) — (40) —\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 1,431 $ (1,872) $ 236 $ (6,927)\nDenominator:\nBasic Weighted Average Number of Shares of Common Stock Outstanding 31,551,805 27,521,088 30,447,588 21,526,978\nIncremental Shares Attributable to the Assumed Exercise of Outstanding Options to\nPurchase Common Stock 489,193 — 271,382 —\nIncremental Shares Attributable to the Assumed Vesting of Unvested Restricted\nStock Units 318,046 — 282,340 —\nIncremental Shares Attributable to the Assumed Exercise of Warrants 61,124 — 12,154 —\nDiluted Weighted Average Number of Shares of Common Stock Outstanding 32,420,168 27,521,088 31,013,464 21,526,978\nBasic Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 0.05 $ (0.07) $ 0.01 $ (0.32)\nDiluted Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 0.04 $ (0.07) $ 0.01 $ (0.32)\nBasic income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to the potential dilution that could\noccur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, using the more dilutive of the two- class method and the\nif-converted method in the period of earnings. The two class method is an earnings allocation method that determines income (loss) per share (when there are earnings)\nfor common stock and participating securities. The if-converted method assumes all convertible securities are converted into common stock. Diluted EPS excludes all\ndilutive potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nThe Company’s potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock awards and units, convertible preferred stock and warrants. The following\ntable includes the potential shares of common stock that were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS per share attributable to common stockholders for the\nperiods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock 3,793,388 4,045,278 3,793,388 4,045,278\nOptions to Purchase Common Stock 268,978 1,367,493 284,296 1,367,493\nConvertible Preferred Stock — 1,363,636 — 1,363,636\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units — 287,400 — 287,400\nUnvested Restricted Stock Awards 891 891 891 891\nTotal 4,063,257 7,064,698 4,078,575 7,064,698\nAdoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined a new accounting pronouncement\naffects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a review to determine the consequences of the change to its consolidated financial statements and\nassures there are sufficient controls in place to ascertain the Company’s consolidated financial statements properly reflect the change.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, Segment Reporting -\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of\ndetermining the effect this ASU will have on the disclosures contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which updates income tax disclosures primarily related to the\nrate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This ASU also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The\namendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is in the process of determining the effect this ASU will have on the disclosures contained in the notes to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASC 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which is intended to provide more detailed information about specified categories of expenses (purchases of\ninventory, employee compensation, depreciation and amortization) included in certain expense captions presented on the consolidated statement of operations. This\nnew standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early\nadoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for periods after the effective date of this ASU or (2)\nretrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on the\nconsolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.\n4. Asset Acquisition\nOn July 10, 2023, the Company executed and consummated the transactions contemplated by an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with\nEvoqua (the \"Evoqua Acquisition\"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the transaction (the “Closing”), the Company\npurchased customer relationships, equipment and inventory from Evoqua, which were related to its manufacturing and selling of hemodialysis concentrates products,\nall of which are manufactured under a contract manufacturing agreement with a third-party organization.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, total consideration was $17.4 million, comprising a cash payment at Closing of $12.4 million (inclusive of transaction\ncosts) and two $2.5 million deferred payments. On July 12, 2024, the Company and Evoqua executed an amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the \"First\nAmendment\"), which stipulated that the first deferred payment would be partially offset by $0.3 million to reimburse the Company for certain expenses incurred\nfollowing the close of the Evoqua Acquisition and split the first deferred payment into four quarterly installments to be paid through April 2025. The First Amendment\nalso split the second deferred payment into four quarterly installments to be paid from July 2025 through April 2026. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company paid the first installment of the first deferred payment of $0.6 million. The remaining installments due within the next twelve\nmonths are included as Deferred Consideration - Current on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business as defined by Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations.\n9\nROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe purchase price was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the assets acquired at the July 10, 2023 acquisition date as follows (table in thousands):\nConsideration\nCash Payment $ 12,233\nDeferred Consideration 5,000\nTransaction Costs 128\nTotal Consideration $ 17,361\nAssets Acquired\nCustomer Relationships Intangible Asset $ 11,035\nEquipment 5,093\nInventory 1,233\nTotal Assets Acquired $ 17,361\nThe fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach,\nwhich incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from the customer base. Key assumptions included discounted cash flow, estimated life cycle and\ncustomer attrition rates. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of 20 years. Given that the acquired equipment had been recently purchased and\nrecorded at fair value, the Company determined the fair value of the equipment using a cost approach, which considered assumptions over the equipment's current\nreplacement cost and useful life. Inventory was purchased directly from the contract manufacturer holding the inventory, which approximated fair value.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded amortization of its customer relationship intangible asset of $0.1 million\nand $0.4 million, respectively, resulting in a net intangible asset of $10.3 million as of September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, the Company recorded amortization of its customer relationship intangible asset of $0.1 million.\nEstimated future amortization expense on the Company's customer relationships intangible asset as of September 30, 2024 is as follows (table in thousands):\nYear ending December 31:\n2024 (remainder of year) $ 138\n2025 552\n2026 552\n2027 552\n2028 552\nThereafter 7,999\nTotal $ 10,345\n5. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued by the FASB. The core principle of the revenue standard\nis that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\ncompany expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n• Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer\n• Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n• Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by\nRockwell from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight related to contracts with customers are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in\ncost of sales when control of the goods transfers to the customer.\nNature of goods and services\nRockwell operates in one market segment, the hemodialysis market, which involves the manufacture, sale and distribution of hemodialysis products to\nhemodialysis clinics, including pharmaceutical, dialysis concentrates, dialysis kits and other ancillary products used in the dialysis process.\nRockwell's customer mix is diverse, with most customer sales concentrations under 10% and one customer, DaVita, Inc. (\"DaVita\"), at approximately 52%\nand 50% of total net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 47% and 50% of total net product sales for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rockwell's accounts receivable from this customer were approximately 40% of the total net consolidated\naccounts receivable balance at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See below and Note 10 for additional information regarding the Company's\ncontracts with DaVita.\nProduct Sales\nThe Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e., if a product or service is separately identifiable from other\nitems and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). The consideration, including any discounts, is\nallocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the cost plus margin\napproach.\nDrug and dialysis concentrate products are sold directly to dialysis clinics and to wholesale distributors in both domestic and international markets.\nDistribution and license agreements for which upfront fees are received are evaluated upon execution or modification of the agreement to determine if the agreement\ncreates a separate performance obligation from the underlying product sales. For all existing distribution and license agreements, the distribution and license\nagreement is not a distinct performance obligation from the product sales. In instances where regulatory approval of the product has not been established and the\nCompany does not have sufficient experience with the foreign regulatory body to conclude that regulatory approval is probable, the revenue for the performance\nobligation is recognized over the term of the license agreement (over time recognition). Conversely, when regulatory approval already exists or is probable, revenue is\nrecognized at the point in time that control of the product transfers to the customer.\nFor the majority of the Company's international customers, the Company recognizes revenue at the shipping point, which is generally the Company's plant or\nwarehouse. For other business, the Company recognizes revenue based on when the customer takes control of the product. The amount of revenue recognized is based\non the purchase order less returns and adjusted for any rebates, discounts, chargebacks or other amounts paid to customers estimated at the time of sale. Customers\ntypically pay for the product based on customary business practices with payment terms averaging 30 days, while a small subset of customers have payment terms\naveraging 60 days.\nDeferred License Revenue\nThe Company received upfront fees under five distribution and license agreements that have been deferred as a contract liability and presented on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as deferred license revenue. The amounts received from Wanbang Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Wanbang”),\nSun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Sun Pharma\"), Jeil Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\"Jeil Pharma\") and Drogsan Pharmaceuticals (\"Drogsan Pharma\") are recognized as\nrevenue over the estimated term of the applicable distribution and license agreement as regulatory approval was not received and the Company did not have sufficient\nexperience in China, India, South Korea and Turkey, respectively, to determine that regulatory approval was probable as of the execution of the agreement. The\namounts received from Baxter Healthcare Corporation (“Baxter”) were deferred and recognized as revenue at the point in time the estimated product sales under the\nagreement occurred. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, all remaining deferred revenue relating to the Wanbang and Baxter agreements was recognized as revenue.

Under the Amended Agreement, the Company and DaVita agreed to an increase in product pricing,\neffective September 1, 2023 and a one-time payment of $0.4 million to Rockwell on or after December 1, 2023, which was recorded as revenue recognized during the\nfourth quarter of 2023. The term of the Amended Agreement will expire on December 31, 2024. While the Company received written notice from DaVita in September\n2024 that notified the Company that DaVita extends the term of the Amended Agreement through December 31, 2025 (\"Extension Term\"), there can be no assurance\nof any further extensions. Product pricing will be increased for the Extension Term. DaVita has indicated to Rockwell that DaVita expects volumes to decline during\nthe Extension Term. DaVita is required to provide a twelve-month binding forecast on or before December 15, 2024. In the event that DaVita does not meet its\nforecasts, it is required to pay the Company for the amount forecasted or purchase additional product; otherwise, the Company may terminate the Amended\nAgreement. Upon expiration or termination of the Amended Agreement, and upon request by DaVita, the Company has agreed it would provide transition services to\nDaVita during a transition period. As of the date of this filing, the Company has received no such notification.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nRevenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, major product line, and timing of revenue recognition.\nIn thousands Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nProducts By Geographic Area Total U.S. Rest of World Total U.S. Rest of World\nDrug Revenues\nLicense Fee – Over time $ 11 $ — $ 11 $ 34 $ — $ 34\nTotal Drug Products 11 — 11 34 — 34\nConcentrate Products\nProduct Sales – Point-in-time 28,305 26,247 2,058 76,790 70,390 6,400\nTotal Concentrate Products 28,305 26,247 2,058 76,790 70,390 6,400\nNet Revenue $ 28,316 $ 26,247 $ 2,069 $ 76,824 $ 70,390 $ 6,434\nIn thousands Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nProducts By Geographic Area Total U.S. Rest of World Total U.S. Rest of World\nDrug Revenues\nLicense Fee – Over time $ 2,197 $ — $ 2,197 $ 2,327 $ — $ 2,327\nTotal Drug Products 2,197 — 2,197 2,327 — 2,327\nConcentrate Products\nProduct Sales – Point-in-time 21,574 19,741 1,833 57,720 52,326 5,394\nLicense Fee – Over time — — — 1,472 1,472 —\nTotal Concentrate Products 21,574 19,741 1,833 59,192 53,798 5,394\nNet Revenue $ 23,771 $ 19,741 $ 4,030 $ 61,519 $ 53,798 $ 7,721\nContract balances\nThe following table provides information about receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.\nIn thousands September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nAccounts Receivable, net $ 8,886 $ 10,901 $ 6,259\nContract Liabilities, which are included in deferred license revenue $ 487 $ 521 $ 4,331\nThere were no other material contract assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Deferred License Revenue\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Baxter, which had a term of 10 years, and received an upfront fee of $20\nmillion. Under the exclusive distribution agreement, Baxter distributed and commercialized Rockwell’s hemodialysis concentrates products and provided customer\nservice and order delivery to nearly all U.S. customers. The upfront fee was recorded as deferred license revenue and was being recognized based on the proportion of\nproduct shipments to Baxter in each period, compared with total expected sales volume over the term of the distribution agreement. On November 9, 2022, Rockwell\nincurred a fee to Baxter, which was reflected as a reduction to revenue on the consolidated statements of operations, and was payable in two equal installments on\nJanuary 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023, to reacquire its distribution rights to its hemodialysis concentrates products from Baxter and terminated the distribution agreement.\nExclusivity and other provisions associated with the distribution agreement terminated November 9, 2022 and the remaining operational elements of the agreement\nterminated December 31, 2022. To ensure that customer needs continued to be met after January 1, 2023, Rockwell agreed to provide certain services to a group of\nBaxter's customers until March 31, 2023, and Baxter and Rockwell worked together to transition customers’ purchases of Rockwell’s hemodialysis concentrates\nthrough that date. Following the reacquisition of these rights, Rockwell is now unrestricted in its ability to sell its hemodialysis concentrates products to dialysis clinics\nthroughout the United States and around the world. The Company recognized the remaining revenue of $1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nThe remaining agreements with Sun Pharma, Jeil Pharmaceutical, and Drogsan Pharmaceuticals comprise the current and long-term portions of deferred\nlicense revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n11. Stockholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock\nOn April 6, 2022, the Company and DaVita entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the \"SPA\"), which provided for the issuance by the Company of\nup to $15 million of preferred stock to DaVita. On April 6, 2022, the Company issued 7,500 shares of Series X Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $7.5 million. On\nJune 16, 2022, the Company issued an additional 7,500 shares of the Series X Preferred Stock to DaVita for gross proceeds of $7.5 million.\nThe Series X Preferred Stock was issued for a price of $1,000 per share (the \"Face Amount\"), subject to accretion at a rate of 1% per annum, compounded\nannually. If the Company’s common stock trades above $22.00 for a period of 30 calendar days, the accretion will thereafter cease. As of September 30, 2024, the\nSeries X Preferred Stock accreted a total of $0.3 million.\nThe Series X Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible to common stock at a rate equal to the Face Amount, divided by a conversion price of $11.00 per\nshare (subject to adjustment for future stock splits, reverse stock splits and similar recapitalization events). As a result, each share of Series X Preferred Stock will\ninitially convert into approximately 91 shares of common stock. DaVita’s right to convert to common stock is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation, which is\ninitially set at 9.9% of the outstanding common stock, which limitation may be reset (not to exceed 19.9%) at DaVita’s option and upon providing prior written notice\nto the Company. In addition, any debt financing is limited by the terms of our SPA with DaVita. Specifically, until DaVita owns less than 50% of its investment, the\nCompany may only incur additional debt in the form of a purchase money loan, a working capital line of up to $5 million, or refinance existing debt, unless DaVita\nconsents.\nAdditionally, the Series X Preferred Stock has a deemed liquidation event and redemption clause which could be triggered if the sale of all or substantially all\nof the Company's assets relating to the Company's dialysis concentrates business line. Since the Series X Preferred Stock may be redeemed if certain assets are sold at\nthe option of the holder, but is not mandatorily redeemable and the sale of the assets that would allow for redemption is within the control of the Company, the\npreferred stock has been classified as permanent equity and initially recognized at fair value of $15 million (the proceeds on the date of issuance) less issuance costs of\n$0.1 million, resulting in an initial value of $14.9 million. The Company will assess at each reporting period whether conditions have changed to now meet the\nmandatory redemption definition which could trigger liability classification.\nAs of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, authorized and\n15,000 shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reserved for issuance the following shares of common stock related to the potential exercise of employee\nstock options, unvested restricted stock, convertible preferred stock, pre-funded warrants and all other warrants (collectively, \"common stock equivalents\"):\nAs of September 30,\nCommon Stock and Common Stock Equivalents: 2024 2023\nCommon Stock 32,318,806 28,489,663\nCommon Stock Issuable upon Exercise of Pre-funded Warrants — —\nCommon Stock and Pre-funded Stock Warrants 32,318,806 28,489,663\nOptions to Purchase Common Stock 1,874,729 1,367,493\nUnvested Restricted Stock Awards 891 891\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units 534,309 287,400\nConvertible Preferred Stock 1,391,045 1,363,636\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock 3,984,484 4,045,278\nTotal 40,104,264 35,554,361\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, nil and 1,793,000 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised, respectively. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, nil and 6,300,000 Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised, respectively.\nControlled Equity Offering\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement (the \"ATM facility\") with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as Agent, pursuant to which the\nCompany may offer and sell from time to time up to $12.2 million of shares of Company’s common stock through the Agent. The offering and sale of such shares has\nbeen registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 2,990,925 shares were sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of $6.4 million.\nApproximately $4.5 million remains available for sale under the ATM facility.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 10, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. (“Armistice”), which held a\nwarrant (the “Prior Warrant”) to purchase 9,900,990 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) with an exercise price of $1.39 per share,\noffering Armistice the opportunity to exercise the Prior Warrant for cash, provided the Prior Warrant was exercised for cash on or prior to 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on\nJuly 10, 2028 (the “End Date”). In addition, Armistice would receive a “reload” warrant (the “Reload Warrant”) to purchase 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock with\nan exercise price of $5.13 per share, the closing price as reported by the Nasdaq Capital Market\non July 7, 2023. The Reload Warrant may be exercised at all times prior to the 54 months' anniversary of its issuance date. The Prior Warrant and the Reload Warrant\nboth provide that a holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Prior Warrant or the Reload Warrant to the extent that the holder would own\nmore than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock immediately after exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms\nof such warrant. To the extent the exercise of the Prior Warrant would result in Armistice holding more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock,\nsuch shares of Common Stock in excess of 9.99% will be held in abeyance.\nArmistice exercised the Prior Warrant on July 10, 2023, and the Company received gross proceeds of approximately $13.8 million.\nThird Amendment\nIn connection with the execution of the Third Amendment, as defined and described in Note 15, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued to Innovatus a\nwarrant to purchase 191,096 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $1.83 per share. The warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis, and\nis immediately exercisable through January 2, 2029. The number of shares of common stock for which the warrant is exercisable and the exercise price are subject to\ncertain proportional adjustments as set forth in the Third Amendment. The warrant is equity-classified with a fair value of approximately $0.2 million at issuance,\nwhich was treated as a debt issuance cost and will be amortized through interest expense over the remaining contractual term of the Term Loan.\nThe fair value of the warrant at the issuance date was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and include the following assumptions:\nExpected Stock Price Volatility 85.00%\nRisk-free Interest Rate 3.93%\nTerm (years) 5.0\nDividend Yield 0%\n12.

Loan and Security Agreement\nOn March 16, 2020, the Company and Rockwell Transportation, Inc., as Borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\")\nwith Innovatus, as collateral agent and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which Innovatus, as a lender, agreed to make certain term loans to the Company in the\naggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million (the \"Term Loans\"). Funding of the first $22.5 million tranche was completed on March 16, 2020. The Company is\nno longer eligible to draw on additional tranches, which were tied to the achievement of certain milestones. Net draw down proceeds were $21.2 million with closing\ncosts of $1.3 million. The Company also owes an additional fee equal to 4.375% of the funded amount of the Term Loans, or $1.0 million (such additional fee, the\n\"Final Fee\") at maturity. The Company is accreting up to this Final Fee premium with a charge against interest expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nIn connection with each funding of the Term Loans, the Company was required to issue to Innovatus a warrant (the “Warrants”) to purchase a number of\nshares of the Company’s common stock equal to 3.5% of the principal amount of the relevant Term Loan funded divided by the exercise price. In connection with the\nfirst tranche of the Term Loans, the Company issued a Warrant to Innovatus, exercisable for an aggregate of 43,388 shares of the Company’s common stock at an\nexercise price of $18.15 per share. The Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is immediately exercisable through the seventh anniversary of the applicable\nfunding date. The number of shares of common stock for which the Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise price are subject to certain proportional\nadjustments as set forth in such Warrant. The Company evaluated the warrant under ASC 470, Debt, and recognized an additional debt discount of approximately\n$0.5 million based on the relative fair value of the base instruments and warrants. The Company calculated the fair value of the warrant using the Black-Scholes\nmodel.\nThe Term Loan was scheduled to mature on March 16, 2025, and bore interest at the greater of (i) Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii)\n4.75%, plus 4.00%, with an initial interest rate of 8.75% per annum. The Company had the option, under certain circumstances, to add 1.00% of such interest rate\namount to the then outstanding principal balance in lieu of paying such amount in cash.\nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement in which the Company, in exchange for Innovatus lowering the sales\ncovenants, agreed to: (i) prepay an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 million in ten installments commencing on December 1, 2021; (ii) pay an additional prepayment\npremium of 5% on prepaid amounts if the Company elected to prepay all outstanding Term Loans on or before September 24, 2023; and (iii) maintain minimum\nliquidity of no less than $5.0 million if the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans was greater than $15 million pursuant to the liquidity covenant in the Loan\nAgreement.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) dated as of\nNovember 14, 2022 with Innovatus. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company (i) prepaid an additional aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million in Term\nLoans in one installment on November 14, 2022; and (ii) paid interest only payments until September 2023, at which time it resumed scheduled debt payments. The\nfinancial covenant related to the sales of Triferic was replaced with the trailing 6 months revenue of the Company's concentrates products.\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to and Restatement of the Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Third Amendment\") with\nInnovatus, dated January 1, 2024. The Third Amendment provides for the continuation of term loans initially borrowed under the Loan Agreement amounting to\n$8.0 million as of January 1, 2024. The Company will make interest-only payments on the Term Loans for 30 months, or up to 36 months if certain conditions are met.\nThe Company will make equal monthly payments of principal, together with applicable interest, in arrears, starting either August 1, 2026 or February 1, 2027,\ndepending on whether the interest only period is extended to 36 months after the Effective Date. The Term Loans will mature on January 1, 2029, unless earlier repaid.\nEffective on January 1, 2024, the Term Loans bear interest equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) Prime Rate (as defined in the Third Amendment) and (b) 7.50%\nplus (ii) 3.50%. At the Company's option, 2.00% of the interest due on any applicable interest payment date during the interest-only period may be paid in-kind by\nadding such amount to the then outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans. The Term Loans may be voluntarily prepaid in full (but not partially) at any time,\nupon at least seven business days’ prior notice. In connection with any voluntary prepayment or satisfaction of the Term Loans prior to the maturity date (including any\nacceleration), the Company will pay all accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts due in connection with the Term Loans, together with (x) a prepayment fee\n(the “Prepayment Fee”) equal to: (i) 6.0% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid if the payment is made before January 1, 2025; (ii) 2.0% of the principal\namount of the Term Loans prepaid if the payment is made after January 1, 2025 but on or before January 1, 2026; (iii) 1.0% of the principal amount of the Term Loans\nprepaid if the payment is made after January 1, 2026 but on or before January 1, 2027; or (iv) 0% of the principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid if the payment is\nmade after January 1, 2027 through maturity, and (y) the Final Fee. The Term Loans will be mandatorily prepaid upon a change in control of the Company, or upon\nany early termination/acceleration of the Term Loans. In the event of a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans, the Company shall be required to pay the\nPrepayment Fee (if applicable), as well as the Final Fee. The Third Amendment Final Fee shall be due and payable at maturity if it has not previously been paid in full\nin connection with a prepayment of the Term Loans. The Third Amendment was treated as a modification for accounting purposes.\nThe Third Amendment contains various financial covenants and customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, subject to\nexceptions as described in the Third Amendment. The Company's ability to comply with the covenants under the Third Amendment may be adversely affected by\nevents beyond its control. If the Company is unable to comply with the covenants under the Third Amendment, it would pursue all available cure options in order to\nregain compliance. However, the Company may not be able to mutually agree with Innovatus on appropriate remedies to cure a future breach of a covenant, which\ncould give rise to an event of default. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Third Amendment.\nIn connection with the execution of the Third Amendment, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued a warrant to purchase shares of the Company’s common\nstock. The warrant is equity-classified with a fair value of $0.2 million at issuance, which was treated as a debt issuance cost and will be amortized through interest\nexpense over the remaining contractual term of the Term Loan. For additional information, see Note 11.\nThe effective interest rate is 11.5% as of September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense amounted to\n$0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense amounted to $0.7 million and $0.9 million,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $8.4 million, net of unamortized issuance costs and discount of $0.6 million,\nand including $0.8 million of premium accretion, $0.1 million related to a fee resulting from the Third Amendment, and paid-in-kind interest of $0.1 million.\nThe Loan Agreement is secured by all assets of the Company and Rockwell Transportation, Inc. and contains customary representations and warranties and\ncovenants, subject to customary carve outs, and initially included financial covenants related to liquidity and sales of Triferic.\nThe following table reflects the schedule of principal payments on the Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\n2024 (remaining) $ —\n2025 —\n2026 1,366\n2027 3,279\n2028 3,279\n2029 (inclusive of Final Fee) 1,256\nTotal Debt Maturities 9,180\nUnamortized Issuance Costs, Discount and Premium, net (797)\nTerm Loan - Long-Term, net of issuance costs $ 8,383\n16. Insurance Financing Note Payable\nOn June 3, 2023, the Company entered into a short-term note payable for $0.7 million, bearing interest at a rate of 9.59% per annum to finance various\ninsurance policies. Principal and interest payments related to this note began on July 3, 2023 and were paid on a straight-line amortization over nine months with the\nfinal payment due on March 3, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's insurance financing note payable balance was paid in full.\nOn June 24, 2024, the Company entered into a short-term note payable with a principal amount of $0.7 million, bearing interest at a rate of 7.89% per annum\nto finance various insurance policies, which required an upfront payment of $0.2 million. Principal and interest payments related to this note began on July 3, 2024 and\nwill be paid in 10 equal monthly payments of $0.1 million, with the final payment due on April 3, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the insurance\nfinancing note payable was $0.5 million.\n15\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in “Item 1.\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements”. References in this report to “Rockwell,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” are references to Rockwell\nMedical, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe make forward-looking statements in this report and may make such statements in future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\"SEC\"). We may also make forward-looking statements in our press releases or other public or shareholder communications. Our forward-looking statements are\nsubject to risks and uncertainties and include information about our current expectations and possible or assumed future results of our operations.

Factors that might cause such a difference include, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties discussed in this\nreport, “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and from time to time in our other reports filed with the\nSEC.\nOther factors not currently anticipated may also materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. There can be no\nassurance future results will meet expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any intent to update or\nalter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable law.\nOverview\nRockwell Medical is a healthcare company that develops, manufactures, commercializes, and distributes a portfolio of hemodialysis products for dialysis\nproviders worldwide.\nRockwell is the largest supplier of liquid bicarbonate concentrates and the second largest supplier of acid and dry bicarbonate concentrates for dialysis\npatients in the United States. Hemodialysis is the most common form of end-stage kidney disease treatment and is usually performed at freestanding outpatient dialysis\ncenters, at hospital-based outpatient centers, at skilled nursing facilities, or in a patient’s home. This represents a large market opportunity for which we believe\nRockwell's products are well-positioned to meet the needs of patients.\nRockwell delivers the majority of its hemodialysis concentrates products and mixers to dialysis clinics throughout the United States and internationally\nutilizing its own delivery trucks and third-party carriers. Rockwell has developed a core expertise in manufacturing and delivering hemodialysis concentrates, and has\nbuilt a longstanding reputation for reliability, quality, and excellent customer service.\nRockwell provides the hemodialysis community with products controlled by a Quality Management System regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (\"FDA\"). Rockwell is ISO 13485 Certified and adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\") and Association for Advancement of\nMedical Instrumentation (\"AAMI\") standards. Rockwell manufactures hemodialysis concentrates at its facilities in Michigan, South Carolina, and Texas totaling\napproximately 175,000 square feet, and manufactures its dry acid concentrate mixers at its facility in Iowa. In addition, the Company manufactures hemodialysis\nconcentrates in Minnesota under a contract manufacturing agreement with a contract\nmanufacturing organization. (See Note 4 of the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for further detail). On February 12, 2024, the\nCompany entered into an amendment to its contract manufacturing agreement to extend the term to December 31, 2024. The Company plans to transfer the\nmanufacturing of the former Evoqua product line to one of its own manufacturing facilities by the end of 2024, which the Company believes will reduce production\ncosts for these products.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Rockwell Medical received the Notice of Extension of Term (the \"Extension\") of the Amended and\nRestated Products Purchase Agreement (the \"Amended Agreement\"), dated September 21, 2023, which amended and restated the Products Purchase Agreement, dated\nJuly 1, 2019, with DaVita. The Extension extends the term of the Amended Agreement through December 31, 2025 (the \"Extension Term\"), during which Extension\nTerm product pricing will be increased. DaVita has indicated to Rockwell that DaVita expects volumes to decline during the Extension Term as DaVita works to\ndiversify its supplier base. Rockwell believes that net sales to DaVita in 2025 will decline between approximately $31 million and $37 million. DaVita is required to\nprovide Rockwell with a twelve-month binding forecast on or before December 15, 2024, at which time the Company will be able to determine the actual impact on\nnet sales in 2025. Under the terms of the Amended Agreement, DaVita is committed to purchasing at least the amount provided in the binding forecast. DaVita's\nproduct purchases have historically ranged between a gross loss to single digit gross margin, excluding the special large order of premium-priced product described\nbelow.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 % of Revenue 2023 % of Revenue % Change\nNet Sales $ 28,316 $ 23,771 19 %\nCost of Sales 22,077 78 % 21,569 91 % 2 %\nGross Profit 6,239 22 % 2,202 9 %\nResearch and Product Development — — % 494 2 % (100)%\nSelling and Marketing 726 3 % 556 2 % 31 %\nGeneral and Administrative 3,577 13 % 2,889 12 % 24 %\nOperating Income (Loss) $ 1,936 6 % $ (1,737) (7)%\nNet Sales\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were $28.3 million compared to net sales of $23.8 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase of $4.5 million was due to $6.7 million from product revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million from non-product\nrevenue. Overall, product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $28.3 million compared to product revenue of $21.6 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $6.7 million was driven by $4.5 million from a special large order of premium-priced product, as well as $2.5\nmillion of increased sales and price increases to existing customers. Net sales of non-product revenue were not material during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to non-product revenue of $2.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was the result of deferred license revenue\nrecognition related to the termination of the Wanbang Agreement.\nGross Profit\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.1 million, resulting in gross profit of $6.2 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to cost of sales of $21.6 million and a gross profit of $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit\nincreased by $4.0 million driven by $1.5 million from a special large order of premium-priced product, as well as $2.5 million from increased sales and price increases\nto existing customers and $1.1 million of lower costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million associated with the termination of the Wanbang agreement for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\nResearch and Product Development Expense\n16\nResearch and product development expenses were nil and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease\nof approximately $0.5 million was driven by severance cost in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nSelling and Marketing Expense\nSelling and marketing expenses were $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $2.9 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to bonuses.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by interest\nexpense related to our debt facility (See Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q). For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the interest expense is partially offset by $0.2 million of realized gains on available-for-sale investments.\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 % of Revenue 2023 % of Revenue % Change\nNet Sales $ 76,824 $ 61,519 25 %\nCost of Sales 62,971 82 % 55,685 91 % 13 %\nGross Profit 13,853 18 % 5,834 9 %\nResearch and Product Development 18 — % 939 2 % (98)%\nSelling and Marketing 1,906 2 % 1,584 3 % 20 %\nGeneral and Administrative 10,802 14 % 9,434 15 % 15 %\nOperating Loss $ 1,127 2 % $ (6,123) (11)%\nNet Sales\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales were $76.8 million compared to net sales of $61.5 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $76.8 million compared to product revenue of $57.7 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $19.1 million was primarily due to $6.4 million from customers added through the Evoqua asset acquisition, $5.4\nmillion from a special large order of premium-priced product, as well as $7.2 million of increased sales and price increases to existing customers. Net sales of non-\nproduct revenue were not material during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nwhich was the result of $2.3 million and $1.5 million of deferred license revenue recognition related to the terminations of the Wanbang Agreement and Baxter\nDistribution Agreement, respectively.\n17\nGross Profit\nCost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $63.0 million, resulting in gross profit of $13.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to cost of sales of $55.7 million and a gross profit of $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit\nincreased by $8.0 million driven by $7.1 million of price increases to existing customers, $1.6 million from a special large order of premium-priced product and $1.4\nmillion of lower costs, partially offset by $1.5 million and $1.1 million of gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with deferred license\nrevenue recognition related to the terminations of the Baxter Distribution Agreement and the Wanbang agreement, respectively.\nResearch and Product Development Expense\nResearch and product development expenses were immaterial and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The\ndecrease of approximately $0.9 million is due to the decision to pause all research and development related to Triferic in 2023.\nSelling and Marketing Expense\nSelling and marketing expenses were $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of\n$0.3 million is primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $9.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase of $1.4 million was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to bonuses, additional administrative costs and\namortization of intangible assets.\nOther Expense\nTotal other expense of $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was driven by interest expense of\n$1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to our debt facility (See Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form\n10-Q), partially offset by $0.1 million and $0.2 million of interest income, respectively, as well as realized gains on available-for-sale of investments of $0.1 million\nand $0.2 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $18.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale, and working capital of $20.0\nmillion. Based on the currently available working capital along with the expectation of management of its ability to execute on its operational plans as discussed\nbelow, management believes the Company currently has sufficient funds to meet its operating requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of the\nfiling of this report.\nAdditionally, the Company's operational plans include raising capital, if needed, by using the $4.5 million remaining availability under its at-the-market\n(\"ATM\") facility or other methods or forms of financings, subject to existing limitations. Under the ATM, we have the ability to control the timing and price at which\ncapital is raised.\nThe actual amount of cash that we will need to execute our business strategy is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the costs associated with\nour manufacturing and transportation operations related to our concentrate business.\nWe may elect to raise capital in the future through one or more of the following: (i) equity and debt raises through the equity and capital markets, though there\ncan be no assurance we will be able to secure additional capital or funding on acceptable terms, or if at all; and (ii) strategic transactions, including potential alliances\nand collaborations focused on markets outside the United States, as well as potential combinations (including by merger or acquisition) or other corporate transactions.\nWe believe our ability to fund our activities in the long term will be highly dependent upon (i) our ability to execute on the growth strategy of our hemodialysis\nconcentrates business and maintain sales with existing customers, (ii) our ability to achieve sustained profitability, and (iii) our ability to identify, develop, in-license,\nor acquire new products in developing our renal care product portfolio. All of these strategies are subject to significant risks and uncertainties such that there can be no\nassurance we will be successful in achieving them. If we are unsuccessful in executing our business plan and we are unable to raise the required capital, we may be\nforced to curtail all of our activities and, ultimately, cease operations. Even if we are able to raise sufficient capital, such financings may only be available on\nunattractive terms, or result in significant dilution of stockholders’ interests and, in such event, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf the Company attempts to obtain additional debt or equity financing, the Company cannot assume such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at\nall. In addition, any debt financing is limited by the terms of our Securities Purchase Agreement with DaVita. Specifically, until DaVita owns less than 50% of its\ninvestment, the Company may only incur additional debt in the form of a purchase money loan, a working capital line of up to $5 million or to refinance existing debt,\nunless DaVita consents.\nThe Company is subject to certain covenants and cure provisions under its Loan Agreement with Innovatus. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in\ncompliance with all covenants. On January 2, 2024, the Company's Loan Agreement was amended to include, among other things, an interest-only period for 30\nmonths, or up to 36 months if certain conditions are met, and extend the maturity date to January 1, 2029 (See Note 15 to the accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements).\nThe global macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes\nwith other countries, instability in the global capital and credit markets, recent bank failures in the United States, supply chain weaknesses, and instability in the\ngeopolitical environment, including as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Middle East conflict and other political tensions, and the occurrence of natural\ndisasters and public health crises. Such challenges have caused, and may continue to cause, recession fears, rising interest rates, foreign exchange volatility and\ninflationary pressures. At this time, the Company is unable to quantify the potential effects of this economic instability on our future operations. Due to the rapidly\nevolving nature of the global situation, it is not possible to predict the extent to which these conditions could adversely affect the Company's liquidity and capital\nresources in the future.\nCash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in operating activities of\n$9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash provided by operating activities during the current period as compared to cash used in\noperating activities in the prior period was primarily due to (i) an increase in net income of approximately $7.2 million, (ii) an increase in cash provided by changes in\ncurrent balance sheet accounts in the ordinary course of business of approximately $5.9 million, primarily due to increases of $5.1 million of accounts receivable, net\nand $3.8 million of deferred license revenue, partially offset by decreases of $1.8 million of accounts payable and $1.2 million of inventory, partially offset by (iii) a\ndecrease in cash provided from non-cash adjustments primarily related to a decrease of $0.8 million in inventory reserves.\nCash Used In Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of\n$5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven\nprimarily by (i) net cash payments from purchases and sales of our available-for-sale investments of $3.9 million during the period. Net cash used in investing\nactivities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the cash paid in connection with the Evoqua Asset Acquisition of $12.4 million,\npartially offset by the net cash proceeds from sales and purchase of available-for-sale investments during the period of $7.5 million.\nCash Provided By Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $4.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing\nactivities of $12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas primarily due to the gross proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the ATM facility of $6.4 million, partially offset by the cash paid in\nconnection with the Evoqua Asset Acquisition of $1.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily\ndue to the gross proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of the Prior Warrant and Pre-Funded Warrants of $13.8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nSee Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional disclosures.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nPer §229.305 of Regulation S-K, the Company, designated a Smaller Reporting Company as defined in §229.10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, is not required to\nprovide the disclosure required by this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure material information required to be disclosed in our reports we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In\ndesigning and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management was required to apply its\njudgment in evaluating the cost‑benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that\noccurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n18\nWe may be involved in certain routine legal proceedings from time to time before various courts and governmental agencies. We cannot predict the final\ndisposition of such proceedings. We regularly review legal matters and record provisions for claims considered probable of loss. The resolution of these pending\nproceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our operations or consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are resolved.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023.
