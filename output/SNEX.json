          "content": "NASDAQ: SNEX\nwww.StoneX.com\nStoneX Group Inc. (“StoneX”) Business Resiliency Disclosure\nBusiness Resiliency Planning\nStone X (“the Company”) and its affiliates have established a global business resiliency (“BR”) planning\npolicy and program to assess and manage the effects of an emergency or significant business disruption on its\noperations to provide resiliency of critical business functions. Since the timing and impact of disasters and\ndisruptions is unpredictable, the Company needs to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. The\nCompany’s business resiliency plan addresses: data back-up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and\noperational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate\nphysical location for employees; counterparty impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring customers prompt\nservice. With that in mind, the Company is providing you with this information about its business resiliency plan.\nThe BR planning program begins with a review of each department and an analysis of its business\nresiliency risk via a Business Impact Analysis (“BIA”). This BIA process encompasses all aspects of the Company’s\nkey business functions. The analysis defines, for each business process, its department, department manager, the\nprocess criticality/recovery time objective, applications and third parties required to perform the process,\nalternate processing strategies, financial or legal/regulatory impacts, etc. This information is all used and built into\na department level BR plan.\nThe department level BR plans are reviewed and updated as significant business changes occur and\nregulatory sign off takes place annually. The BR plan is designed to account for the actions the company will take in\nthe event of disruptions that can vary in terms of scope and severity. The company BR plans encompass alternate\nprocessing strategies for 7 major disruptions buckets: Loss of Applications, Phones, Staff, Power, Building, Critical\nthird parties and Pandemic. By utilizing this type of methodology, the company feels that it can respond to various\nincidents and continue critical business processes. This includes incidents involving an office building where any of\nthe company’s offices may reside. It also includes information regarding staff unavailability, where staff members\nmay be unable to work at their normal business location.\nThe Company is diversely dispersed with its regional and out-of-region office locations to back up critical\nfunctions, data and system applications including alternative manual procedures identified to enable continued\nfunctionality. The BR plan has been reasonably designed to allow the company to continue its business operations\nand safeguard the interests of its clients. The Company expects to be able to meet its client obligations within the\nday. While the company's business resiliency plan has been reasonably designed to allow it to operate during\nemergency incidents of varying scope, such potential incidents are unpredictable. The Company’s business\nresiliency plan is subject to change without notice. Nothing contained in this document amends or changes any of\nthe terms set forth in any agreements between the company and any of its customers.\nFor further information, please feel free to contact us at: dg-businessresiliency@stonex.com\nStoneX Business Resiliency Disclosure (Revised - Jan. 2023)"
