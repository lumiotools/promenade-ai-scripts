Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n# Sanara MedTech Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n**FORT WORTH, TX, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sanara MedTech Inc**. Based in Fort Worth, Texas, Sanara MedTech Inc. (“Sanara,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) (Nasdaq: SMTI), a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical, chronic wound and skincare markets, today reported its strategic, operational and financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 was Sanara’s twelfth consecutive record net revenue quarter, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire organization,” stated Ron Nixon, Sanara’s Executive Chairman and CEO. “Looking ahead, we remain focused on continuing to execute our growth strategy and delivering exceptional value to both our customers and shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Strategic, Operational and Financial Highlights (Unaudited)**\n\n  * Net revenue increased 35% year-over-year to $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $2.9 million, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * The Company generated Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * The Company currently has agreements with 300+ distributors (+50 since January 2024) with 2,900+ potential sellers (+500 since January 2024).\n  * The Company’s products were sold in over 1,200 facilities across 34 states plus the District of Columbia, based on a minimum of $50,000 of revenue, during the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n  * The Company’s products were contracted or approved to be sold in more than 4,000 hospitals as of September 30, 2024.\n  * On October 4, 2024, the Company appointed Mr. Keith Myers to serve as a director on its Board. Mr. Myers is the chairman and CEO emeritus of LHC Group, one of the largest and highest quality in-home healthcare providers in the United States. He co-founded LHC Group in 1994 and led its growth from a single home health agency to a publicly traded company with approximately 29,000 employees and approximately 950 agency locations across 38 states and the District of Columbia, until its merger with Optum Inc. in 2023.\n  * The Company announced that Sanara CMP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, invested $5.0 million in exchange for an ownership percentage of approximately 6.64% in ChemoMouthpiece, LLC (“CMp”), which owns and manufactures a 510(k) cleared cryotherapy device designed to reduce the incidence and severity of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis. In connection with the investment, the Company announced the execution of an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with CMp. This product aligns well with Sanara’s wound and skin care strategy, which includes the licensed collagen peptides from Tufts University that focus on radiation dermatitis. The American Medical Association recently issued the CPT code (effective July 2024) to be applied for potential reimbursement by physicians and payers for the use of an oral cavity device for a cryotherapy procedure in conjunction with chemotherapy. SI Healthcare Technologies, LLC, a joint venture entity owned 50/50 by Sanara and InfuSystem Inc., will be the exclusive distributor of CMp’s Standard Chemo Regiment kits in the United States. The product is currently being introduced to the market and is expected to be commercially launched in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Revenue Analysis (Consolidated)**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to further penetrate existing accounts while also expanding into new territories, growing the number of facilities where our products were sold to 900+ in Q3 2024 compared to 600+ in Q3 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Sanara generated net revenue of $21.7 million compared to net revenue of $16.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a 35% increase from the prior year period. The higher net revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was due to increased sales of soft tissue repair products (CellerateRX® Surgical Activated Collagen®, BIASURGE®, FORTIFY TRG® Tissue Repair Graft and FORTIFY FLOWABLE® Extracellular Matrix), increased market penetration, and geographic expansion and the Company’s continuing strategy to expand its independent distribution network in both new and existing U.S. markets.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Analysis (Consolidated)**\n\nSanara reported a net loss of $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The higher net loss in 2024 was primarily due to increased SG&A costs related to the buildout of our Tissue Health Plus (“THP”) platform and infrastructure, which increased by approximately $1.2 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in net loss for the period also included higher interest expense of $0.7 million as a result of our loan with CRG Servicing LLC, and an increase in expense due to change in fair value of earnout liabilities of $0.8 million. These increased costs were partially offset by higher gross profit.\n\nThe Company generated Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_* Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information._\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Analysis (Segmented)**\n\nSanara Surgical generated a net loss of $0.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $0.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The higher Sanara Surgical net loss in 2024 was primarily due to increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of earnout liabilities. THP generated a net loss of $2.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The higher THP net loss in 2024 was primarily due to higher SG&A costs related to the buildout of the THP platform and technology.\n\nSanara Surgical generated Segment EBITDA* of $2.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to Segment EBITDA* of $1.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. THP generated Segment EBITDA* of ($1.7) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to Segment EBITDA* of ($1.1) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n* Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nSanara will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Announce Exclusive United States Distribution Agreement with, and Minority Investment in, ChemoMouthpiece, LLC\n\n# Sanara MedTech Inc. and InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. Announce Exclusive United States Distribution Agreement with, and Minority Investment in, ChemoMouthpiece, LLC\n\n**FORT WORTH, TX / GlobeNewswire / September 11, 2024 / Sanara MedTech Inc**. Based in Fort Worth, Texas, Sanara MedTech Inc. (“Sanara,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) (NASDAQ: SMTI), a medical technology company focused on improving clinical outcomes and reducing healthcare expenditures in the surgical, chronic wound and skincare markets, and InfuSystem, Inc. (“InfuSystem”), the operational subsidiary of Sanara’s joint venture partner InfuSystem Holdings, Inc., announced today the execution of an exclusive United States distribution agreement with, and minority investment in, ChemoMouthpiece, LLC (“ChemoMouthpiece”).\n\nRon Nixon, Sanara’s CEO, stated, “Oral mucositis is a debilitating condition impacting hundreds of thousands of oncology patients annually. ChemoMouthpiece has developed a clinically validated product with FDA 510(k) clearance that can bring relief to affected patients. The American Medical Association has recently issued the CPT code (effective July 2024) to be applied for potential reimbursement by physicians and payers for the use of an oral cavity device for a cryotherapy procedure in conjunction with chemotherapy. The product aligns well with Sanara’s skincare strategy, which includes the licensed collagen peptides from Tufts University that focus on radiation dermatitis. We look forward to providing the Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device to oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy.”\n\n**Transaction Overview**\n\n  * ChemoMouthpiece owns and manufactures a 510(k) cleared device that uses cryotherapy to reduce the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in patients undergoing stomatotoxic chemotherapy treatments.\n\n\n  * SI Healthcare Technologies, LLC (f/k/a SI Wound Care, LLC) (“SI Technologies”), a 50/50 joint venture between Sanara and InfuSystem, will be the exclusive distributor of ChemoMouthpiece’s kits in the United States.\n\n\n  * SI Technologies plans to market and distribute the product through InfuSystem to approximately 3,000 cancer centers through InfuSystem’s existing sales team.\n\n\n  * SI Technologies will purchase the product kits from ChemoMouthpiece at a fixed price and pay a royalty on net revenues for the use of the product intellectual property. \n\n\n  * Sanara invested $5 million for a 6.6% ownership position in ChemoMouthpiece.\n\n\n  * SI Technologies will have a purchase option that expires on January 31, 2029 to purchase the U.S. business of ChemoMouthpiece, including all U.S. intellectual property related to the product.\n\n\n  * Sanara has drawn $15.5 million on its term loan with CRG Servicing, LLC and will fund this investment as part of that draw.\n\n\n\n**Oral Mucositis**\n\nOral mucositis causes painful mouth ulcers, which are a common complication of chemotherapy and radiation. In the U.S., there are an estimated 500,000 – 1,000,000 patients who have oral mucositis annually and the estimated market size exceeds $600 million. SI Technologies believes this product will show material cost reductions for oncology treatment centers, improve patient quality of life and allow for continued treatment of cancer therapy for patients. ChemoMouthpiece is planning to publish studies in the future reinforcing the efficacy of their product.\n\nRichard Dilorio, InfuSystem’s CEO, stated, “Sanara and InfuSystem entered into our partnership in order to bring together our combined technical, operational and commercial strengths to deliver proprietary efficacious products to patients. We believe this exclusive agreement, which builds on our partnership, will allow us to do that by offering the Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device and bringing potential relief to thousands of cancer patients suffering from oral mucositis.”\n\nDavid Yoskowitz, ChemoMouthpiece’s President and CEO stated, “We are pleased to have selected SI Technologies as our exclusive distribution partner in the United States. We believe that InfuSystem’s experienced team of seasoned oncology professionals currently calling on approximately 3,000 U.S. cancer centers will accelerate the uptake of the Chemo Mouthpiece, bringing a much-needed option for patients that would otherwise suffer from the debilitating effects of oral mucositis.” David added, “We understand that the executive team of SI Technologies has a long history of launching products into the oncology space, and coupled with Sanara’s ownership position in ChemoMouthpiece, we are confident that they will execute the successful launch of the Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device.”\n\nPickwick Capital Partners, LLC, served as the exclusive advisor to ChemoMouthpiece on this transaction. \n\n**About ChemoMouthpiece, LLC**\n\nChemoMouthpiece, LLC is a privately held medical device company that develops and commercializes propriety oral cryotherapy products for cancer patients. The Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device was developed based on the personal experience of inventor, founder and CEO, David Yoskowitz, who when diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, experienced oral mucositis firsthand. His treatment options included ice chips to mitigate and minimize the pain. Yet this caused nausea, was difficult to maintain in his mouth, and did not effectively cool the entire oral cavity which led him to search for a better option. The Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device cools down the entire oral cavity, causing vasoconstriction, which in effect slows and reduces the flow of chemotherapy in the oral cavity, thus greatly reducing the risk of developing oral mucositis. The cryotherapy approach has been positively studied for decades and the Chemo Mouthpiece® oral cryotherapy device has significant and improved advantages over conventional cryotherapy interventions.
