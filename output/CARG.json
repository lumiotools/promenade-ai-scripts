Guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 excludes macro-level industry issues that result in dealers and consumers materially changing their recent market trends or that cause us to enact measures to assist dealers. Guidance also excludes any potential impact of foreign currency exchange gains or losses.\n\nCarGurus has not reconciled its guidance of non-GAAP consolidated adjusted EBITDA to GAAP consolidated net loss or non-GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS because reconciling items between such GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, which include, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, goodwill and other asset impairment, depreciation expenses, non-intangible amortization, transaction-related expenses, other income, net, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and income tax effects, cannot be reasonably predicted due to, as applicable, the timing, amount, valuation, and number of future employee equity awards, and the uncertainty relating to the timing, frequency, and effect of acquisitions and the significance of the resulting transaction-related expenses, and therefore cannot be determined without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nCarGurus will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business outlook at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, November 7, 2024. To access the conference call, dial (844) 834-0648 for callers in the U.S. or Canada, or (412) 542-4103 for international callers.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to, as applicable, the timing, amount, valuation, and number of future employee equity awards and the uncertainty relating to the timing, frequency, and effect of acquisitions and the significance of the resulting transaction-related expenses, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\n\nWe monitor operating measures of certain non-GAAP items including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP expense, non-GAAP consolidated net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders, and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, amortization of intangible assets, goodwill and other asset impairment, and transaction related-expenses. Non-GAAP consolidated net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders, and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders also exclude certain income tax effects and adjustments. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders also exclude non-GAAP net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest. We define non-GAAP net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, and amortization of intangible assets. These exclusions are adjusted for redeemable noncontrolling interest, as applicable. Our calculations of non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders utilize applicable GAAP share counts as included in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release. In addition, we evaluate our non-GAAP gross profit in relation to our revenue. We refer to this as non-GAAP gross profit margin and define it as non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nWe define Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, goodwill and other asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, transaction-related expenses, other income, net, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, other long-lived asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, other expense, net, and provision for income taxes. These exclusions are adjusted for redeemable noncontrolling interest of 38% by taking the noncontrolling interest's full financial results and multiplying each line item in the reconciliation by 38%. We note that we use 38%, versus 49%, to allocate the share of loss because it represents the portion attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. The 38% is exclusive of CO Incentive Units, Subject Units, and 2021 Incentive Units (as each term is defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024), which are liability-classified awards that do not participate in the share of loss. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is reflective of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction. Following the 2023 CarOffer Transaction there was no redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 1, 2023, and as a result, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIn addition, we evaluate our Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in relation to our revenue. We refer to this as Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin and define it as Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\n\nWe have presented Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest because it is used by our management to reconcile Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. It represents the portion of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interest. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is not intended to be reviewed on its own.\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations, adjusted to include purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of website development costs. We have presented Free Cash Flow because it is a measure of our financial performance that represents the cash that we are able to generate after expenditures required to maintain or expand our asset base.\n\nWe define a paying dealer as a dealer account with an active, paid marketplace subscription at the end of a defined period. The number of paying dealers we have is important to us and we believe it provides valuable information to investors because it is indicative of the value proposition of our marketplace products, as well as our sales and marketing success and opportunity, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.\n\nWe define Quarterly Average Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (\"QARSD\"), which is measured at the end of a fiscal quarter, as the marketplace revenue primarily from subscriptions to our Listings packages and Real-time Performance Marketing, our digital advertising suite, and other digital add-on products during that trailing quarter divided by the average number of paying dealers in that marketplace during the quarter. We calculate the average number of paying dealers for a period by adding the number of paying dealers at the end of such period and the end of the prior period and dividing by two. This information is important to us, and we believe it provides useful information to investors, because we believe that our ability to grow QARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the return on investment that our paying dealers realize from our products. In addition, increases in QARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven in part by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.\n\nWe define Transactions within the Digital Wholesale segment as the number of vehicles processed from car dealers, consumers, and other marketplaces through the CarOffer website within the applicable period. Transactions consists of each unique vehicle (based on vehicle identification number) that reaches \"sold and invoiced\" status on the CarOffer website within the applicable period, including vehicles sold to car dealers, vehicles sold at third-party auctions, vehicles ultimately sold to a different buyer, and vehicles that are returned to their owners without completion of a sale transaction. We exclude vehicles processed within CarOffer's intra-group trading solution (Group Trade) from the definition of Transactions, and we only count any unique vehicle once even if it reaches sold status multiple times. Digital Wholesale includes the purchase and sale of vehicles between dealers, or Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, and Sell My Car - Instant Max Cash Offer transactions. We view Transactions as a key business metric, and we believe it provides useful information to investors, because it provides insight into growth and revenue for the Digital Wholesale segment. Transactions drive a significant portion of Digital Wholesale segment revenue. We believe growth in Transactions demonstrates consumer and dealer utilization and our market share penetration in the Digital Wholesale segment.\n\nHistorically, we have used data from Google Analytics to measure two of our key business metrics: monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Effective July 1, 2024, GA4 replaced Google Analytics. The methodologies used in GA4 are different and not comparable to the methodologies used in Google Analytics. As discussed below, we also make certain adjustments to the GA4 data in order to improve the accuracy of the reported monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Due to this change in methodology, we are unable to provide comparable monthly unique user and monthly session information for prior periods, including any periods prior to June 30, 2024.\n\nFor each of our websites (excluding the CarOffer website), we define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited any such website and taken a visitor action (as defined below) within a calendar month, based on data as measured by GA4. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users of each of our websites in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, we count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses any of our websites or application during a calendar month and takes an action on such website or in such application, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer (a \"visitor action\"). If an individual accesses a website or application using a different device within a given month, the first visitor action taken by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual uses multiple browsers on a single device and/or clears their cookies and returns to our website or application and takes a visitor action within a calendar month, each such visitor action is counted as a separate unique user. We eliminate any duplicate unique users that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because our marketplace revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer’s website or map directions to the dealership.\n\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites (excluding the CarOffer website) that include a visitor action that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by GA4. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, a session is defined as beginning with the first visitor action from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window or after 30 minutes of inactivity. We eliminate any duplicate monthly sessions that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We believe that measuring the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an important indicator to us of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because the more satisfied and engaged consumers we have, the more valuable our service is to dealers.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTY2NyM2NTcwMTI2IzIwODEwODM=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MzJmZDU1ZWEtNDhjNC00NjNlLWJhNjgtMWY2NjVhMzlhZTMxLTEwOTI2NTQ=/tiny/CarGurus-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/eb5c3334-b347-4bd8-a757-c918e998a8e1/small/cargurus-digital-color-registered-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/eb5c3334-b347-4bd8-a757-c918e998a8e1)\n\nSource: CarGurus, Inc.\n\n**Kirndeep Singh** VP, Head of Investor Relations investors@cargurus.com\n\n## Connect with us:\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cargurus) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cargurus) [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/cargurus/) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/cargurus) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cargurus/) [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cargurus)\n\n  * United States (EN)\n\n    * [United States (EN) ](https://www.cargurus.com/?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Estados Unidos (ES) ](https://www.cargurus.com/es?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Canada (EN) ](https://ca.cargurus.com/?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Canada (FR) ](https://ca.cargurus.com/fr?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [United Kingdom ](https://www.cargurus.co.uk/?pid=countryPicker)\n\n\n\n"

CarGurus Digital Deal enables consumers to start their financing application online for eligible new and used vehicles, book an appointment, and start a trade-in before completing the process at the dealership.\n\n“By allowing car shoppers to handle more steps from the comfort of home, CarGurus Digital Deal helps facilitate a more seamless online to in-store experience that benefits both sides of the transaction,” said Seamus Cassidy, Principal Product Manager with CarGurus. “Dealers can access ready-to-buy shoppers while continuing to work with their preferred technology systems and lending partners. At the same time, consumers can shop with greater confidence by understanding their financing eligibility up front, and save time in the dealership by completing more of the transaction ahead of time.”\n\nCarGurus’ Digital Deal solution launches in Canada after experiencing strong demand in the U.S., where it is one of the company’s [fastest-growing innovations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2B9NjH_R00oqOInGyVedsD8w52Zzxj6UbO8htmOg6cd8L-npPwQiUIWfVTC8cE8KhMzZlawe-a-J-sYEzHSZ2jpnIqKpKnF1uILIT1zSLceAV2fJDs5psw17Btb3LtsM5yb5Ss3TJG-MO9lS-YmVuA==). Active listings are easy to find with badging on CarGurus.ca search results and vehicle detail pages. From eligible vehicle pages, shoppers can complete a simple three-step process to build a personalized vehicle and dealership-specific finance application that is submitted directly to the participating dealership. Shoppers can also schedule an appointment at the dealership and share details about a trade-in. At the dealership, shoppers can then finalize their financing and complete the transaction.\n\nThe solution is built in partnership with dealer finance portal platform CreditApp and can be configured to work with a dealer’s preferred lender networks. As part of the initial rollout, CarGurus Digital Deal is active across over 15,000 vehicle listings, helping participating dealers throughout Canada connect with higher-converting leads for faster, more efficient sales.\n\n\"Digital Deal leads have significantly assisted our sales and finance teams in simplifying the buying process. By having this information upfront, our team can better prepare and creatively engage with our shoppers,” said Casey Pilip, Director of Marketing at Klas Auto Group, a dealer of new and used cars in British Columbia. “Successfully converting additional leads each month at a high closing percentage truly makes a significant impact in today's market.\"\n\nDealers can sign up for CarGurus Digital Deal today.

Guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 excludes macro-level industry issues that result in dealers and consumers materially changing their recent market trends or that cause us to enact measures to assist dealers. Guidance also excludes any potential impact of foreign currency exchange gains or losses.\n\nCarGurus has not reconciled its guidance of non-GAAP consolidated adjusted EBITDA to GAAP consolidated net loss or non-GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS because reconciling items between such GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, which include, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, goodwill and other asset impairment, depreciation expenses, non-intangible amortization, transaction-related expenses, other income, net, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and income tax effects, cannot be reasonably predicted due to, as applicable, the timing, amount, valuation, and number of future employee equity awards, and the uncertainty relating to the timing, frequency, and effect of acquisitions and the significance of the resulting transaction-related expenses, and therefore cannot be determined without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nCarGurus will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business outlook at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, November 7, 2024.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to, as applicable, the timing, amount, valuation, and number of future employee equity awards and the uncertainty relating to the timing, frequency, and effect of acquisitions and the significance of the resulting transaction-related expenses, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\n\nWe monitor operating measures of certain non-GAAP items including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP expense, non-GAAP consolidated net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders, and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, amortization of intangible assets, goodwill and other asset impairment, and transaction related-expenses. Non-GAAP consolidated net income, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders, and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders also exclude certain income tax effects and adjustments. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders also exclude non-GAAP net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest. We define non-GAAP net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, and amortization of intangible assets. These exclusions are adjusted for redeemable noncontrolling interest, as applicable. Our calculations of non-GAAP net income per share attributable to common stockholders utilize applicable GAAP share counts as included in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release. In addition, we evaluate our non-GAAP gross profit in relation to our revenue. We refer to this as non-GAAP gross profit margin and define it as non-GAAP gross profit divided by total revenue. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nWe define Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, goodwill and other asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, transaction-related expenses, other income, net, and provision for (benefit from) income taxes.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, other long-lived asset impairment, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, other expense, net, and provision for income taxes. These exclusions are adjusted for redeemable noncontrolling interest of 38% by taking the noncontrolling interest's full financial results and multiplying each line item in the reconciliation by 38%. We note that we use 38%, versus 49%, to allocate the share of loss because it represents the portion attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. The 38% is exclusive of CO Incentive Units, Subject Units, and 2021 Incentive Units (as each term is defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024), which are liability-classified awards that do not participate in the share of loss. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is reflective of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction. Following the 2023 CarOffer Transaction there was no redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 1, 2023, and as a result, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIn addition, we evaluate our Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in relation to our revenue. We refer to this as Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin and define it as Non-GAAP consolidated Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\n\nWe have presented Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest because it is used by our management to reconcile Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. It represents the portion of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interest. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is not intended to be reviewed on its own.\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations, adjusted to include purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of website development costs. We have presented Free Cash Flow because it is a measure of our financial performance that represents the cash that we are able to generate after expenditures required to maintain or expand our asset base.\n\nWe define a paying dealer as a dealer account with an active, paid marketplace subscription at the end of a defined period. The number of paying dealers we have is important to us and we believe it provides valuable information to investors because it is indicative of the value proposition of our marketplace products, as well as our sales and marketing success and opportunity, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.\n\nWe define Quarterly Average Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (\"QARSD\"), which is measured at the end of a fiscal quarter, as the marketplace revenue primarily from subscriptions to our Listings packages and Real-time Performance Marketing, our digital advertising suite, and other digital add-on products during that trailing quarter divided by the average number of paying dealers in that marketplace during the quarter. We calculate the average number of paying dealers for a period by adding the number of paying dealers at the end of such period and the end of the prior period and dividing by two. This information is important to us, and we believe it provides useful information to investors, because we believe that our ability to grow QARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the return on investment that our paying dealers realize from our products. In addition, increases in QARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven in part by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.\n\nWe define Transactions within the Digital Wholesale segment as the number of vehicles processed from car dealers, consumers, and other marketplaces through the CarOffer website within the applicable period. Transactions consists of each unique vehicle (based on vehicle identification number) that reaches \"sold and invoiced\" status on the CarOffer website within the applicable period, including vehicles sold to car dealers, vehicles sold at third-party auctions, vehicles ultimately sold to a different buyer, and vehicles that are returned to their owners without completion of a sale transaction. We exclude vehicles processed within CarOffer's intra-group trading solution (Group Trade) from the definition of Transactions, and we only count any unique vehicle once even if it reaches sold status multiple times. Digital Wholesale includes the purchase and sale of vehicles between dealers, or Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, and Sell My Car - Instant Max Cash Offer transactions. We view Transactions as a key business metric, and we believe it provides useful information to investors, because it provides insight into growth and revenue for the Digital Wholesale segment. Transactions drive a significant portion of Digital Wholesale segment revenue. We believe growth in Transactions demonstrates consumer and dealer utilization and our market share penetration in the Digital Wholesale segment.\n\nHistorically, we have used data from Google Analytics to measure two of our key business metrics: monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Effective July 1, 2024, GA4 replaced Google Analytics. The methodologies used in GA4 are different and not comparable to the methodologies used in Google Analytics. As discussed below, we also make certain adjustments to the GA4 data in order to improve the accuracy of the reported monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Due to this change in methodology, we are unable to provide comparable monthly unique user and monthly session information for prior periods, including any periods prior to June 30, 2024.\n\nFor each of our websites (excluding the CarOffer website), we define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited any such website and taken a visitor action (as defined below) within a calendar month, based on data as measured by GA4. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users of each of our websites in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, we count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses any of our websites or application during a calendar month and takes an action on such website or in such application, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer (a \"visitor action\"). If an individual accesses a website or application using a different device within a given month, the first visitor action taken by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual uses multiple browsers on a single device and/or clears their cookies and returns to our website or application and takes a visitor action within a calendar month, each such visitor action is counted as a separate unique user. We eliminate any duplicate unique users that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because our marketplace revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer’s website or map directions to the dealership.\n\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites (excluding the CarOffer website) that include a visitor action that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by GA4. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, a session is defined as beginning with the first visitor action from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window or after 30 minutes of inactivity. We eliminate any duplicate monthly sessions that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We believe that measuring the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an important indicator to us of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because the more satisfied and engaged consumers we have, the more valuable our service is to dealers.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTY2NyM2NTcwMTI2IzIwODEwODM=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MzJmZDU1ZWEtNDhjNC00NjNlLWJhNjgtMWY2NjVhMzlhZTMxLTEwOTI2NTQ=/tiny/CarGurus-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/eb5c3334-b347-4bd8-a757-c918e998a8e1/small/cargurus-digital-color-registered-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/eb5c3334-b347-4bd8-a757-c918e998a8e1)\n\nSource: CarGurus, Inc.\n\n**Kirndeep Singh** VP, Head of Investor Relations investors@cargurus.com\n\n## Connect with us:\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cargurus) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cargurus) [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/cargurus/) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/cargurus) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cargurus/) [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cargurus)\n\n  * United States (EN)\n\n    * [United States (EN) ](https://www.cargurus.com/?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Estados Unidos (ES) ](https://www.cargurus.com/es?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Canada (EN) ](https://ca.cargurus.com/?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [Canada (FR) ](https://ca.cargurus.com/fr?pid=countryPicker)\n    * [United Kingdom ](https://www.cargurus.co.uk/?pid=countryPicker)\n\n\n\n"
