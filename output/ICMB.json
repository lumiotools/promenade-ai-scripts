          "content": "Investcorp’s full year results for the fiscal year ended 30\nJune 2022\nSolid performance across all business lines delivers a 9% increase in net profit attributable\nto the equity holders of the parent to US$ 135 million\nContinued growth in Assets Under Management (AUM) to a record high of US$ 42.7 billion,\ndriven by strong demand for Investcorp’s product offerings\nInvestcorp has released its fiscal year results for the twelve months ended 30 June 2022 (FY22). The\nfull set of financial statements are available on Investcorp’s website at www.investcorp.com.\nInvestcorp’s FY22 results were driven by good levels of activity across the core businesses of private\nequity, real estate, credit management and absolute return investments. This resulted in delivering a\nnet profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent of US$ 135 million compared to US$ 124\nmillion in FY21.\nTotal shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interest) as of June 30, 2022 increased 3% to\nUS$ 1,314 million (FY21: US$ 1,270 million) and total assets were US$ 2,295 million (FY21:\nUS$ 2,391 million). The FY22 recommendation for distribution of preferred and ordinary dividends is\nUS$ 57 million in aggregate (including interim dividends on preference shares), with the proposed\nordinary dividend being US$ 0.30 per share.\nFinancial and operational highlights\n• Continued progress on strategy to drive greater recurring fee revenues and enhance earnings\nprofile. AUM fees, transaction and advisory income of US$ 411 million increased by 15%\ncompared to US$ 356 million in FY21. Recurring AUM fees of US$ 240 million grew by 11%\ncompared to US$ 217 million in FY21, reflecting a higher level of client assets under\nmanagement and strong fundraising during the year. Transaction and advisory income of US$\n171 million grew by 23% compared to US$ 139 million in FY21, driven primarily by good levels\nof transactional and fundraising activity and performance of the underlying assets under\nmanagement.\n• AUM grew to a record high of US$ 42.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to US$ 37.6 billion\nas of June 30, 2021, driven by the broad-based diversification of the franchise across\ngeographies, clients, and products.\n• Asset-based income from co-investment business and others of US$ 109 million for FY22\nwas up 2% compared to US$ 107 million in FY21. The results reflect good performance of\nthe underlying investments across all asset classes.\n• Activity metrics were solid with investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion (FY 21: US$ 3.3 billion),\ntotal fundraising of US$ 7.4 billion (FY 21: US$ 4.3 billion) and distributions of US$ 4.5 billion\n(FY21: US$ 3.0 billion).\n• Investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion includes US$ 1.2 billion for private equity and strategic\ncapital, US$ 1.2 billion for real estate, US$ 2.4 billion for various CLOs and US$ 120 million\ninto an insurance business in the U.S. providing fixed annuities. Private equity investments\nincluded five new investments in the US and Europe and four new investments in Asia.\n• Exit activities included the full realization of eight private equity investments in the US, Europe\nand MENA, the partial realization of one private equity investment in the US, and the sale of\nmultiple real estate properties in the US and Europe, including the first exit from Investcorp’s\nEuropean (ex-UK) portfolio with the sale of Bürocampus Wangen in Stuttgart, Germany.\n• Total fundraising reached a record high of US$ 7.4 billion raised across private and\ninstitutional clients for new deal-by-deal offerings, fund products and SPAC IPOs, as well as\nthe pricing/issuance and resets of several CLOs.\n• As of June 30, 2022, total equity (excluding non-controlling interests) was US$ 1,314 million\nand total accessible liquidity was US$ 1.3 billion. The increase in equity (excluding non-\ncontrolling interests) is largely due to the strong results for the year partially offset by the\npayment of FY21 dividends and purchase of treasury shares during the year.\n• The size of the balance sheet decreased by 4% to US$ 2.3 billion from US$ 2.4 billion as a\nresult of strong business and fundraising activities which translated into lower underwriting\nand lower working capital that was partially offset by fair value gains and higher co-investment\nbalances in line with the AUM growth as new products/offering are launched.\n• Net debt declined to US$ 353 million in FY22 from US$ 443 million in FY21. The improved\nnet debt position together with a high level of equity and liquidity puts the balance sheet in a\nstrong position heading into the next fiscal year.\nInvestcorp also continued to make progress on a number of key strategic initiatives:\n• Successfully concluded the Firm’s first Murabaha facility which was oversubscribed with a\nfinal participation of US$ 440 million.\n• Successfully sponsored the IPOs of two SPACs, one focused on European investments and\none focused on Indian investments. Both SPACs are listed on NASDAQ. The gross proceeds\nfrom both offerings were in excess of US$ 600 million and were heavily oversubscribed. The\nsuccessful IPOs reflect the confidence of market participants in Investcorp as an institutional\nsponsor and are a testament to Investcorp’s history and track record in acquiring good\nbusinesses and helping them deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders.\n• Announced the launch of eLydian Lion 1, the first dedicated institutional blockchain and\nShariah-compliant fund based in the GCC, with a global investment mandate. The Fund –\nwhich will be led from Investcorp’s Abu Dhabi office – is expected to be deployed globally and\nwill focus on investments in companies leading the next digital evolution driven by blockchain\ntechnology.\n• Launched a private infrastructure investment business in North America. The new platform\nwill apply the Firm’s global expertise and track record in real estate and private equity to make\ninvestments in critical infrastructure companies and projects across North America.\n• Held the final close of the Investcorp Strategic Capital Partners Fund with capital\ncommitments of US$ 620 million.\n• Led a US$ 55 million investment in NDR Warehousing Private Limited, one of the largest\nIndian warehousing platforms. This was the first India domestic fundraising by the Firm, which\nwas anchored by BAE.\n• Released its 2021 Responsible Business Report. The report includes Investcorp’s\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) highlights for 2021 and specific initiatives the\nFirm implemented to meet its goals, as well as some case studies illustrating areas where the\nfirm has demonstrated its commitment to responsibility as a core component of its values and\nculture. The full report is available on the website: https://www.investcorp.com/esg/\n• Announced the growth of its footprint in the United States with the opening of its Los Angeles\noffice. As part of the expansion, Scott Goldchain was hired as a senior relationship manager\nin charge of the West Coast who will be responsible for growing the firm’s LP relationships in\nthe region.\n• Announced the formation of a new venture to acquire industrial real estate assets in the\nUnited States, in partnership with two leading sovereign wealth funds.\n• Launched the Investcorp Insurance Solutions platform, the firm’s newly formed business that\nwill focus on providing investment management services to meet the unique investment\nneeds of insurers.\n• Launched a Saudi focused Pre-IPO Growth Fund, dedicated to investing in a diversified\nportfolio of companies at a “pre-IPO” stage of development in Saudi Arabia.\n• The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced that it will anchor the Aberdeen\nStandard Investcorp Infrastructure Partners’ (ASIIP) new regional fund by committing US$ 90\nmillion to its first close.

Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent of $135 million was 9% higher\nthan the prior fiscal year (FY21).

Operating expenses increased by 17% to $338 million (FY21:\n$290 million) in line with the growth in gross operating income.\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income has two components: (i) AUM fees which include management and\nadministrative fees on aggregate client investments under management in PE, RE and SC deals, all fees from\nclient investments in ARI and CM as well as placement fees earned on PE and RE investments from program\nclients; and (ii) Transaction and advisory income which are generated and earned from transactional activities in\nconnection with PE or RE acquisitions. Activity fees also includes part of the placement fees earned by the Group\nfrom clients (excluding placements with program clients) and eventual exit fees, plus performance fees on PE, RE\nand SC assets under management (AUM) for value added during the ownership period, and income from SPACs.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS | 20\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nSummary of fees ($ millions) FY22 FY21 % Change H/(L)\nPE fees 91 91 -\nCM fees 65 59 10%\nRE fees 49 35 40%\nSC fees 13 7 86%\nOther management fees 22 25 (12%)\nAUM Fees 240 217 11%\nPE investment 84 77 9%\nRE investment 64 61 5%\nSPAC income 22 - n.m.\nCM investment 1 1 -\nTransaction and advisory income 171 139 23%\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income 411 356 15%\nTotal AUM fees, transaction and advisory income in FY22 increased to $411 million (FY21: $356 million).\nAUM fees were $240 million in FY22, 11% higher than FY21.

Other expenses, comprising professional fees, travel and\nbusiness development, administration and infrastructure costs and non-compensation personnel costs such as\ntraining and recruitment increased by 18% to $91 million as compared to $77 million for the same period last year.\nThis is primarily due to an increase in travel and other discretionary expenses as travel restrictions imposed due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic started to ease as well as the generally increasing costs as markets have re-opened\naround the world and inflationary pressures are rising globally.\nOperating expenses ($ millions) FY22 FY21 Change H/(L)\nStaff compensation 225 199 26\nOther personnel costs and charges 22 14 8\nOther operating expenses 91 77 14\nTotal operating expenses 338 290 48\nFull time employees (‘FTE’) at end of period 486 427 59\nStaff compensation per FTE (‘000) 463 466 (1%)\nTotal staff compensation / total operating expenses 67% 69% (2%)\nCost-to-income(a) 69% 68% 1%\n(a) Operating expenses / Net revenue.

The affirmation also reflects the vulnerability of Investcorp's business model to a market downturn\nand Fitch's view of the firm's ability to maintain credit metrics in line with expectations.\n“Rating constraints include the firm's increased earnings volatility and placement risk relative to peers, given its\nbusiness model of offering investments to clients on a fully underwritten deal-by-deal basis and its sizable co-\ninvestment portfolio, which is subject to fair value changes. Activity fees, which are earned from transactional\nactivities and have comprised almost half of Investcorp's core fees over the past several years, are also susceptible\nto market volatility.”2\nIn November 2021, Moody’s affirmed Investcorp’s credit ratings at Ba2, and ‘Negative’ outlook. “The rating reflects\nthe company's solid market position in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region as a leading alternative\ninvestment provider, its global franchise, healthy operating margin and good asset retention.\n“Furthermore, Investcorp's level of assets under management (AUM) and liquidity are expected to remain resilient,\nand the company has a significant amount of loss-absorbing equity capital which counters its elevated balance\nsheet risk. The rating and its associated negative outlook also reflects our expectation that Investcorp group's gross\ndebt / adjusted EBITDA will remain elevated as the company seeks to diversify its funding sources.”3\nEquity\nEquity ($ millions) Jun-22 Jun-21 Change H/(L)\nOrdinary shareholders’ equity 895 854 41\nPreference share capital 375 375 -\nProposed appropriations 52 44 8\nOther reserves (8) (3) (5)\nNon-controlling interests 1 2 (1)\nNet book equity 1,315 1,272 43\nNet equity as of June 30, 2022 remained stable at $1.3 billion.

The\nincrease in total client AUM in FY22 is largely attributable to the 34% increase in real estate client AUM to $8.3\nbillion from $6.2 billion. This increase is largely due to the acquisition and placement of various new portfolios and\nfundraising for the new Industrial Real Estate Venture. Credit management client AUM increased by 11% to $15.7\nbillion from $14.2 billion largely due to the issuance/pricing of several CLOs. The growth in credit management\nclient AUM has been somewhat offset by the devaluation of the EUR versus the USD during the year.
