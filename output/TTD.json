The Trade Desk will partner with smart TV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other streaming TV aggregators to deploy Ventura. \n\nVentura represents a major advance in streaming TV operating systems as it solves key issues with prevailing market systems today, including frustrating user experiences, inefficient advertising supply chains, and content conflicts-of-interest. \n\nThe major benefits of Ventura include: \n\n  * A more intuitive, engaging user experience, including cross-platform content discovery, personalization, subscription management, and ultimately fewer (more relevant) ads. \n  * A much cleaner supply chain for streaming TV advertising, minimizing supply chain hops and costs – ensuring maximum ROI for every advertising dollar and optimized yield for publishers. \n  * Incorporating advances such as OpenPath and Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), Ventura will enable advertisers to value and price ad impressions across all streaming platforms more accurately, while finding relevant audiences with greater precision. \n\n\n\n“We’re at a point in the evolution of streaming TV where we must ensure the supply chain of streaming TV advertising is competitive and transparent, so advertisers can maximize campaign performance, publishers can fund this new golden age of TV, and consumers have a better streaming TV ad experience,” said Jeff Green, CEO and Founder, The Trade Desk. “This innovation has to come in the OS, and it has to come from a company that brings the objectivity of not owning any streaming TV content. At The Trade Desk, all we want is a fair marketplace, where supply chain costs are minimized, and advertiser trust can thrive.” \n\nVentura comes as more [consumers](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nbcnews.com%252Fbusiness%252Fconsumer%252Fstreaming-surpassed-cable-americas-watched-viewing-platform-rcna95313%26data%3D05%257C02%257Cmelinda.zurich%2540thetradedesk.com%257C5e1b517ea0ea46744d2c08dd07e4d8e5%257C0332caae1d474d12bc4dc39a8c4fd280%257C0%257C0%257C638675401665056948%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3DoRR6tsIHcAws%252FMPHXLidsGq2CW7JQNIVrpWXUHgxGag%253D%26reserved%3D0&esheet=54155715&newsitemid=20241120619659&lan=en-US&anchor=consumers&index=1&md5=521122f93ab7caad97ac37c0b0d84fd8) use streaming platforms than traditional cable TV; as almost every major media company has [launched](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.adweek.com%252Fconvergent-tv%252Fad-supported-streaming%252F%26data%3D05%257C02%257Cmelinda.zurich%2540thetradedesk.com%257C5e1b517ea0ea46744d2c08dd07e4d8e5%257C0332caae1d474d12bc4dc39a8c4fd280%257C0%257C0%257C638675401665085703%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3Dmd3%252F8%252FwMNcSqOVBCqCL76%252BoKmIWPKVgNnDaCi7LR%252BbA%253D%26reserved%3D0&esheet=54155715&newsitemid=20241120619659&lan=en-US&anchor=launched&index=2&md5=1e30909dbb2b7882cd90e5af2bbef957) an ad-supported streaming option for viewers; and as more and more companies [enter](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thedrum.com%252Fnews%252F2024%252F08%252F06%252Fretail-media-s-next-frontier-travel-transport-just-ask-expedia-united-uber%26data%3D05%257C02%257Cmelinda.zurich%2540thetradedesk.com%257C5e1b517ea0ea46744d2c08dd07e4d8e5%257C0332caae1d474d12bc4dc39a8c4fd280%257C0%257C0%257C638675401665099201%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3DuhlhwFsF7d4RJcRIeyzj2cN31ZpSyoNcCIHRz4O58CU%253D%26reserved%3D0&esheet=54155715&newsitemid=20241120619659&lan=en-US&anchor=enter&index=3&md5=4ff257b83cdd38677a1798954dbdaf7a) the streaming content aggregation business. \n\n“Everyone from OEMs to airlines and hotel chains are now in the streaming TV aggregation business, and they’re all trying to figure out the advertising business model while improving the viewer experience,” said Matthew Henick, SVP Ventura, The Trade Desk. “With our content objectivity and our scaled streaming TV advertising demand, The Trade Desk is uniquely positioned to drive innovation at this key moment.” \n\n** Industry Support **\n\nThe Trade Desk expects that Ventura will be deployed by OEMs and other streaming TV aggregators as early as 2025.

(“The Trade Desk,” the “Company” or “we”) (NASDAQ: TTD), a provider of a global technology platform for buyers of advertising, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“The Trade Desk delivered strong performance in the third quarter, with revenue of $628 million, accelerating growth to 27%. This performance underlines the value that advertisers are placing on precision and transparency as they work with us to maximize the impact of their campaigns,” said Jeff Green, Co-founder and CEO of The Trade Desk. “As we enter our busiest time of year and look ahead to 2025, we have never been in a better position to capture greater share of the $1 trillion advertising TAM. 2024 has been a banner year for CTV. Many of the largest media companies are now working with us to help clients capture the full value of CTV advertising via programmatic. We are similarly excited about the momentum in retail media and the pace of adoption by advertisers who are taking advantage of our retail data marketplace. And the performance improvements that our clients are seeing with Kokai - our largest platform upgrade to date - showcase the value of audience-driven, AI-enabled innovation.” \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: **\n\nThe following table summarizes our unaudited consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in millions, except per share amounts): \n\n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**GAAP Results**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  628  |  $  |  493  |  $  |  1,704  |  $  |  1,340   \nIncrease in revenue year over year  |  27  |  %  |  25  |  %  |  27  |  %  |  23  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  94  |  $  |  39  |  $  |  211  |  $  |  82   \nNet income margin  |  15  |  %  |  8  |  %  |  12  |  %  |  6  |  %   \nGAAP diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  0.19  |  $  |  0.08  |  $  |  0.42  |  $  |  0.16   \n**Non-GAAP Results**  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  257  |  $  |  200  |  $  |  661  |  $  |  488   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  41  |  %  |  40  |  %  |  39  |  %  |  36  |  %   \nNon-GAAP net income  |  $  |  207  |  $  |  167  |  $  |  536  |  $  |  421   \nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  0.41  |  $  |  0.33  |  $  |  1.07  |  $  |  0.84   \n  \n** Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights: **\n\n  * **Strong Customer Retention:** Customer retention remained over 95% during the third quarter, as it has for the past ten consecutive years. \n  * **Continued Collaboration and Support for Unified ID 2.0:** The Trade Desk is building support for Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), an industry-wide approach to identity that preserves the value of relevant advertising, while putting user control and privacy at the forefront. UID2 is an upgrade and alternative to third-party cookies. Recent partnerships and pledges of integration and support include: \n    * Spotify is extending its partnership with The Trade Desk, piloting integrations with OpenPath and UID2 through Spotify Ad Exchange. \n    * Roku announced its adoption of UID2, allowing advertisers to implement more precise targeting and a secure means to facilitate data collaboration with Roku Media. \n    * Reach, a UK news publisher of 130 media brands, is adopting EUID as part of their commitment to protecting journalism with a best-in-class advertising experience for readers. \n    * Global media company Motorsport Network announced adoption of EUID to provide relevant advertising while prioritizing consumer privacy and transparency for its 60 million authenticated users. \n    * Cint announced integration of UID2 to provide robust, omnichannel brand lift measurement. \n  * **Industry Recognition (2024):**\n    * Institutional Investor Awards - Most Honored Company, Best CEO, Best Company Board, Best IR Program, Best IR Professional, Best IR Team, Best Analyst Day \n    * U.S. News & World Report Best Company to Work For \n    * Business Insider Rising Stars of Adtech \n    * AdExchanger Top Women in Media & Ad Tech \n    * MM+M 40 under 40 \n    * Retail TouchPoints 40 under 40 \n  * **Share Repurchases:** The Company repurchased $54 million of its Class A common stock in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $521 million available and authorized for repurchases. \n\n\n\n** Financial Guidance: **\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 outlook summary: \n\n  * Revenue at least $756 million \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $363 million \n\n\n\nWe have not provided an outlook for GAAP net income or reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income, the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, because net income outlook is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges included in the calculation of this non-GAAP measure; in particular, the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation expense that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results. \n\n** Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information **\n\nIncluded within this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) that supplement the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of The Trade Desk, Inc. (the Company) prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; interest income, net; and provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA margin’s closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is net income margin, which is GAAP net income divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income excludes charges and the related income tax effects for stock-based compensation. Tax rates on the tax-deductible portions of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 25% to 30% have been used in the computation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company's management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance, and cash-generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Webcast and Conference Call Details **\n\n  * **When:** November 7, 2024 at 2:00 P.M.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that (a) are not historical facts, (b) predict or forecast future events or results, or (c) embody assumptions that may prove to have been inaccurate, including statements relating to industry and market trends, the Company’s financial targets, such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. When words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “will,” “outlook” or similar expressions are used, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot give readers any assurance that such expectations will prove correct. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the Company’s relatively limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate the Company’s business and prospects, the market for programmatic advertising developing slower or differently than the Company’s expectations, the demands and expectations of clients and the ability to attract and retain clients. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These are disclosed in the Company’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent filings on Forms 10-Q or 8-K, available at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54148973&newsitemid=20241107931247&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=6&md5=c464dfdb2da77f41714545e3ae66839b). Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company does not intend to update any forward-looking statement contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof. \n\n**THE TRADE DESK, INC.**

This performance underlines the value that advertisers are placing on precision and transparency as they work with us to maximize the impact of their campaigns,” said Jeff Green, Co-founder and CEO of The Trade Desk. “As we enter our busiest time of year and look ahead to 2025, we have never been in a better position to capture greater share of the $1 trillion advertising TAM. 2024 has been a banner year for CTV. Many of the largest media companies are now working with us to help clients capture the full value of CTV advertising via programmatic. We are similarly excited about the momentum in retail media and the pace of adoption by advertisers who are taking advantage of our retail data marketplace. And the performance improvements that our clients are seeing with Kokai - our largest platform upgrade to date - showcase the value of audience-driven, AI-enabled innovation.” \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: **\n\nThe following table summarizes our unaudited consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in millions, except per share amounts): \n\n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**GAAP Results**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  628  |  $  |  493  |  $  |  1,704  |  $  |  1,340   \nIncrease in revenue year over year  |  27  |  %  |  25  |  %  |  27  |  %  |  23  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  94  |  $  |  39  |  $  |  211  |  $  |  82   \nNet income margin  |  15  |  %  |  8  |  %  |  12  |  %  |  6  |  %   \nGAAP diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  0.19  |  $  |  0.08  |  $  |  0.42  |  $  |  0.16   \n**Non-GAAP Results**  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  257  |  $  |  200  |  $  |  661  |  $  |  488   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin  |  41  |  %  |  40  |  %  |  39  |  %  |  36  |  %   \nNon-GAAP net income  |  $  |  207  |  $  |  167  |  $  |  536  |  $  |  421   \nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  0.41  |  $  |  0.33  |  $  |  1.07  |  $  |  0.84   \n  \n** Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights: **\n\n  * **Strong Customer Retention:** Customer retention remained over 95% during the third quarter, as it has for the past ten consecutive years. \n  * **Continued Collaboration and Support for Unified ID 2.0:** The Trade Desk is building support for Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), an industry-wide approach to identity that preserves the value of relevant advertising, while putting user control and privacy at the forefront. UID2 is an upgrade and alternative to third-party cookies. Recent partnerships and pledges of integration and support include: \n    * Spotify is extending its partnership with The Trade Desk, piloting integrations with OpenPath and UID2 through Spotify Ad Exchange. \n    * Roku announced its adoption of UID2, allowing advertisers to implement more precise targeting and a secure means to facilitate data collaboration with Roku Media. \n    * Reach, a UK news publisher of 130 media brands, is adopting EUID as part of their commitment to protecting journalism with a best-in-class advertising experience for readers. \n    * Global media company Motorsport Network announced adoption of EUID to provide relevant advertising while prioritizing consumer privacy and transparency for its 60 million authenticated users. \n    * Cint announced integration of UID2 to provide robust, omnichannel brand lift measurement. \n  * **Industry Recognition (2024):**\n    * Institutional Investor Awards - Most Honored Company, Best CEO, Best Company Board, Best IR Program, Best IR Professional, Best IR Team, Best Analyst Day \n    * U.S. News & World Report Best Company to Work For \n    * Business Insider Rising Stars of Adtech \n    * AdExchanger Top Women in Media & Ad Tech \n    * MM+M 40 under 40 \n    * Retail TouchPoints 40 under 40 \n  * **Share Repurchases:** The Company repurchased $54 million of its Class A common stock in the third quarter of 2024.

We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results. \n\n** Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information **\n\nIncluded within this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) that supplement the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of The Trade Desk, Inc. (the Company) prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; interest income, net; and provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA margin’s closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is net income margin, which is GAAP net income divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income excludes charges and the related income tax effects for stock-based compensation. Tax rates on the tax-deductible portions of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 25% to 30% have been used in the computation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company's management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance, and cash-generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Webcast and Conference Call Details **\n\n  * **When:** November 7, 2024 at 2:00 P.M.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that (a) are not historical facts, (b) predict or forecast future events or results, or (c) embody assumptions that may prove to have been inaccurate, including statements relating to industry and market trends, the Company’s financial targets, such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. When words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “will,” “outlook” or similar expressions are used, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot give readers any assurance that such expectations will prove correct. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the Company’s relatively limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate the Company’s business and prospects, the market for programmatic advertising developing slower or differently than the Company’s expectations, the demands and expectations of clients and the ability to attract and retain clients. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These are disclosed in the Company’s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent filings on Forms 10-Q or 8-K, available at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54148973&newsitemid=20241107931247&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=6&md5=c464dfdb2da77f41714545e3ae66839b). Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company does not intend to update any forward-looking statement contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof. \n\n**THE TRADE DESK, INC.**

(the “Company”) is a global technology company that empowers buyers of advertising. Through the Company’s self-service,\ncloud-based platform, ad buyers can create, manage and optimize more expressive data-driven digital advertising campaigns across ad formats and channels,\nincluding video (which includes connected television (“CTV”)), display, audio, digital-out-of-home, native and social, on a multitude of devices, such as\ncomputers, mobile devices, televisions and streaming devices. The Company’s platform integrations with major inventory, publisher and data partners provide\nad buyers reach and decisioning capabilities, and the Company’s enterprise application programming interfaces (“APIs”) enable its clients to customize and\nexpand platform functionality.\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation formed in November 2009 and headquartered in Ventura, California with offices in various cities in North\nAmerica, Europe, Asia and Australia.\nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023\nwas derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in its Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s accounting policies from those disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, and these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with that used to\nprepare the Company’s audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and include, in the opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for the fair statement of the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full\nyear ending December 31, 2024.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nManagement regularly evaluates its estimates, primarily those related to: (1) revenue recognition criteria, including the determination of revenue\nreporting as net versus gross in the Company’s revenue arrangements, (2) allowances for credit losses, (3) operating lease assets and liabilities, including the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate and terms and provisions of each lease, (4) the useful lives of property and equipment and capitalized software\ndevelopment costs, (5) income taxes, (6) assumptions used in the option pricing models to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and (7) the\nrecognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that\nmanagement believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the impacts to the Company’s business due to geopolitical developments and macroeconomic factors such as changes in\ninterest and foreign currency exchange rates, inflation and supply chain disruptions, continue to evolve. As a result, many of the Company’s estimates and\nassumptions, including the allowance for credit losses, consider macroeconomic factors in the market, which require increased judgment and carry a higher\ndegree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, the Company’s estimates may change materially\nin future periods.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which adds requirements to report significant expenses, requirements for entities with a single reportable segment to provide\nall disclosures otherwise required under Topic 280 and requirements to report segment information on an interim basis, among other clarifications and\nrequirements. This guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and interim periods beginning with the Company’s Quarterly Report Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31,\n2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance beginning with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\n31, 2024, and the Company expects the guidance to result in additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for its single reportable\nsegment that were previously not applicable. The Company will continue to evaluate the disclosure requirements through the end of fiscal year 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires greater\ndisaggregation of information and consistent categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also\nincludes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This guidance will be effective on a prospective basis, with an\noption to apply it retrospectively, for annual periods beginning with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025.\nEarly adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and notes.\nNote 3—Earnings Per Share\nThe Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders for\nClass A and Class B common stock were the same because they were entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted\nearnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the potentially\ndilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), using the two-class method required for participating\nsecurities. Restricted stock awards are considered to be participating securities due to their non-forfeitable dividend rights.\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 94,158 $ 39,352 $ 210,847 $ 81,617\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding—basic 491,614 489,447 489,845 489,195\nEffect of dilutive securities 10,949 12,433 10,428 11,153\nWeighted-average shares outstanding—diluted 502,563 501,880 500,273 500,348\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.19 $ 0.08 $ 0.43 $ 0.17\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.19 $ 0.08 $ 0.42 $ 0.16\nAnti-dilutive equity awards under stock-based award plans excluded\nfrom the determination of diluted earnings per share 2,667 4,916 2,667 4,916\n8\nTable of Contents\nNote 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments, Net\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in marketable securities were as follows (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nCash and\nCash Short-Term\nEquivalents Investments, Net Total\nCash $ 245,126 $ — $ 245,126\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds 934,535 — 934,535\nLevel 2:\nCommercial paper 41,814 140,141 181,955\nCorporate debt securities — 240,285 240,285\nU.S. government and agency securities — 129,864 129,864\nTotal $ 1,221,475 $ 510,290 $ 1,731,765\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCash and\nCash Short-Term\nEquivalents Investments, Net Total\nCash $ 289,512 $ — $ 289,512\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds 560,673 — 560,673\nLevel 2:\nCommercial paper 36,013 168,224 204,237\nCorporate debt securities — 185,465 185,465\nU.S. government and agency securities 8,931 131,470 140,401\nTotal $ 895,129 $ 485,159 $ 1,380,288\nThe Company’s gross unrealized gains and losses from its short-term investments, recorded at fair value, for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, were immaterial.\nThe contractual maturities of the Company’s short-term investments are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nDue in one year $ 471,030\nDue in one to two years 39,260\nTotal $ 510,290\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 5—Leases\nThe components of lease expense recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 15,062 $ 12,532 $ 41,259 $ 36,588\nShort-term lease cost 666 493 1,554 1,407\nVariable lease cost 4,255 3,253 11,863 9,207\nSublease income — (619) (42) (1,769)\nTotal lease cost $ 19,983 $ 15,659 $ 54,634 $ 45,433\nNote 6—Debt\nCredit Facility\nOn June 15, 2021, the Company and a syndicate of banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement\n(the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility consists of a $450 million revolving loan facility, with a $20 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $15\nmillion sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, the Company has the right to increase the Credit Facility by an amount not to\nexceed $300 million. The Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets, including a pledge of certain of its accounts receivable,\ndeposit accounts, intellectual property, investment property and equipment.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company amended the Credit Facility to expand the process for issuing letters of credit and the related invoicing,\nparticularly with respect to letters of credit not denominated in U.S. Dollars. On February 9, 2023, the Company further amended its Credit Facility (as\namended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to transition from a variable interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate to a variable interest rate based\non the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”).\nLoans under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, an annual rate of either a Base Rate or an adjusted\nterm SOFR rate (defined as SOFR for a specified term plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points, subject to a 0% floor), plus an applicable margin\n(“Base Rate Borrowings” and “Term SOFR Borrowings”). The Base Rate is defined as a rate per annum for any day equal to the greatest of (1) the rate of\ninterest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the United States, (2) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate in effect on such day plus\nhalf of 1%, and (3) the adjusted term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period on such day plus 1%. The applicable margin is between 0.25% to 1.25% for\nBase Rate Borrowings and between 1.25% and 2.25% for Term SOFR Borrowings based on the Company maintaining certain leverage ratios. The fee for\nundrawn amounts under the Amended Credit Facility ranges, based on the applicable leverage, from 0.200% to 0.350%. The Company is also required to pay\ncustomary letter of credit fees, as necessary.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have an outstanding debt balance under the Amended Credit Facility. Availability under the Amended\nCredit Facility was $442 million as of September 30, 2024, which is net of outstanding letters of credit of $8 million. The Amended Credit Facility matures,\nand all outstanding amounts become due and payable, on June 15, 2026.\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict the\nCompany’s ability to sell assets, make changes to the nature of the Company’s business, engage in mergers or acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist\nadditional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay dividends, issue equity instruments, make distributions or redeem or repurchase\ncapital stock or make other investments, engage in transactions with affiliates and make payments in respect of subordinated debt. The Amended Credit Facility\nalso requires the Company to maintain compliance with a maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of 3.50 to 1.00. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\n10\nTable of Contents\nNote 7—Capitalization\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $700 million of its\nClass A common stock. As of December 31, 2023, $53 million remained available and authorized for repurchases. In February 2024, an additional $647 million\nwas authorized under this program, bringing the total amount available for future repurchases back to $700 million. The share repurchase program, which has\nno expiration date, is designed to help offset the impact of future share dilution from employee stock issuances. Repurchases under the program may be made\nin the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at the Company’s discretion,\ndepending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases are structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws,\nincluding within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The\nCompany may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. This program does not\nobligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion\nof the Company’s board of directors.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 0.5 million shares of its Class A common\nstock for an aggregate repurchase amount of $54 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently\nretired 2 million shares of its Class A common stock for an aggregate repurchase amount of $179 million. The repurchase amounts included in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of stockholders’ equity included immaterial amounts related to the 1% excise tax on share repurchases, net of share issuances, as a\nresult of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). As of September 30, 2024, $521 million remained available and authorized for repurchases. Activity\nunder the share repurchase program was recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements on a trade-date basis.\nNote 8—Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPlatform operations $ 7,617 $ 5,729 $ 20,444 $ 14,642\nSales and marketing 25,294 21,116 70,654 54,039\nTechnology and development 36,958 43,727 97,441 91,283\nGeneral and administrative 58,641 69,061 176,931 210,222\nTotal $ 128,510 $ 139,633 $ 365,470 $ 370,186\nOn September 30, 2023, David R. Pickles stepped down as the Company’s Chief Technology Officer and from the Company’s board of directors. As a\nresult, Mr. Pickles and the Company mutually agreed to cancel his unvested stock options and restricted stock without payment or replacement, resulting in the\nrecognition of $14 million in incremental stock-based compensation expense, which is included in technology and development expense for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. No amount of stock-based compensation expense for these cancelled options and restricted stock remained unamortized.\n11\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nThe following summarizes stock option activity, excluding the CEO Performance Option (as defined below):\nShares Weighted-\nUnder Options Average\n(in thousands) Exercise Price\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 12,258 $ 31.05\nGranted 2,419 82.23\nExercised (3,002) 26.57\nExpired/Forfeited (455) 64.95\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 11,220 $ 41.91\nExercisable as of September 30, 2024 7,274 $ 24.91\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation relating to stock options, excluding the CEO Performance\nOption, of approximately $155 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.\nCEO Performance Option\nIn October 2021, the Company granted a market-based performance award to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Performance\nOption”) under the Company’s 2016 Incentive Award Plan. The CEO Performance Option has an exercise price of $68.29 per share. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe CEO Performance Option had 19.2 million options outstanding. No options were granted, forfeited or expired during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 0.7 million options were exercised at an exercise price of $68.29. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the CEO Performance Option had 1.7 million exercisable options and 18.5 million options outstanding.\nStock-based compensation of $30 million and $48 million for the CEO Performance Option was recorded as a component of general and\nadministrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation of $102 million and $156 million\nfor the CEO Performance Option was recorded as a component of general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation relating to the CEO Performance Option of $99\nmillion that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years, assuming no acceleration of vesting.\nRestricted Stock\nThe following summarizes restricted stock activity:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nShares Grant Date\n(in thousands) Fair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 10,546 $ 62.22\nGranted 4,493 83.90\nVested (3,233) 61.41\nForfeited (840) 66.28\nUnvested as of September 30, 2024 10,966 $ 71.03\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation relating to restricted stock of approximately $725 million,\nwhich is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\nStock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $7 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Stock-based\ncompensation expense related to the ESPP was $20 million and $15 million for\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation\nrelating to ESPP awards of approximately $7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.5 years.\nNote 9—Income Taxes\nIn determining the interim provision for income taxes for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nutilized the annual estimated effective tax rate applied to the actual year-to-date income and added the tax effects of any discrete items in the reporting period in\nwhich they occur.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes included benefits associated with stock-based awards of $14\nmillion and $9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for income taxes included benefits associated with\nstock-based awards of $43 million and $45 million, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate differed from the United States federal statutory tax rate of\n21% primarily due to nondeductible stock-based compensation and state and foreign taxes, partially offset by the impact of tax benefits associated with stock-\nbased awards and research and development tax credits.\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the Company\ndoes not expect to have any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits through the end of the fiscal year.\nNote 10—Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company has one primary business activity and operates in one reportable and operating segment.\nThe Company reports revenue net of amounts it pays suppliers for the cost of advertising inventory, third-party data and other add-on features\n(collectively, “Supplier Features”). The Company generally bills clients based on the gross amount of Supplier Features they purchase through its platform, and\nfor platform fees, value-added services and platform features (“Gross Billings”), net of allowances. The Company’s accounts receivable are recorded at the\namount of Gross Billings for the amounts it is responsible to collect, and accounts payable are recorded at the net amount payable to suppliers. Accordingly,\nboth accounts receivable and accounts payable appear large in relation to revenue reported on a net basis.\nGross Billings, based on the address of the clients or client affiliates, set forth as a percentage of total Gross Billings, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States 88 % 87 % 88 % 88 %\nInternational 12 % 13 % 12 % 12 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nNote 11— Commitments and Contingencies\nGuarantees, Indemnification and Other\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to clients, vendors, lessors, business\npartners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided\nby the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements\nwith directors and certain officers and employees that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise\nby reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon the Company to provide indemnification under such\nagreements, and thus, there are no claims that the Company is aware of that could have a material effect on the Company’s balance sheet, statement of\noperations or statement of cash flows. Accordingly, no amounts for any obligation have been recorded at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company believes that the amount of losses or any estimable range\nof possible losses with respect to these matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business and condensed\nconsolidated financial statements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final\noutcome may be materially different from the Company’s expectations.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, litigation and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary\ncourse of business. Although the outcome of the various legal proceedings, litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not\nbelieve that any of these proceedings or other claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or\ncash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of\nmanagement resources and other factors.\nOn May 27, 2022, a stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit captioned Huizenga v. Green, et al., No. 2022-0461, asserting claims on behalf of the\nCompany against certain members of the Company’s board of directors in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On June 27, 2022, a second\nderivative lawsuit captioned Pfeiffer v. Green, et al., No. 2022-0560, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging substantially similar\nclaims. Those lawsuits were consolidated on August 18, 2022, and a lead plaintiff was appointed on October 7, 2022. The two complaints allege generally that\nthe defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the CEO Performance\nOption. The plaintiffs seek a court order rescinding the CEO Performance Option and monetary damages. On November 10, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a\nconsolidated complaint, and on January 12, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On March 24, 2023, plaintiffs filed an\nopposition to defendants’ motions to dismiss. Defendants filed their replies in support of their motions to dismiss on May 19, 2023. The court heard oral\nargument on the motions on April 3, 2024.\nOn October 4, 2024, a stockholder filed a class action complaint in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware alleging claims for breach of\ncontract against the Company and breach of fiduciary duties against the Company’s directors, in connection with the Company’s proposed reincorporation from\nDelaware to Nevada. Gunderson v. The Trade Desk, Inc., No. 2024-1029 (Del. Ch.). On October 24, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The\ncomplaint seeks, among other things, an order declaring that the Company’s proposed conversion requires approval by a supermajority of the Company’s\nstockholders and an order enjoining the November 14, 2024 stockholder vote on the proposed conversion. On October 28, 2024, the parties completed\nexpedited briefing on cross motions for summary judgment regarding the causes of action asserted in the original complaint, and the Court heard oral argument\non the motions on October 30, 2024. On November 6, 2024, the Court granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion and denied the plaintiff’s cross-\nmotion, finding that the proposed conversion does not require supermajority approval of the Company’s stockholders, and that the defendants did not breach\ntheir fiduciary duties by disclosing that the proposed conversion required a vote of a simple majority of the Company’s stockholders. The decision is eligible\nfor appeal.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the motions to dismiss or defense of the various actions\nwill be successful.\nEmployment Contracts\nThe Company has entered into agreements with severance terms with certain employees and officers, all of whom are employed on an at-will basis,\nsubject to certain severance obligations in the event of certain involuntary terminations. The Company may be required to accelerate the vesting of certain\nstock options and restricted stock in the event of changes in control, as defined, and involuntary terminations.\n14\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements generally relate to future\nevents or our future financial or operating performance and may include statements concerning, among other things, our business strategy (including\nanticipated trends and developments in, and management plans for, our business and the markets in which we operate), financial results, the impact of\nmacroeconomic uncertainty on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our clients, and partners operate, results of\noperations, revenues, operating expenses, capital expenditures including share repurchases, sales and marketing initiatives and competition. In some cases,\nyou can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,”\n“could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “suggests,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of\nthese words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance; they reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected\nor implied by forward-looking statements.\nWe discuss many of these risks in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors” and in other\nfilings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates\nand assumptions only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are inherently subject to change and involve risks and uncertainties. Unless\nrequired by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could\ndiffer materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made. Given these uncertainties, investors should\nnot place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\nInvestors should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed with the SEC, including\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be\nmaterially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nReferences to “Notes” are notes included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe offer a self-service, cloud-based ad-buying platform that empowers our clients to plan, manage, optimize and measure more expressive data-driven\ndigital advertising campaigns. Our platform allows clients to execute integrated campaigns across ad formats and channels, including video (which includes\nconnected television (“CTV”)), display, audio, digital-out-of-home, native and social, on a multitude of devices, such as computers, mobile devices, televisions\nand streaming devices. Our platform’s integrations with major inventory, publisher and data partners provide ad buyers reach and decisioning capabilities, and\nour enterprise application programming interfaces (“APIs”) enable our clients to customize and expand platform functionality.\nOur clients are advertising agencies, advertisers and other service providers for agencies or advertisers, with whom we enter into ongoing master\nservice agreements (“MSAs”). We generate revenue by charging our clients a platform fee based on a percentage of our clients’ total advertising spend on our\nplatform and from providing data, other value-added services and platform features.\n15\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nHighlights\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars Change Dollars Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue $ 628,016 $ 493,266 $ 134,750 27 % $ 1,703,819 $ 1,340,323 $ 363,496 27 %\nNet income $ 94,158 $ 39,352 $ 54,806 139 % $ 210,847 $ 81,617 $ 129,230 158 %\nTrends, Opportunities and Challenges\nThe growing digitization of media and fragmentation of audiences has increased the complexity of advertising and thereby increased the need for\nautomation in ad buying, which we provide on our platform. In order to grow, we will need to continue to develop our platform’s programmatic capabilities and\nexpand our advertising inventory and data offerings. We believe that key opportunities include our ongoing global expansion, continuing development of our\nomnichannel ad inventory (including in channels such as video, including CTV, mobile, audio and others), adoption and utilization of retail media and\ncontinuing development and adoption of the data usage, measurement and targeting capabilities provided by our platform.\nWe believe that growth of the programmatic advertising market is important for our ability to grow our business. Adoption of programmatic\nadvertising by advertisers allows us to acquire new clients and grow revenue from existing clients. Although our clients include some of the largest advertising\nagencies in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to further expand our relationships with existing clients and gain a larger amount of their\nadvertising spend. We also believe that the industry trends noted above will lead to advertisers adopting programmatic advertising through platforms such as\nours.\nSimilarly, the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers allows us to expand the volume and type of\nadvertising inventory we present to our clients. For example, we have expanded our CTV, mobile, native and audio advertising offerings through our\nintegrations with supply-side partners.\nWe invest for long-term growth. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we invest in platform\noperations and technology and development to enhance our product features, including programmatic buying of CTV ad inventory, and in sales and marketing\nto acquire new clients and reinforce our relationships with existing clients. In addition, we expect to continue making investments in our infrastructure,\nincluding our information technology, financial and administrative systems and controls, to support our growing operations.\nWe believe the markets outside of the United States (“U.S.”), and in particular across Europe and Asia in markets such as the United Kingdom\n(“U.K.”), Germany, France, China, Japan, India and Australia, offer opportunities for growth. However, such markets may also pose challenges related to\ncompliance with local laws and regulations, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, uncertainty related to trade relations and a variety of additional\nrisks. We intend to make additional investments in sales and marketing and product development to expand in international markets where we are making\nsignificant investments in our platform and growing our team.\nWe believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may negatively impact profitability in the near term.\nOur business model has allowed us to grow significantly, and we believe that our operating leverage enables us to support future long-term growth\nprofitably.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation and geopolitical developments have resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown\nof economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services in various industries, including those provided by our clients, while\nalso disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time until economic activity normalizes. As a\nresult of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations.\nThe extent of the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, and the duration and\nextent of geopolitical and global economic disruption and their respective impacts on our clients, partners, industry and employees, all of which are uncertain at\nthis time and cannot be accurately predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part II. Other Information for further discussion of the adverse impacts of\nmacroeconomic uncertainty on our business.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2023\nThe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands) (% of Revenue) (in thousands) (% of Revenue)\nRevenue $ 628,016 100 % $ 493,266 100 %\nOperating expenses:\nPlatform operations 122,656 20 % 93,382 19 %\nSales and marketing 140,296 22 % 112,466 23 %\nTechnology and development 117,705 19 % 117,772 24 %\nGeneral and administrative 138,878 22 % 131,969 27 %\nTotal operating expenses 519,535 83 % 455,589 92 %\nIncome from operations 108,481 17 % 37,677 8 %\nTotal other income, net (18,697) (3)% (19,323) (4)%\nIncome before income taxes 127,178 20 % 57,000 12 %\nProvision for income taxes 33,020 5 % 17,648 4 %\nNet income $ 94,158 15 % $ 39,352 8 %\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands) (% of Revenue) (in thousands) (% of Revenue)\nRevenue $ 1,703,819 100 % $ 1,340,323 100 %\nOperating expenses:\nPlatform operations 336,745 20 % 264,903 20 %\nSales and marketing 395,888 23 % 321,177 24 %\nTechnology and development 335,426 20 % 309,790 23 %\nGeneral and administrative 403,902 24 % 388,411 29 %\nTotal operating expenses 1,471,961 86 % 1,284,281 96 %\nIncome from operations 231,858 14 % 56,042 4 %\nTotal other income, net (53,845) (3)% (51,277) (4)%\nIncome before income taxes 285,703 17 % 107,319 8 %\nProvision for income taxes 74,856 4 % 25,702 2 %\nNet income $ 210,847 12 % $ 81,617 6 %\n_______________\nNote: Percentages may not sum due to rounding.\n17\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $135 million, or 27%, and $363 million, or 27%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher gross spend in the current year on our platform, which\nwas primarily driven by new clients, more campaigns executed by existing clients and higher spend per campaign.\nPlatform Operations\nPlatform operations expense increased by $29 million, or 31%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $22 million in hosting costs and $6 million in personnel costs, which included a $2\nmillion increase in stock-based compensation. The increase in hosting costs was primarily attributable to support costs related to the increased use of our\nplatform by our clients, increased use of features by our technical teams in support of our platform and investment in new data centers to support the continued\ngrowth of our platform. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation driven by new equity awards, an\nincrease in platform support by engineers and headcount growth.\nPlatform operations expense increased by $72 million, or 27%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $53 million in hosting costs and $16 million in personnel costs, which included a $6\nmillion increase in stock-based compensation. The increase in hosting costs was primarily attributable to support costs related to the increased use of our\nplatform by our clients, increased use of features by our technical teams in support of our platform and investment in new data centers to support the continued\ngrowth of our platform. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to the increase in stock-based compensation driven by new equity awards, an\nincrease in platform support by engineers, headcount growth, an increase in taxes on equity awards and an increase in travel and employee engagement costs,\nincluding in-person events.\nWe expect platform operations expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to experience increased volumes of media\nimpressions through our platform and hire additional personnel to support our growth.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased by $28 million, or 25%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $21 million in personnel costs, which included a $4 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation, $3 million in marketing costs and $3 million in allocated facilities costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth\nto support our sales efforts and to continue to develop and maintain relationships with our clients; an increase in incentive compensation driven by gross spend\ngrowth; and an increase in travel costs. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by new equity awards. The increase in marketing costs\nwas primarily due to an increase in marketing campaigns, events, creatives and client engagement. The increase in allocated facilities costs was primarily\ndriven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as office support expenses.\nSales and marketing expense increased by $75 million, or 23%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in personnel costs, which included a $17 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation, $8 million in marketing costs and $7 million in allocated facilities costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth\nto support our sales efforts and to continue to develop and maintain relationships with our clients; an increase in incentive compensation driven by gross spend\ngrowth; and an increase in travel and employee engagement costs, including in-person events. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven\nby new equity awards. The increase in marketing costs was primarily due to an increase in marketing campaigns, events, creatives, sponsorships and client\nengagement. The increase in allocated facilities costs was primarily driven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as\noffice support expenses.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, as we focus on increasing the adoption of our platform with\nexisting and new clients and expanding our international business.\nTechnology and Development\nTechnology and development expense decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $7\n18\nTable of Contents\nmillion decrease in stock-based compensation, offset by increases of $4 million in personnel costs and $2 million in allocated facilities costs. The decrease in\nstock-based compensation was primarily driven by the cancellation of unvested equity awards for our former Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”), which\nresulted in the recognition of $14 million in incremental stock-based compensation in the three months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by a $7 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily driven by new equity awards.\nThe increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to headcount growth to maintain and support further development of our platform. The increase in\nallocated facilities costs was primarily driven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as office support expenses.\nTechnology and development expense increased by $26 million, or 8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases of $20 million in personnel costs, which included a $6 million increase in\nstock-based compensation, and $4 million in allocated facilities costs. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to headcount growth to\nmaintain and support further development of our platform, an increase in taxes on equity awards and an increase in travel and employee engagement costs,\nincluding in-person events. The increase in stock-based compensation was due to a $20 million increase primarily driven by new equity awards. This was\npartially offset by the cancellation of unvested equity awards for our former CTO, which resulted in the recognition of $14 million in incremental stock-based\ncompensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, that did not recur in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in allocated\nfacilities costs was primarily driven by new leases for additional office space to support our future growth as well as office support expenses.\nWe expect technology and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the development of our platform to support\nadditional features and functions, increase the number of advertising inventory and data suppliers and support the anticipated increase in volume of advertising\nspending by our clients on our platform. We also intend to invest in technology to further automate our business processes.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $7 million, or 5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of $9 million in personnel costs and $8 million in administrative costs, partially offset by a $10 million\ndecrease in stock-based compensation. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to increased headcount to support our growth, an increase in\ntravel costs and an increase in taxes on equity awards. The increase in administrative costs was primarily driven by increases in external professional fees and\nlocal business taxes. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily due to an $18 million decrease related to the CEO Performance Option driven by\nthe graded-vesting attribution method, under which more expense is recognized earlier in the option’s life, partially offset by an $8 million increase primarily\ndriven by new equity awards.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $15 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases of $26 million in personnel costs and $22 million in administrative costs, partially offset by a $33 million\ndecrease in stock-based compensation. The increase in personnel costs was primarily attributable to increased headcount to support our growth, an increase in\ntravel and employee engagement costs, including in-person events, and an increase in taxes on equity awards. The increase in administrative costs was\nprimarily driven by increases in external professional fees and local business taxes. The decrease in stock-based compensation was primarily due to a $54\nmillion decrease related to the CEO Performance Option driven by the graded-vesting attribution method, under which more expense is recognized earlier in\nthe option’s life, partially offset by a $21 million increase primarily driven by new equity awards.\nExcluding the impact of the CEO Performance Option, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase primarily due to continued\ninvestment in corporate infrastructure to support growth.\nTotal Other Income, Net\nTotal other income, net, decreased by $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to losses on foreign currency forwards, driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. Dollar, offset by foreign currency transaction gains and higher interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments driven by\nrising portfolio interest rates and higher amounts invested.\n19\nTable of Contents\nTotal other income, net, increased by $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, driven by rising portfolio interest\nrates, and foreign currency transaction gains, driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by losses on foreign\ncurrency forwards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax profitability, partially offset by a lower impact attributable to nondeductible stock-based\ncompensation and higher tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax profitability coupled with a decrease in benefits associated with employee stock-based\nawards, partially offset by a lower impact attributable to nondeductible stock-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2,223 million, which included $1,221 million in cash and cash equivalents, $70 million of\nwhich was held by our international subsidiaries, and $510 million in short-term investments in marketable securities. Additionally, we had $442 million\navailable under our Amended Credit Facility (refer to the “Credit Facility” section below). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated $540\nmillion in cash flows from operating activities.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and our undrawn available balance under our Amended Credit Facility\nwill be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase program. Further, we have a shelf registration statement on Form S-3\non file with the SEC (the “Shelf Registration”), which permits us to issue equity securities and equity-linked securities from time to time, subject to certain\nlimitations. The Shelf Registration is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes, subject to\nmarket conditions and our capital needs. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set\nforth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt-financing arrangements.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional\nfinancing by incurring additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive\ncovenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our\nbusiness objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next 12 months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our\nbusiness could be adversely affected. We are closely monitoring the effect that current macroeconomic factors may have on our working capital requirements.\nCredit Facility\nOn June 15, 2021, we and a syndicate of banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the\n“Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility consists of a $450 million revolving loan facility, with a $20 million sublimit for swingline borrowings and a $15 million\nsublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Under certain circumstances, we have the right to increase the Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $300\nmillion.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOn December 17, 2021, we amended the Credit Facility to expand the process for issuing letters of credit and the related invoicing, particularly with\nrespect to letters of credit not denominated in U.S. Dollars. On February 9, 2023, we further amended the Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit\nFacility”) to transition from a variable interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate to a variable interest rate based on the secured overnight\nfinancing rate (“SOFR”).\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have an outstanding debt balance under the Amended Credit Facility. Availability under the Amended Credit\nFacility was $442 million as of September 30, 2024, which is net of outstanding letters of credit of $8 million. The Amended Credit Facility matures, and all\noutstanding amounts become due and payable, on June 15, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants.\nFor additional information regarding the Amended Credit Facility, refer to Note 6—Debt.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $700 million of our Class A\ncommon stock. As of December 31, 2023, $53 million remained available and authorized for repurchases. In February 2024, an additional $647 million was\nauthorized under this program, bringing the total amount available for future repurchases back to $700 million. The share repurchase program, which has no\nexpiration date, is designed to help offset the impact of future share dilution from employee stock issuances. Repurchases under the program may be made in\nthe open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases determined at our discretion, depending on\nmarket conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases are structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within\nthe pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate\nrepurchases of shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and may be\nmodified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of our board of directors.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 0.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for an\naggregate repurchase amount of $54 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2 million shares of\nour Class A common stock for an aggregate repurchase amount of $179 million. The repurchase amounts included in the condensed consolidated statements of\nstockholders’ equity included immaterial amounts related to the 1% excise tax on share repurchases, net of share issuances, as a result of the Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). As of September 30, 2024, $521 million remained available and authorized for repurchases.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 540,055 $ 507,202\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (96,330) $ (50,542)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (117,379) $ (415,402)\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth in our operations, increases or decreases in collections from our clients\nand related payments to our suppliers for advertising inventory and data. We typically pay suppliers in advance of collections from our clients. Our collection\nand payment cycles can vary from period to period. In addition, we expect seasonality to impact cash flows from operating activities on a sequential quarterly\nbasis during the year.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities of $540 million resulted primarily from net income adjusted for\nnoncash items of $670 million and a net decrease from our operating assets and liabilities of $130 million. The net decrease from our operating assets and\nliabilities was due to a $126 million increase in accounts receivable, a $68 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $32 million decrease in\noperating lease liabilities, partially offset by an $87 million increase in accounts payable and a $9 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The\nincrease in accounts receivable was due to the growth of our business and the timing of cash receipts from clients. The increase in prepaid expenses and other\nassets was primarily due to cash paid for income taxes. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due primarily to rent payments. The increase in accounts\npayable was due to the growth of our business and the timing of supplier payments for the cost of advertising inventory, data and add-on features. The increase\nin accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in the liability related to the ESPP for employee contributions toward the upcoming\npurchase of shares.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities of $507 million resulted primarily from net income adjusted for\nnoncash items of $542 million, and a net decrease from our operating assets and liabilities of $35 million. The net decrease from our operating assets and\nliabilities was primarily due to a $131 million increase in accounts receivable and a $37 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $126\nmillion increase in accounts payable and an $18 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due to\nseasonality and the timing of cash receipts from clients. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due primarily to rent payments. The increase in accounts\npayable was due to seasonality and the timing of supplier payments for the cost of advertising inventory, data and add-on features. The increase in accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities was due to the timing of payment of personnel costs.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities consist of investing in short-term marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment for the expansion of our\nnew facilities in support of our hosting capabilities and expanding headcount as a result of our growth and capital expenditures to develop our software. As our\nbusiness grows, we expect our capital expenditures to increase, and our other investment activity may increase.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $96 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of $78 million to purchase property and\nequipment, $12 million of net purchases of short-term investments and $7 million of investments in capitalized software.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $51 million of cash in investing activities, consisting of $23 million of net purchases of\nshort-term investments, $22 million to purchase property and equipment and $6 million of investments in capitalized software.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $117 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $177 million of cash paid for\nrepurchases of our Class A common stock and $98 million of taxes paid for restricted stock award settlements, partially offset by $128 million of proceeds from\nstock option exercises and $30 million of proceeds from our ESPP.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $415 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $427 million of cash paid for\nrepurchases of Class A common stock and $55 million of taxes paid for restricted stock award settlements, partially offset by $45 million of proceeds from\nstock option exercises and $21 million of proceeds from our ESPP.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose\nentities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We did not\nhave any other off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024 other than the indemnification agreements described below.\n22\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of non-cancelable operating leases for our various office facilities and other contractual commitments consisting of\nobligations to our hosting services, hardware providers and providers of software as a service. In certain cases, the terms of the lease agreements provide for\nrental payments on a graduated basis.\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nRemainder of 2024 2025 and Thereafter Total\nOperating lease commitments $ 14,721 $ 643,416 $ 658,137\nOther contractual commitments 77,839 275,682 353,521\nTotal $ 92,560 $ 919,098 $ 1,011,658\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements in which we may agree to indemnify clients, suppliers, vendors, lessors, business\npartners, lenders, stockholders and other parties with respect to certain matters, including losses resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement,\ndamages to property or persons, business losses or other liabilities. Generally, these indemnity and defense obligations relate to our own business operations,\nobligations and acts or omissions. However, under some circumstances, we agree to indemnify and defend contract counterparties against losses resulting from\ntheir own business operations, obligations and acts or omissions, or the business operations, obligations and acts or omissions of third parties. These indemnity\nprovisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements in which they appear. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements\nwith our directors, executive officers and other officers that will require us to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or\nservice as directors, officers or employees. In the ordinary course of business, demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such\nagreements, but we are not aware of any claims that could have a material effect on our balance sheet, statement of operations or statement of cash flows.\nAccordingly, no amounts for any obligation have been recorded at September 30, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, including the determination of revenue\nrecognition as net versus gross in our revenue arrangements, stock-based compensation expense and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These\nrisks include primarily interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates under our Amended Credit Facility, which accrues interest at a variable rate. No amount\nwas owed on our Amended Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. We have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk\nexposure. Based upon the short-term investments\n23\nTable of Contents\namount as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in the interest rate would result in a corresponding increase or\ndecrease in investment income of approximately $5 million annually.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Euro, British\nPound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Indonesian Rupiah, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar. The volatility of\nexchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. As of September 30, 2024, an immediate 10% adverse change in\nforeign exchange rates on foreign-denominated accounts would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $34 million. In the event our non-U.S. Dollar\ndenominated sales and expenses increase, our operating results may be more greatly affected by exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe enter into forward contracts or other derivative transactions in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk. There can be no assurance that such\ntransactions will be effective in hedging some or all of our foreign currency exposures, and under some circumstances they could generate losses for us.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls\nand procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our\nCEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nManagement recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that\nthe objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in\ndecision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is\nbased in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated\ngoals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and\nnot be detected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, litigation and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Although the outcome of the various legal proceedings, litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that\nany of these proceedings or other claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Regardless\nof the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nOn May 27, 2022, a stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit captioned Huizenga v. Green, et al., No. 2022-0461, asserting claims on our behalf against\ncertain members of our board of directors in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On June 27, 2022, a second derivative lawsuit captioned Pfeiffer v.\nGreen, et al., No. 2022-0560, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging substantially similar claims. Those lawsuits were\nconsolidated on August 18, 2022, and a lead plaintiff was appointed on October 7, 2022. The two complaints allege generally that the defendants breached their\nfiduciary duties to us and our stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the CEO Performance Option. The plaintiffs seek a court order\nrescinding the CEO Performance Option and monetary damages. On November 10, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint, and on January 12,\n2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On March 24, 2023, plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants’ motions to dismiss.\nDefendants filed their replies in support of their motions to dismiss on May 19, 2023. The court heard oral argument on the motions on April 3, 2024.\nOn October 4, 2024, a stockholder filed a class action complaint in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware alleging claims for breach of\ncontract against us and breach of fiduciary duties against our directors, in connection with the Company’s proposed reincorporation from Delaware to Nevada.\nGunderson v. The Trade Desk, Inc., No. 2024-1029 (Del. Ch.). On October 24, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The complaint seeks, among\nother things, an order declaring that our proposed conversion requires approval by a supermajority of our stockholders and an order enjoining the November\n14, 2024 stockholder vote on the proposed conversion. On October 28, 2024, the parties completed expedited briefing on cross motions for summary judgment\nregarding the causes of action asserted in the original complaint, and the Court heard oral argument on the motions on October 30, 2024. On November 6,\n2024, the Court granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion and denied the plaintiff’s cross-motion, finding that the proposed conversion does not\nrequire supermajority approval of our stockholders, and that the defendants did not breach their fiduciary duties by disclosing that the proposed conversion\nrequired a vote of a simple majority of our stockholders. The decision is eligible for appeal.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the motions to dismiss or defense of the various actions\nwill be successful.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below,\ntogether with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the condensed consolidated financial statements and the\nrelated notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, before making investment decisions related to our\nClass A common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we fail to maintain and grow our client base and spend through our platform, our revenue and business may be negatively impacted.\nTo sustain or increase our revenue, we must regularly add new clients and encourage existing clients to maintain or increase the amount of spending\nthrough our platform and adopt existing or new features and functionalities that we make available. If competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated\nofferings that compete with or are perceived to compete with our offerings, our ability to sell our services to new or existing clients could be impaired. We have\nspent significant effort in cultivating our relationships with advertising agencies, which has resulted in an increase in the budgets allocated to, and the amount\nof advertising purchased on, our platform. However, it is possible that we may reach a point of saturation at which we cannot continue to grow our revenue\nfrom such agencies because of internal limits that advertisers may place on the allocation of their advertising budgets to digital media to a particular provider or\notherwise. While we\n25\nTable of Contents\ngenerally have master services agreements (“MSAs”) in place with our clients, such agreements allow our clients to choose the amount they spend through our\nplatform and terminate our services with limited notice. We at times supplement our MSAs with joint business plans and other incentive programs designed to\nincrease spending from existing clients; however, such increased spending may not materialize in the amounts we expect or at all. We do not typically have\nexclusive relationships with our clients and there is limited cost and difficulty to moving their media spend to our competitors. As a result, we have limited\nvisibility to our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure you that our clients will continue to use our platform or related offerings to the extent that\nwe expect or at all, or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing clients with new clients that generate comparable revenue. If a\nmajor client representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our platform or related offerings or to cease their use\naltogether, it is possible that our revenue or revenue growth rate could be significantly reduced, and our business negatively impacted.\nThe loss of advertising agencies as clients could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur client base consists primarily of advertising agencies. We do not have exclusive relationships with advertising agencies, and we depend on\nagencies to work with us to build and maintain advertiser relationships and execute advertising campaigns.\nThe loss of agencies as clients could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to maintain satisfactory\nrelationships with an advertising agency, we risk losing business from the current and future advertisers represented by that agency.\nAdvertisers may change advertising agencies. If an advertiser switches from an agency that utilizes our platform to one that does not, we will lose\nrevenue from that advertiser. In addition, some advertising agencies have their own relationships with suppliers of advertising inventory and data and can\ndirectly connect advertisers with such suppliers. Our business may suffer to the extent that advertising agencies and such suppliers purchase and sell\nadvertising inventory or data directly from one another or through intermediaries other than us.\nWe had over 1,100 clients, consisting primarily of advertising agencies, as of December 31, 2023. Many of these agencies are owned by holding\ncompanies, where decision making is decentralized such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local\nbranch or division level. If all of our individual client contractual relationships were aggregated at the holding company level, Publicis Groupe would have\nrepresented more than 10% of our gross billings for 2023.\nIn most cases, we enter into separate contracts and billing relationships with the individual agencies and account for them as separate clients.\nHowever, some holding companies for these agencies may choose to exert control over the individual agencies in the future. If so, any loss of relationships\nwith such holding companies and consequently, of their agencies, local branches or divisions, as clients could significantly harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to innovate or make the right investment decisions in our offerings and platform, we may fail to attract and retain advertisers and advertising\nagencies and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in technology and laws governing our activities, evolving client needs and expectations and the\nfrequent introduction by our competitors of new and enhanced offerings. If new or existing competitors have more attractive offerings, we may lose clients or\nclients may decrease their use of our platform. New client demands, superior competitive offerings or new industry standards could require us to make\nunanticipated and costly changes to our platform or business model. We must constantly make investment decisions regarding offerings and technology to meet\nclient demand and evolving industry and legal standards. We may make bad decisions regarding these investments. Furthermore, even if we believe that our\ninvestments improve upon our platform and offerings, such as updates to our various platform features and user interface, they may nevertheless fail to meet\nnew or existing client expectations or preferences, which could result in decreased client adoption or use of our platform.\nIn addition, as we develop and introduce new products and services, including those incorporating or utilizing artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning and new processing of personal information, including identifiable information, they may raise new, or heighten existing, technological, security, legal\nand other risks and challenges, which may cause unintended consequences, and they may not function properly or may be misused by our clients. If we fail to\nadapt to our\n26\nTable of Contents\nrapidly changing industry or to evolving client needs or expectations, or we provide new or updated products and services that exacerbate technological,\nsecurity, legal or other challenges, the reputation of and demand for our platform or related offerings could decrease and our business, financial condition and\noperations may be adversely affected.\nThe market for programmatic buying for advertising campaigns is relatively new and evolving. If this market develops slower or differently than we expect,\nour business, growth prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue has been derived from clients that programmatically purchase advertising through our platform. We expect\nthat spending on programmatic ad buying will continue to be our primary source of revenue for the foreseeable future and that our revenue growth will largely\ndepend on increasing spend through our platform. The market for programmatic ad buying is a relatively new market, and our current and potential clients may\nnot shift to programmatic ad buying from other buying methods as quickly as we expect, which would reduce our growth potential. If the market for\nprogrammatic ad buying deteriorates or develops more slowly than we expect, it could reduce demand for our platform, and our business, growth prospects and\nfinancial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our revenue may not necessarily grow at the same rate as spend on our platform. As the market for programmatic buying for advertising\nmatures, growth in spend may outpace growth in our revenue due to a number of factors, including pricing competition, quantity discounts and shifts in\nproduct, media, client and channel mix. A significant change in revenue as a percentage of spend could reflect an adverse change in our business and growth\nprospects. In addition, any such fluctuations, even if they reflect our strategic decisions, could cause our performance to fall below the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry. We expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our\nability to increase revenue and maintain profitability. New technologies and methods of buying advertising present a dynamic competitive challenge, as market\nparticipants develop and offer new products and services aimed at capturing advertising spend or disrupting the digital marketing landscape, such as analytics,\nautomated media buying and exchanges.\nWe may also face competition from new companies entering the market, including large established companies and companies that we do not yet\nknow about or do not yet exist. If existing or new companies develop, market or resell competitive high-value products or services that result in additional\ncompetition for advertising spend or advertising inventory or if they acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our\ncompetitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our results of operations could be harmed.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have, which may allow\nthem to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. They may also have more extensive advertiser\nbases and broader publisher relationships than we have, rich first-party data sets, and may be better positioned to execute on advertising conducted over certain\nchannels, such as social media, mobile, and video. Some of our competitors may have a longer operating history and greater name recognition. As a result,\nthese competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies, develop superior solutions, develop deeper advertiser relationships or offer\nservices at lower prices. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our platform or related offerings and could result in increased\npricing pressure, increased development, sales and marketing expense, or the loss of market share.\nAny decrease in the use of the advertising channels that we are primarily dependent upon, failure to expand the use of emerging channels, or unexpected\nshift in use among the channels in which we operate, could harm our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, our clients have predominantly used our platform to purchase mobile, display and video advertising inventory. In particular, the CTV\nmarket is quickly evolving and the demand for CTV inventory on our platform has been a significant driver of growth. We expect that these will continue to be\nsignificant channels used by our clients for digital advertising in the future. We also believe that our revenue growth may depend on our ability to expand\nwithin social, native, audio, and especially CTV, and we have been, and are continuing to, enhance such channels. Any decrease in the use of mobile, display\nand video advertising, whether due to clients losing confidence in the value or effectiveness of such channels, regulatory restrictions, consumer choices, or\nother causes, or any inability to further penetrate social, native,\n27\nTable of Contents\naudio or CTV, or enter new and emerging advertising channels, could harm our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEach advertising channel presents distinct and substantial risk and, in many cases, requires us to continue to develop additional functionality or features\nto address the particular requirements of the channel. Our ability to provide capabilities across multiple advertising channels, which we refer to as\nomnichannel, may be constrained if we are not able to maintain or grow advertising inventory for such channels, and some of our omnichannel offerings may\nnot gain market acceptance. If we fail to maintain a diversified channel mix, a decrease in the demand for any channel or channels that we become primarily\ndependent upon could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to accurately predict changes in overall advertiser\ndemand for the channels in which we operate and cannot assure you that our investment in channel development will correspond to any such changes.\nFurthermore, if our channel mix changes due to a shift in client demand, such as clients shifting their spending more quickly or more extensively than expected\nto channels in which we have relatively less functionality, features, or inventory, then demand for our platform could decrease, and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our access to quality advertising inventory is diminished or fails to expand, our revenue could decline and our growth could be impeded.\nWe must maintain a consistent supply of quality ad inventory that is attractive to our clients. Our success depends on our ability to secure quality\ninventory on reasonable terms across a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges and social media platforms, including video, display, CTV, audio\nand mobile inventory. The amount, quality and cost of inventory available to us can change at any time, including as publishers and other inventory suppliers\nrespond to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape. A few inventory suppliers hold a significant portion of the programmatic inventory either generally or\nconcentrated in a particular channel, such as audio and social media. In addition, we compete with companies with which we have business relationships. For\nexample, Google is one of our largest advertising inventory suppliers in addition to being one of our competitors. If Google or any other company with\nattractive advertising inventory limits our access to its advertising inventory, our business could be adversely affected. If our relationships with certain of our\nsuppliers were to cease, or if the material terms of these relationships were to change unfavorably, our business would be negatively impacted. Our suppliers\nare generally not bound by long-term contracts. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will have access to a consistent supply of quality inventory on\nfavorable terms or at all. If we are unable to compete favorably for advertising inventory available on real-time advertising exchanges, or if real-time\nadvertising exchanges decide not to make their advertising inventory available to us, we may not be able to place advertisements or find alternative sources of\ninventory with comparable traffic patterns and consumer demographics in a timely manner. Furthermore, the inventory that we access through real-time\nadvertising exchanges may be of low quality or misrepresented to us, despite attempts by us and our suppliers to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance\nchecks.\nInventory suppliers control the bidding process, rules and procedures for the inventory they supply. Such processes may not always work in our favor\nor for the benefit of our clients and may create inefficiencies in the supply chain for advertising inventory. Given the importance of ensuring access to quality\ninventory for our advertisers, we launched our OpenPath offering, in order to give clients a simplified, direct connection to publishers. Although we have been\ninvesting in this offering and have grown the amount of OpenPath inventory and publishers available through our platform, we cannot guarantee that this\noffering will prove attractive to our clients or that we will otherwise be successful in our efforts.\nAs new types of inventory become available, we will need to expend significant resources to ensure we have access to such new inventory. For\nexample, although television advertising is a large market, only a very small percentage of it is currently purchased through digital advertising exchanges. We\nare investing heavily in our programmatic television offering, including by increasing our workforce and by adding new features, functions and integrations to\nour platform. If the CTV market does not continue to grow as we anticipate or we fail to successfully serve such market, our growth prospects could be\nharmed.\nOur success depends on consistently adding valued inventory in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to maintain a consistent supply of quality\ninventory for any reason, client retention and loyalty, and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCurrent or future global market uncertainties or downturns and associated macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could harm the overall demand\nfor advertising and the economic health of advertisers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of advertisers that benefit from our platform. Current or\nfuture global market uncertainties or downturns and associated macroeconomic conditions, such as growing inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary fears,\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, the impact of global instability in many parts of the world and public health crises, may\ndisrupt the operations of our clients and partners and cause advertisers to decrease or pause their advertising budgets, which could reduce spend though our\nplatform and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we explore new countries to expand our business, economic\ndownturns or unstable market conditions in any of those countries could also result in our investments not yielding the returns we anticipate.\nSeasonal fluctuations in advertising activity could have a negative impact on our revenue, cash flow and results of operations.\nOur revenue, cash flow, results of operations and other key operating and performance metrics may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal\nnature of our clients’ spending on advertising campaigns. For example, clients tend to devote more of their advertising budgets to the fourth calendar quarter to\ncoincide with consumer holiday spending. Moreover, advertising inventory in the fourth quarter may be more expensive due to increased demand for it.\nPolitical advertising could also cause our revenue to increase during election cycles and decrease during other periods. Our historical revenue growth has\nlessened the impact of seasonality; however, seasonality could have a more significant impact on our revenue, cash flow and results of operations from period\nto period if our growth rate declines, if seasonal spending becomes more pronounced, or if seasonality otherwise differs from our expectations.\nWe allow our clients to utilize application programming interfaces (“APIs”) with our platform and related offerings, which could result in outages or\nsecurity breaches and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe use of APIs by our clients has significantly increased in recent years. Our APIs allow clients to build their own media buying and data\nmanagement interface by using our APIs to develop custom integration of their business with our platform and related offerings. The increased use of APIs\nincreases security and operational risks to our systems and the users of our systems, including the risk for intrusion attacks, data theft, or denial of service\nattacks. Furthermore, while APIs allow clients greater ease and power in accessing our platform and related offerings, they also increase the risk of overusing\nour systems, potentially causing outages. We have experienced system slowdowns due to client overuse of our systems through our APIs. While we have taken\nmeasures intended to decrease security and outage risks associated with the use of our APIs, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful. Our\nfailure to prevent outages or security breaches resulting from API use could result in government enforcement actions against us, claims for damages by\nconsumers and other affected individuals, and costs associated with investigating and remediating damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which\ncould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience outages, disruptions and malfunctions on our platform and related offerings if we fail to maintain adequate security and supporting\ninfrastructure and processes, which may harm our reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we expand our offerings, which in some instances involves ingesting more identifiable information, the consequences of potential security\nvulnerabilities become more significant for our business. We expect to continue to invest in technology and security services, equipment, and expertise,\nincluding engineers, data centers, network services and database technologies, as well as potentially increase our reliance on open source software. Without\nthese improvements, our operations might suffer from security vulnerabilities or misuse, system disruptions, data loss, slow transaction processing, unreliable\nservice levels, impaired quality or delays in reporting accurate information regarding transactions in our platform, any of which could negatively affect our\nfinancial condition, reputation and ability to attract and retain clients. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may\nrequire us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance our business will increase. If we fail to respond to\ntechnological change or to adequately maintain, protect, expand, upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure in a timely fashion, our growth prospects\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. The steps we take to increase the reliability, integrity and security of our platform and related offerings as\nthey scale are expensive and complex, and our execution could result in operational failures and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks\ncould include denial-of-service attacks impacting service availability (including the ability to deliver ads) and reliability, tricking\n29\nTable of Contents\ncompany employees into releasing control of their systems to a hacker, or the introduction of computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to steal\nconfidential or proprietary data. Cyberattacks of increasing sophistication may be difficult to detect and could result in the theft of our intellectual property and\ndata, including personal information. We are also vulnerable to unintentional errors or malicious or improper actions by persons with authorized access to our\nsystems that exceed the scope of their access rights, distribute data erroneously, or, unintentionally or intentionally, interfere with the intended operations and\nfunctioning of our platform and related offerings. Moreover, we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our\ninventory and data suppliers, such as real-time advertising exchanges. Misuse, vulnerabilities, outages and disruptions of our platform and related offerings,\nincluding due to cyberattacks, may require engagement with regulators or lead to legal actions, and may harm our reputation and negatively impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational performance and internal control issues may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and subject us to\nliability.\nOur platform and related offerings are complex and proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations and software\ndevelopment teams for their continued performance. Operational, performance and internal control issues may arise due to a variety of factors, including\ninfrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors and other internal and external variables. Such issues have caused errors,\nfailures, design flaws, vulnerabilities and bugs in the past and may again in the future. We also rely on third-party technology and systems to perform properly,\nwhich are often used in connection with computing environments utilizing different operating systems, system management software, equipment and\nnetworking configurations, which may cause errors in, or failures of, our platform and related offerings or such other computing environments. Operational,\nperformance and internal control issues with our platform and related offerings, which we may experience and have experienced in the past, could include the\nfailure of our user interface, outages, errors, discrepancies in costs billed versus costs paid, unauthorized bidding, cessation of our ability to bid or deliver\nimpressions, deletion of our reporting information, unanticipated volume overwhelming our databases, server failure or catastrophic events affecting one or\nmore server farms.\nOperational, performance, design, and internal control issues with our platform and related offerings, whether real or perceived, could also result in\nnegative publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, government investigations, loss of clients, loss of data, loss of or delay in market acceptance or market\nshare of our platform or related offerings, increased costs or loss of revenue, loss of the ability to access our platform or related offerings, loss of competitive\nposition, claims by clients for losses sustained by them and loss of stockholder confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nAlleviating problems resulting from such issues could require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or\nthe cessation of our business, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf unauthorized access is obtained to user, client or inventory and third-party provider data, or our platform or related offerings are compromised, our\nservices may be disrupted or perceived as insecure, and as a result, we may lose existing clients or fail to attract new clients, and we may incur significant\nreputational harm and legal and financial liabilities.\nWe face various and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and the data that we\nprocess. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of significant amounts of data from users, clients, and inventory and data providers, a\nlarge volume of which is hosted by third-party service providers. Our services and the data on our platform, related offerings and in our systems could be\nexposed to unauthorized access due to activities that breach or undermine security measures, including: negligence or malfeasance by internal or external\nactors; attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, clients or vendors to disclose information or data, including personal information; or\nerrors or vulnerabilities in our systems, products or processes or in those of our service providers, clients, and vendors.\nFor example, from time to time, we experience cyberattacks of varying degrees and other attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our systems,\nincluding to employee mailboxes. We have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate resources toward security protections that shield data from these\nactivities, including worldwide incident response teams and dedicated resources to incident response processes. However, such measures cannot provide\nabsolute security and could, among other issues, fail to be adequate or accurately assess the incident severity, not proceed quickly enough, or fail to sufficiently\nremediate an incident. Further, we can expect that the deployment of techniques to circumvent our security measures may occur with more frequency and\nsophistication and may not be recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate or detect these techniques or to\nimplement adequate preventative measures.\n30\nTable of Contents\nMany of our employees now have a hybrid work schedule consisting of both in-person work and working from home. Although we have implemented\nwork-from-home protocols and provide work-issued devices to employees, the actions of our employees while working from home may have a greater effect\non the security of our systems, platform, related offerings and the data we process, including by increasing the risk of compromise to our systems, confidential\ninformation or data arising from employees’ combined personal and private use of devices, accessing our systems or data using wireless networks that we do\nnot control or the ability to transmit or store company-controlled data outside of our secured network.\nA breach of our security, a flawed design, and/or our failure to respond sufficiently to a security incident could disrupt our services and result in theft,\nmisuse, loss, corruption, or improper use or disclosure of data. This could result in government investigations, lawsuits (including class actions), enforcement\nactions and other legal and financial liability, and/or loss of confidence in the availability and security of our products and services, all of which could seriously\nharm our reputation and brand and impair our ability to attract and retain clients. As some of our newer offerings involve the receipt and processing of\nidentifiable information, the risks associated with data, including risks to breach of our systems increases, and we could be subject to contractual breach and\nindemnification claims from other clients and partners and otherwise suffer damage to our reputation, brand, and business. Our platform may also receive data\nin aggregated or pseudonymized form, and if our systems are breached and such data or information is compromised, it could be damaging to our brand,\nreputation, and business. Cyberattacks could also compromise our own trade secrets and other confidential information and result in such information being\ndisclosed to others and becoming less valuable, which could negatively affect our business. Although we maintain errors or omissions and cyber liability\ninsurance, the costs related to an incident or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means and insurance and\nother safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all. We also cannot guarantee that applicable insurance will be available to us in the\nfuture on economically reasonable terms or at all.\nPrivacy and data protection laws to which we and our clients, inventory partners, and third-party data providers are subject may cause us to incur\nadditional or unexpected costs, subject us to investigations or enforcement actions for alleged compliance failures, result in less demand for our products\nand services, or cause us to change our platform, related offerings or business model, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInformation relating to individuals and their devices (commonly called “personal information” or “personal data”) is regulated under a wide variety of\nlocal, state, national and international laws and regulations that apply to its collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer (including transfer across\nnational boundaries) and other processing. We typically collect and store IP addresses and other device identifiers (such as unique cookie identifiers and mobile\napplication identifiers), which are or may be considered personal data or personal information in many jurisdictions or otherwise subject to regulation. In\nconnection with certain of our offerings, including Unified ID 2.0, EUID and OpenPass, we receive information that directly identifies individuals, such as\nemail addresses and phone numbers, both directly from consumers and from our clients or others. We deploy technical and security measures, internal policy\ncontrols, and contractual measures to limit how such identifying information is used and shared and to help honor consumer choices. Nevertheless, we cannot\nguarantee any such measures or controls will be effective and handling identifying information increases our exposure under privacy and data protection laws.\nThe global regulatory landscape regarding the privacy and protection of personal information is evolving, and U.S. (state, federal and local) and\nforeign governments continue to consider and enact additional legislation and rulemaking related to privacy and data protection, often with a particular focus\non intermediaries in the online advertising ecosystem, including those that engage in targeted advertising, “sell” or “share” personal data, and act as “data\nbrokers.” We expect to see an increase in, or changes to, privacy and data protection legislation and regulation in this area for the foreseeable future. For\nexample, in the U.S., the FTC continues to propose updates to existing regulations, including those governing collection of data from children online and\nrelated to “commercial surveillance” generally. Further, the FTC uses its enforcement powers under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC\nAct”) (which prohibits “unfair” and “deceptive” trade practices) to investigate companies engaging in online tracking. For example, the FTC has been very\nactive in bringing enforcement actions against companies that handle personal data it views as sensitive for advertising purposes, including location data\nbrokers and companies that process health-related data. These enforcement announcements signal increased regulatory scrutiny of advertising practices that\ninvolve “sensitive” categories of personal data such as health data and precise location information. Other companies in the advertising technology space have\nbeen subject to government investigation by regulatory bodies; advocacy organizations have also filed complaints with data protection authorities against\nadvertising technology companies, arguing that certain of these companies’ practices do not comply with data privacy laws, or consumer protection laws such\nas the FTC Act. We cannot avoid the possibility that one of these investigations or enforcement actions will require us to alter our practices. In addition, a\npotential federal omnibus\n31\nTable of Contents\nprivacy law remains a possibility. Although the initial momentum surrounding it has waned, if ultimately passed, such a law would likely substantially impact\nthe online advertising ecosystem.\nState lawmakers are also actively addressing consumer data privacy issues. Many states have adopted omnibus consumer privacy laws, some of which\nare already enforceable, while others will take effect over the coming years. These state laws define “personal information” broadly enough to include many\nonline identifiers provided by individuals’ devices, applications, and protocols (such as IP addresses, mobile application identifiers and unique cookie\nidentifiers), individuals’ location data, and hashed versions of email addresses and phone numbers. These laws generally require covered businesses to meet\nnumerous data privacy-related obligations and establish data privacy rights for consumers in such states (including rights to opt out of certain processing of\ntheir personal data and to request correction, deletion of and access to personal data), imposing special rules on the collection of personal data from minors and\nother personal data deemed “sensitive” under the laws, and creating new notice obligations. Many also impose data minimization requirements, mandating that\ncompanies only collect and process data for certain purposes. Most significant for the advertising industry, however, these laws require businesses that engage\nin certain advertising uses of personal data to offer and honor an opt-out of such activities, including, in some states, through browser or device-based\npreference signals. (Terminology varies slightly among some of the state laws, tying the opt-out requirement to “targeted advertising,” “sales” or “sharing” of\npersonal data.) Because of these obligations, the availability of data within our platform, our other offerings and the advertising ecosystem more broadly may\ndecline, potentially making our platform and offerings less valuable to our clients.\nThe requirement under certain states’ laws to honor users’ requests to opt out of certain disclosures and uses of data for advertising purposes through\npreference signals, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) or similar signals, reflects a broader attention that privacy advocates, the media and some\ngovernment regulators, such as the FTC, have devoted to digital advertising in recent years. If the use of the GPC or similar technical signals is adopted by\nmany Internet users, is imposed by additional states or by federal or foreign legislation or is agreed upon by standard setting groups, we may have to change\nour business practices, our clients may reduce their use of our platform and offerings, and our business could be harmed.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations will likely also increase compliance costs and obligations on us, our clients, and other companies in the\nadvertising industry. Although we have attempted to mitigate certain risks posed by these laws through contractual, platform and product changes, we cannot\npredict with certainty the effect of these laws and their implementing regulations, many of which are not yet finalized, on our business, nor the share of\nconsumers who will carry out their opt-out and other rights and how these actions will impact us, our clients, inventory sources, and our industry. Further,\nenforcement activity under such laws already in effect, particularly in California, reflects an ongoing focus on online advertising activities and signals\nregulators’ willingness to pursue in-depth investigations and impose substantial penalties on entities allegedly operating in violation of the statute. Thus, we\nexpect that continuing to maintain compliance with states’ varying legal requirements, including monitoring and adjusting to new regulations and\ninterpretations that emerge through enforcement actions, will require significant time, resources, and expense, as will the effort to monitor whether additional\nchanges to our business practices and our backend configuration are needed, all of which may increase operating costs, or limit our ability to operate or expand\nour business.\nIn addition to these broad-based consumer privacy laws, lawmakers and regulators continue to focus on activities that involve use of categories of\npersonal data perceived as especially sensitive, such as health data and children’s data. For example, several states have enacted laws that would substantially\nimpact activities that involve showing targeted advertisements to individuals under 18 through a variety of new restrictions, or in some cases prohibit it\naltogether. In addition, several recent federal bills would likewise further regulate the processing of children’s data and other personal data perceived as\nespecially sensitive. Further, several states have enacted laws, updated existing laws or have introduced bills to impose new privacy obligations related to\nhealth-related personal information beyond that governed by federal and state laws governing medical records and similar information, such as HIPAA. For\nexample, Washington’s My Health, My Data Act (“MHMD”) introduced a host of requirements related to a very broadly-defined notion of consumer health\ndata that impacts the advertising industry in part because MHMD is subject to a private right of action (unlike other state privacy laws), so plaintiffs’ attorneys\ncould explore claims that stretch the bounds of the law’s text. These laws and the heightened scrutiny associated with the enforcement of such laws may, in\nturn, ultimately lead to increased compliance and defense costs, and more obligations on us, our clients and other companies in the advertising industry.\nLaws governing the processing of personal data in Europe (including the U.K., EU and EEA, and the countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway)\nalso continue to impact us and continue to evolve. For example, the GDPR defines “personal data” broadly and enhances data protection obligations for\ncontrollers of such data and for service providers\n32\nTable of Contents\nprocessing the data. It also provides certain rights, such as access and deletion, to the individuals about whom the personal data relates. IAB Europe previously\ncollaborated with the digital advertising industry to create a user-facing framework (the Transparency and Control Framework, or “TCF”) for establishing and\nmanaging legal bases under the GDPR and other U.K. and EU privacy laws including the ePrivacy Directive. Although the TCF is actively in use, its viability\nas a compliance mechanism remains under review by European authorities and we cannot predict its effectiveness over the long term. Non-compliance with the\nGDPR can trigger steep fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue. Relatedly, authorities enforcing the U.K. GDPR have\nthe ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Continuing to maintain compliance with the requirements of the\nGDPR, including monitoring and adjusting to rulings and interpretations that affect our approach to compliance, requires significant time, resources and\nexpense, as will the effort to monitor whether additional changes to our business practices and our backend configuration are needed, all of which may increase\noperating costs, or limit our ability to operate or expand our business.\nData residency and cross-border transfer restrictions also impact our operations. For the transfer of personal data from Europe to the U.S., we rely\nupon, and are certified under, the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks (“DPF”) and the U.K. extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. The DPF replaced\nthe Privacy Shield Framework as an adequate mechanism by which EU companies may pass personal data to the U.S. However, the DPF is already subject to\nlegal challenge in Europe. Relatedly, whether and how other transfer mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses, can be used to transfer personal data to\nthe U.S. is in question. While the adequacy decision for the DPF helps to reduce the legal uncertainty of cross-border transfers of personal data, the long-term\nvalidity of these transfer mechanisms remains uncertain. If all or some jurisdictions within the EU or the U.K. determine that the latest standard contractual\nclauses also cannot be used to transfer personal data to the U.S. and if the DPF is ultimately struck down in a manner similar to the Privacy Shield Framework,\nwe could be left with no reasonable option for the lawful cross-border transfer of personal data. In such circumstances, continuing to transfer personal data\nfrom the EU to the U.S. could lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. Such consequences could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation and business, such as by requiring us to establish systems to maintain certain data in the EU, potentially involving substantial\nexpense and causing us to divert resources from other aspects of our operations, all of which may adversely affect our business. Other jurisdictions have\nadopted or are considering cross-border or data residency restrictions, which could reduce the amount of data we can collect or process and, as a result,\nsignificantly impact our business.\nFurther, our legal risk depends in part on our clients’ or other third parties’ adherence to data privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services\nin ways consistent with end user expectations. We rely on representations made to us by clients, partners and providers that they will comply with all applicable\nlaws, including all relevant data privacy and data protection regulations. Although we make reasonable efforts to enforce such representations and contractual\nrequirements, we do not fully audit our clients’ compliance with our recommended disclosures or their adherence to data privacy laws and regulations. If our\nclients, partners or providers fail to adhere to our expectations or contracts in this regard, we and our clients could be subject to adverse publicity, damages and\nrelated possible investigation or other regulatory activity.\nAdapting our business to enhanced and evolving privacy obligations across relevant jurisdictions could continue to involve substantial expense and\nmay cause us to divert resources from other aspects of our operations, all of which may adversely affect our business. Additionally, as the advertising industry\nevolves, and new ways of collecting, combining and using data are created, governments may enact legislation in response to technological advancements and\nchanges that could result in our having to re-design features or functions of our platform and related offerings, therefore incurring unexpected compliance\ncosts. Further, adaptation of the digital advertising marketplace requires increasingly significant collaboration between participants in the market, such as\npublishers and advertisers. Failure of the industry to adapt to changes required for operating under existing and future data privacy laws, industry approaches\nthat disfavor our platform and offerings, and user response to such changes could negatively impact inventory, data, and demand. We cannot control or predict\nthe pace or effectiveness of such adaptation, and we cannot currently predict the impact such changes may have on our business.\nIn addition to laws regulating the processing of personal data, we, our advertisers, and publishers are also subject to regulation with respect to political\nadvertising activities, which are governed by various federal and state laws in the U.S., and national and provincial laws worldwide. Online political\nadvertising laws are rapidly evolving and, in certain jurisdictions, impose varying substantive transparency and disclosure requirements on advertisers,\npublishers, and/or others in the ecosystem. We saw publishers impose varying prohibitions and restrictions on the types of political advertising and breadth of\ntargeted advertising allowed on their platforms with respect to advertisements for the 2020 U.S. presidential election in response to political advertising\nscandals, such as the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. The lack of\n33\nTable of Contents\nuniformity and increasing restrictions and requirements on transparency and disclosure could adversely impact the inventory made available for political\nadvertising and the demand for such inventory on our platform, and otherwise increase our operating and compliance costs. Concerns about political\nadvertising or other advertising in areas deemed sensitive, whether or not valid and whether or not driven by applicable laws and regulations, industry\nstandards, client or inventory provider expectations, or public perception, may harm our reputation, result in loss of goodwill, and inhibit use of our platform by\ncurrent and future clients.\nWe deploy technical and organizational measures, internal policy controls, and contractual measures to limit how identifying information is used and\nshared and to help honor consumer choices. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee any such measures or controls will be effective and handling identifying\ninformation increases our exposure under privacy and data protection laws. These laws and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is\ninconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our platform and related offerings. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines,\nlawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business. In addition, public perception regarding data protection and privacy are significant in the programmatic advertising buying\nindustry. Concerns about industry practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data, whether or not valid and whether driven by applicable\nlaws and regulations, industry standards, client or inventory provider expectations, or the broader public, may harm our reputation, result in loss of goodwill,\nand inhibit use of our platform or related offerings by current and future clients. For example, perception that our practices involve an invasion of privacy or\nare designed with insufficient protections, whether or not such practices are consistent with current or future laws, regulations, or industry practices, may\nsubject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased\nliability. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and\nfeatures could be limited. All of this could impair our or our clients’ ability to collect, use, or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease\ndemand for our platform and related offerings, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our client base and increase our revenue.\nAdvertising technology industry self-regulation may lead to investigation by government or self-regulatory bodies, government or private litigation, and\noperational costs or harm to reputation or brand.\nIn addition to laws, the online advertising ecosystem is subject to best practices and self-regulatory standards, such as those promulgated by the\nNetwork Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, and similar organizations in Europe and Canada. If we or our clients or partners make\nmistakes in the implementation of these principles, if self-regulatory bodies expand these guidelines, if government authorities issue different guidelines\nregarding targeted advertising, if opt out mechanisms fail to work as designed, or if Internet users misunderstand our technology or our commitments with\nrespect to these principles, we could be subject to negative publicity, government investigation, government or private litigation or investigation by self-\nregulatory bodies or other accountability groups. Any such action against us, or investigations, even if meritless, could be costly and time consuming, require\nus to change our business practices, cause us to divert management’s attention and our resources and be damaging to our brand, reputation and business. In\naddition, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. We cannot yet\ndetermine the impact such future standards may have on our business.\nThird parties control our access to unique identifiers, and if the use of “third-party cookies” or other technology to uniquely identify devices or users is\nrejected by Internet users, restricted or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation, blocked or limited by preference signals, technical changes on end\nusers’ devices and web browsers, or our and our clients’ ability to use data, including on our platform or related offerings is otherwise restricted, our\nperformance may decline, and we may lose advertisers and revenue.\nOur ability to successfully leverage user data and generate revenue from opportunities to serve advertisements could be impacted by restrictions\nimposed by laws or by third parties, including restrictions on our ability to use or read cookies, device identifiers, or other tracking features or our ability to use\nreal-time bidding networks or other bidding networks. For example, if publishers or supply-side platforms decide to limit the data that we receive in order to\ncomply (in their view) with state privacy laws or a potential federal privacy law, then our service may prove to be less valuable to our clients and we may find\nit more difficult to generate revenue. That is, if third parties on which we rely for data or opportunities to serve advertisements impose limitations (for whatever\nreason) or are restricted by other ecosystem participants or applicable regulations, then we may lose the ability to access data, bid on opportunities or purchase\ndigital ad space, which could have a substantial impact on our revenue.\n34\nTable of Contents\nDigital advertising mostly relies on the ability to uniquely identify devices or users across websites and applications, and to collect data about user\ninteractions for purposes such as serving relevant ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads. Devices are identified through unique identifiers stored in cookies\n(and similar technologies), provided by device operating systems for advertising purposes, or are generated based on statistical algorithms applied to\ninformation about a device, such as the IP address and device type. We use device and other identifiers to record information such as when an Internet user\nviews an ad, clicks on an ad, or visits one of our advertiser’s websites or applications. We also use device and other identifiers to help us achieve our\nadvertisers’ campaign goals, including to limit the instances that an Internet user sees the same advertisement, report information to our advertisers regarding\nthe performance of their advertising campaigns, and detect and prevent malicious behavior and invalid traffic throughout our network of inventory. We also use\ndata associated with device and other identifiers to help our clients decide whether to bid on, and how to price, an opportunity to place an advertisement in a\nspecific location, at a given time, in front of a particular Internet user. Additionally, our clients rely on device and other identifiers to add information they have\ncollected or acquired about users into our platform. Without such data, our clients may not have sufficient insight into an Internet user’s activity, which may\ncompromise their and our ability to determine which inventory to purchase for a specific campaign and may undermine the effectiveness of our platform or our\nability to improve our platform and remain competitive.\nToday, digital advertising, including our platform, makes significant use of cookies to store device identifiers for the advertising activities described\nabove. When we use cookies, they are generally considered third-party cookies, which are cookies owned and used by parties other than the owners of the\nwebsite visited by the Internet user. The most commonly used Internet browsers—Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari—allow Internet users to\nmodify their browser settings to prevent some or all cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Internet users can delete cookies from their computers at\nany time. Additionally, some browsers currently, or may in the future, block or limit some third-party cookies by default or may implement user control settings\nthat algorithmically block or limit some cookies. Today, three major web browsers—Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox and Microsoft’s Edge—block third-party\ncookies by default. Google’s web browser, Chrome, has introduced new controls over third-party cookies and had announced plans to deprecate support for\nthird-party cookies and user agent strings entirely beginning in 2025. On July 22, 2024, Google announced that it was updating its plan for deprecation of\ncookies and would, at some point in the future, introduce a new experience in Chrome that allows users to indicate a preference of an undefined type that\nwould apply in an unstated way to the user’s web browsing activity. Google has stated it will continue making its investments and testing various technologies\nunder its label of “Privacy Sandbox” which may provide modified targeting and measurement functionality to digital advertising ecosystem participants as a\nlimited replacement for the functionality currently provided through the use of third-party cookies. We believe that Google’s to-be-defined framework for\nbrowser-based user choice and its ongoing development of these technologies, which we expect to be technically complex and designed in a manner that does\nnot favor us or our partners, has created and will likely continue to create industry uncertainty regarding the potential effects on user experience and advertiser\ntargeting and measurement. Although we believe our platform is well-positioned to adapt to such changes, particularly with our Unified ID 2.0 offering, the\nimpact of such changes remains uncertain and could be more disruptive than we anticipate, including to the display advertising ecosystem in particular, where\nsuch changes could adversely impact our growth in that channel.\nSome Internet users also download free or paid ad-blocking software that not only prevents third-party cookies from being stored on a user’s\ncomputer, but also blocks all interaction with a third-party ad server. In addition, Google has introduced ad-blocking software in its Chrome web browser that\nwill block certain ads based on quality standards established under a multi-stakeholder coalition. If such a feature inadvertently or mistakenly blocks ads that\nare not within the established blocking standards, or if such capabilities become widely adopted and the advertising technology industry does not\ncollaboratively develop alternative technologies, our business could be harmed. The Interactive Advertising Bureau and Digital Advertising Alliance have also\ndeveloped frameworks that allow users to opt out of the “sale” or use of their personal data for targeted advertising purposes under U.S. state privacy laws in\nways that stop or severely limit the ability to show targeted ads. Because many state privacy laws require businesses to permit end users to opt out of\nprocessing their personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, including, in some states through automated signals, we expect that more opt-out solutions\nwill become available that may ultimately be used by end users, which may reduce our clients’ use of our platform and related offerings, and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdvertising shown on mobile applications can also be affected by blocking or restricting use of mobile device identifiers. Data regarding interactions\nbetween users and devices are tracked mostly through stable, pseudonymous advertising identifiers that are built into the device operating system with privacy\ncontrols that allow users to express a preference with respect to data collection for advertising, including to disable the identifier. These identifiers and privacy\n35\nTable of Contents\ncontrols are defined by the developers of the platforms through which the applications are accessed and could be changed by the platforms in a way that may\nnegatively impact our business. For example, Apple has shifted to require user opt-in before permitting access to Apple’s unique identifier, or IDFA, and\nGoogle has announced that it will eventually deprecate the mobile advertising identifier used on Android devices entirely. These changes have had, and will\nlikely continue to have, a substantial impact on the mobile advertising ecosystem and could adversely impact our growth in this channel.\nIn addition, in the EU, Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), commonly referred to as the ePrivacy or Cookie Directive,\ndirects EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie and other similar technologies, is\nallowed only if the Internet user has been informed about such access and given his or her consent. A replacement for the ePrivacy Directive is currently under\ndiscussion by EU member states to complement and bring electronic communication services in line with the GDPR and force a harmonized approach across\nEU member states. Like the GDPR, the proposed ePrivacy Regulation applies extra-territorially to businesses established outside the EU who provide publicly\navailable electronic communications services to, or gather data from the devices of, users in the EU. Though still subject to debate, the proposed ePrivacy\nRegulation may further raise the bar for the use of cookies and the fines and penalties for breach may be significant. We may be required to, or otherwise may\ndetermine that it is advisable to, make significant changes in our business operations and products and services to obtain user opt-in for cookies and use of\ncookie data, or develop or obtain additional tools and technologies to compensate for a lack of cookie data.\nIncreased transparency into the collection and use of data for digital advertising, introduced both through features in browsers and devices and\nregulatory requirements, such as the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws and regulations, “Global Privacy Control” or similar opt-out signals and the ePrivacy\nDirective, as well as compliance with such requirements, may create operational burdens to implement and may lead more users to choose to block the\ncollection and use of data about them. Adapting to these and similar changes has in the past and may in the future require significant time, resources and\nexpense, which may increase our cost of operation or limit our ability to operate or expand our business.\nOur failure to meet standards and provide services that our advertisers and inventory suppliers trust, could harm our brand and reputation and those of\nour partners and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not provide or control the content of the advertisements that we serve or the content of the websites providing the inventory. Advertisers\nprovide the advertising content and inventory suppliers provide the inventory. Both advertisers and inventory suppliers are concerned about being associated\nwith content they consider inappropriate, competitive or inconsistent with their brands or illegal, and they are hesitant to spend money or make inventory\navailable, respectively, without some guarantee of brand security. Consequently, our reputation depends in part on providing services that our advertisers and\ninventory suppliers trust, and we have contractual obligations to meet content and inventory standards. We contractually prohibit the misuse of our platform by\nour clients and inventory suppliers. Additionally, we use our proprietary technology and third-party services to, and we participate in industry co-ops that work\nto, detect malware and other content issues as well as click fraud (whether by humans or software known as “bots”) and to block fraudulent inventory,\nincluding “tool bar” inventory, which is inventory that appears within an application and displaces any advertising that would otherwise be displayed on the\nwebsite. Despite such efforts, our clients may inadvertently purchase inventory that proves to be unacceptable for their campaigns, in which case we may not\nbe able to recoup the amounts paid to inventory suppliers. Preventing and combating fraud is an industry-wide issue that requires constant vigilance, and we\ncannot guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts. Our clients could intentionally run campaigns that do not meet the standards of our inventory\nsuppliers or attempt to use illegal or unethical targeting practices or seek to display advertising in jurisdictions that do not permit such advertising or in which\nthe regulatory environment is uncertain, in which case our supply of ad inventory from such suppliers could be jeopardized. Some of our competitors undertake\nhuman review of content, but because our platform is self-service, and because such means are cost-intensive, we do not utilize all means available to decrease\nthese risks. We may provide access to inventory that is objectionable to our advertisers, serve advertising that contains malware, objectionable content, or is\nbased on questionable targeting criteria to our inventory suppliers, or be unable to detect and prevent non-human traffic, any one of which could harm our or\nour clients’ brand and reputation, decrease their trust in our platform, and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe effects of health epidemics, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by health epidemics, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in the regions in which\nwe and our clients and partners operate, and significantly impacted economic activity and financial markets. Many marketers decreased or paused their\nadvertising spending as a response to the economic uncertainty, decline in business activity and other COVID-19-related impacts, which negatively impacted,\nand with respect to other future health epidemics, may negatively impact, our revenue and results of operations, the extent and duration of which we may not\nbe able to accurately predict.\nThe economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic made, and future health epidemics may make, it difficult for us to forecast revenue and\noperating results and to make decisions regarding operational cost structures and investments. The duration and extent of the impact from future health\nepidemics or other health events depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including measures taken by governments,\nbusinesses and other organizations in response to such epidemic or other public health event, and if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of\nsuch events effectively, our business may be harmed.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience significant growth in a short period of time. To manage our growth effectively, we must continually\nevaluate and evolve our organization. We must also manage our employees, operations, finances, technology and development and capital investments\nefficiently. Our efficiency, productivity and the quality of our platform and client service may be adversely impacted if we do not train our new personnel,\nparticularly our sales and support personnel, quickly and effectively, or if we fail to appropriately coordinate across our organization. Additionally, our rapid\ngrowth may place a strain on our resources, infrastructure and ability to maintain the quality of our platform and related offerings. Our revenue growth and\nlevels of profitability in recent periods should not be considered as indicative of future performance. In future periods, our revenue or profitability could\ndecline or grow more slowly than we expect. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAs our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability.\nWe have expended significant resources to grow our business in recent years by increasing the offerings of our platform, adding new offerings,\ngrowing our number of employees and expanding internationally. Supporting our continued growth may require substantial financial and other resources to,\namong other things:\n• develop our platform and related offerings, including by investing in our engineering team, creating, acquiring or licensing new products or\nfeatures, and improving the availability and security of our platform and related offerings;\n• continue to expand internationally by growing our sales force and client services team in an effort to increase our client base and spend\nthrough our platform, and by adding inventory and data from countries our clients are seeking;\n• improve our technology infrastructure, including investing in internal technology development and acquiring outside technologies;\n• expand our platform’s reach in new and growing channels such as CTV, including expanding the supply of CTV inventory;\n• cover general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses necessary to support a larger organization;\n• cover sales and marketing expenses, including a significant expansion of our direct sales organization;\n• cover expenses relating to data collection and use and consumer privacy compliance, including additional infrastructure, product features,\nsecurity, automation and personnel; and\n• explore strategic acquisitions.\n37\nTable of Contents\nInvesting in the foregoing, however, may not yield anticipated returns. Consequently, as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient\nrevenue to sustain profitability.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees, including Jeff T. Green, and our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate\nhighly skilled employees in the future.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including Jeff T. Green, our founder and Chief\nExecutive Officer. We rely on the leadership, knowledge, and experience that our executive officers provide. They foster our corporate culture, which has been\ninstrumental to our ability to attract and retain new talent. We also rely on our ability to hire and retain qualified and motivated employees, particularly those\nemployees in our product development, support, and sales teams that attract and keep key clients.\nThe market for talent in many of our areas of operations, including California and New York, is intensely competitive, as technology companies like\nours compete to attract the best talent. As a business-to-business company, we do not have the same level of name recognition among potential recruits as\nbusiness-to-consumer companies. Additionally, we have less experience with recruiting and less name recognition in geographies outside of the United States\nand may face additional challenges in attracting and retaining international employees. In addition, many companies now offer a remote or hybrid work\nenvironment, which may increase the competition for employees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. As a result, we may incur\nincreasingly significant costs to attract and retain employees, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits and compensation expenses\nrelated to equity awards, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting\nand training them.\nEmployee turnover, including changes in our management team or failure to manage executive succession effectively, could disrupt our business.\nNone of our key employees have an employment agreement for a specific term, and all of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time.\nThe loss of one or more of our executive officers or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe often have long sales cycles, which can result in significant time between initial contact with a prospect and execution of a client agreement, making it\ndifficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new clients and when we will generate revenue from those clients.\nOur sales cycle for our platform and newer offerings, from initial contact to contract execution and implementation, can take significant time. Our\nsales efforts involve educating our clients about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform and related offerings. Some of our clients undertake\nan evaluation process that frequently involves not only our platform but also the offerings of our competitors. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will\nobtain new clients and begin generating revenue from these new clients. Even if our sales efforts result in obtaining a new client, under our usage-based pricing\nmodel, the client controls when and to what extent it uses our platform. As a result, we may not be able to add clients or generate revenue as quickly as we may\nexpect, which could harm our revenue growth rates.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that may adversely affect our business, working capital, financial condition and results of operations, including\nfrom advertising agencies that do not pay us until they receive payment from their advertisers and from clients that dispute or do not pay their invoices.\nSpend on our platform primarily comes through our agency clients. Many of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the advertiser does\nnot pay the agency, the agency is not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser, a type of arrangement called sequential liability.\nContracting with these agencies, which in some cases have or may develop higher-risk credit profiles, may subject us to greater credit risk than if we were to\ncontract directly with advertisers. This credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency’s aggregated advertiser base. In addition,\ntypically, we are contractually required to pay advertising inventory and data suppliers within a negotiated period of time, regardless of whether our clients pay\nus on time, or at all. In addition, we typically experience slow payment cycles by advertising agencies as is common in our industry. While we attempt to\nnegotiate long payment periods with our suppliers and shorter periods from our clients, we are not always successful. As a result, we often face a timing issue\nwith our accounts payable on shorter cycles than our accounts receivables, requiring us to remit payments from our own funds, and accept the risk of credit\nloss.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThis collections and payments cycle may increasingly consume working capital if we continue to be successful in growing our business. If we are\nunable to borrow on commercially acceptable terms, our working capital availability could be reduced, and as a consequence, our financial condition and\nresults of operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe may also be involved in disputes with clients, and in the case of agencies, their advertisers, over the operation of our platform, the terms of our\nagreements or our billings for purchases made by them through our platform. If we are unable to resolve disputes with our clients, we may lose clients or\nclients may decrease their use of our platform and our financial performance and growth may be adversely affected. If we are unable to collect or make\nadjustments to bills to clients, we could incur write-offs for credit loss, which could harm our results of operations. In the future, credit loss may exceed\nreserves for such contingencies and our credit loss exposure may increase over time. Any increase in write-offs for credit loss could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Even if we are not paid by our clients on time or at all, we are still obligated to pay for the advertising inventory,\nthird-party data and other add-on features that clients purchase on our platform, and as a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations would be adversely impacted.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our results of operations, which could make our future results of operations difficult to predict or cause our results of\noperations to fall below analysts’ and investors’ expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future results of operations to fluctuate due to a variety of\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control. Fluctuations in our results of operations could cause our performance to fall below the expectations of analysts\nand investors, and adversely affect the price of our common stock. Because our business is changing and evolving rapidly, our historical results of operations\nmay not be necessarily indicative of our future results of operations. Factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include the following:\n• changes in demand for programmatic advertising and for our platform, including related to the seasonal nature of our clients’ spending on\ndigital advertising campaigns;\n• changes to availability of and pricing of competitive products and services, and their effects on our pricing;\n• changes in the pricing, cost or availability of data, value-added services, or underlying third-party services, including pricing structure\nchanges and the alignment of our pricing model with our data partners;\n• changes in our client base and platform or related offerings;\n• the addition or loss of advertising agencies and advertisers as clients;\n• changes in advertising budget allocations, agency affiliations or marketing strategies;\n• changes to our product, media, client or channel mix;\n• changes and uncertainty in the regulatory environment for us, advertisers, inventory providers, or others in the advertising industry, and the\neffects of our efforts and those of our clients and partners to address changes and uncertainty in the regulatory environment;\n• changes in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy generally, which could alter advertisers’ budgets or spending priorities, or\ncould increase the time or costs required to complete advertising inventory sales;\n• changes in the pricing and availability of advertising inventory, including through real-time advertising exchanges or in the cost of reaching\nend consumers through digital advertising;\n• disruptions, outages, vulnerabilities or technological issues uncovered on our platform or related offerings;\n• factors beyond our control, such as natural disasters, terrorism, war and public health crises;\n• the introduction of new technologies or offerings by our competitors or others in the advertising marketplace;\n• changes in our capital expenditures as we acquire the hardware, equipment and other assets required to support our business;\n39\nTable of Contents\n• timing differences between our payments for advertising inventory and our collection of related advertising revenue;\n• the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n• costs related to acquisitions of businesses or technologies and development of new products;\n• cost of employee recruiting and retention; and\n• changes to the cost of infrastructure, including real estate and information technology.\nBased upon the factors above and others beyond our control, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses. If we fail to\nmeet or exceed the operating results expectations of analysts and investors or if analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance\nthat are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us\nadversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. In the past, companies that have experienced\nvolatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns.\nIf we fail to offer sufficient client training and support, our business and reputation would suffer.\nBecause we offer a self-service platform, client training and support is important for the successful marketing and continued use of our platform and\nfor maintaining and increasing spend through our platform from existing and new clients. Providing this training and support requires that our platform\noperations personnel have specific domain knowledge and expertise along with the ability to train others, which makes it more difficult for us to hire qualified\npersonnel and to scale up our support operations due to the extensive training required. The importance of high-quality client service will increase as we\nexpand our business and pursue new clients. If we are not responsive and proactive regarding our clients’ advertising needs, or do not provide effective support\nfor our clients’ advertising campaigns, our ability to retain our existing clients would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential clients would be\nharmed, which would negatively impact our business.\nIf the non-proprietary technology, software, products and services that we use are unavailable, have future terms we cannot agree to, or do not perform as\nwe expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe depend on various technology, software, products and services from third parties or available as open source, including data centers and API\ntechnology, payment processing, payroll and other technology and professional services, some of which are critical to the features and functionality of our\nplatform. For example, in order for clients to target ads in ways they desire and otherwise optimize and verify campaigns, our platform must have access to data\nregarding Internet user behavior and reports with demographic information regarding Internet users. Identifying, negotiating, complying with and integrating\nwith third-party terms and technology are complex, costly and time-consuming matters. Failure by third-party providers to maintain, support or secure their\ntechnology either generally or for our accounts specifically, or downtime, errors or defects in their products or services, could adversely impact our platform,\nour administrative obligations or other areas of our business. Having to replace any third-party providers or their technology, products or services could result\nin outages or difficulties in our ability to provide our services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with our third-party\nproviders or otherwise need to replace them, internal resources may need to be diverted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nharmed.\nDisruptions to service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing and hosting providers could impair the delivery of our\nservices and harm our business.\nA significant portion of our business relies upon hardware and services that are hosted, managed and controlled by third-party co-location providers\nfor our data centers, and we are dependent on these third parties to provide continuous power, cooling, Internet connectivity and physical and technological\nsecurity for our servers. In the event that these third-party providers experience any interruption in operations or cease business for any reason, or if we are\nunable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued hosting relationships, we would be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume\nsome hosting responsibilities ourselves. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on marketplace activities and could result in a\nloss of revenue. These facilities may be located in areas prone to natural disasters and may experience catastrophic events such as earthquakes, fires, floods,\npower loss,\n40\nTable of Contents\ntelecommunications failures, public health crises and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism,\ncyberattacks and similar misconduct. Although we have made certain disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, such events could cause damage\nto, or failure of, our systems generally, or those of the third-party cloud computing and hosting providers, which could result in disruptions to our service.\nWe face potential liability and harm to our business based on the human factor of inputting information into our platform.\nCampaigns are set up using several variables available to our clients on our platform. While our platform includes several checks and balances, it is\npossible for human error to result in significant overspending. The system requires a daily cap at the ad group level. We also provide for the client to input daily\nand overall caps at the advertising inventory campaign level at their discretion. Additionally, we set a credit limit for each user so that they cannot spend\nbeyond the level of credit risk we are willing to accept. Despite these protections, the ability for overspend exists. For example, campaigns which last for a\nperiod of time can be set to pace evenly or as quickly as possible. If a client with a high credit limit enters the wrong daily cap with a campaign set to a rapid\npace, it is possible for a campaign to accidently go significantly over budget. While our client contracts state that clients are responsible for media purchased\nthrough our platform, we are ultimately responsible for paying the inventory providers, and we may be unable to collect from clients facing such issues, in\nwhich case our results of operations would be harmed.\nWe have international operations and plan to continue expanding abroad where we have more limited operating experience, which may subject us to\nadditional cost and economic risks that can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations and expansion plans create challenges associated with supporting a rapidly growing business across a multitude of\ncultures, customs, monetary, legal and regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. We have a limited operating history outside of the United States, and\nour ability to manage and expand our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable attention and resources.\nWe have personnel in countries within North America, Central America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and we are continuing to expand our international\noperations. Some of the countries into which we are, or potentially may, expand score unfavorably on the Corruption Perceptions Index (“CPI”) of the\nTransparency International. Our teams in locations outside the United States are substantially smaller than some of our teams in the United States. To the extent\nwe are unable to effectively engage with non-U.S. advertising agencies or international divisions of U.S. agencies due to our limited sales force capacity, or we\nare unable to secure quality non-U.S. ad inventory and data on reasonable terms due to our limited inventory and data team capacity, we may be unable to\neffectively grow in international markets.\nOur international operations and expansion subject us to a variety of additional risks, including:\n• risks related to local advertising markets, where adoption of programmatic ad buying may be slower than in the United States, advertising\nbuyers and inventory and data providers may be less familiar with demand-side platforms and our brand, and business models may not\nsupport our value proposition;\n• exposure to public health issues and to travel restrictions and other measures undertaken by governments in response to such issues;\n• risks related to compliance with local laws and regulations, including those relating to privacy, cybersecurity, data security, antitrust, data\nlocalization, anti-bribery, import and export controls, economic sanctions (including to existing and potential partners and clients), tax and\nwithholding (including overlapping of different tax regimes), and varied labor and employment laws (including those relating to termination\nof employees); corporate formation, partnership, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment and other regulatory limitations or\nobligations on our operations (such as obtaining requisite licenses or other governmental requirements); and the increased administrative\ncosts and risks associated with such compliance;\n• operational and execution risk, and other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences, which may burden management,\nincrease travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs, and add complexity to our enforcement of advertising standards across languages\nand countries;\n• geopolitical and social factors, such as concerns regarding negative, unstable or changing economic conditions in the countries and regions\nwhere we operate, recessions, armed conflicts and wars, political instability and trade disputes;\n41\nTable of Contents\n• risks related to pricing structure, payment and currency, including aligning our pricing model and payment terms with local norms, higher\nlevels of credit risk and payment fraud, difficulties in invoicing and collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure,\nand difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies; and\n• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual\nproperty rights abroad.\nWe have a U.K. entity through which we have entered into international client and partner agreements, including with those in the EU, which are\ngoverned by English Law, and some of our clients and partners pay us in British Pounds and Euros.\nWe may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our international operations and expansion, and we may not be successful. Our international\nbusiness also subjects us to the impact of differing regulatory requirements, costs and difficulties in managing a distributed workforce, and potentially adverse\ntax consequences in the United States and abroad. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future international laws or\nregulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our business in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial\npenalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to restructure operations or shut down entirely. In addition, advertising markets outside of the United States are\nnot as developed as those within the United States, and we may be unable to grow our business sufficiently. Any failure to successfully manage the risks and\nchallenges related to our international operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, credit facilities which may contain operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and\nfinancing activities.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, credit facilities which contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future credit facility may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.\nSubject to exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n• sell assets or make changes to the nature of our business;\n• engage in mergers or acquisitions;\n• incur, assume or permit additional indebtedness and guarantees;\n• make restricted payments, including paying dividends on, repurchasing, redeeming or making distributions with respect to our capital stock;\n• make specified investments;\n• engage in transactions with our affiliates; and\n• make payments in respect of subordinated debt.\nOur obligations under our credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of substantially all of our assets, including accounts receivable, deposit\naccounts, intellectual property and investment property and equipment. The covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to take actions and, in the\nevent that we breach one or more covenants, our lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts\noutstanding, terminate the commitment to extend further credit and foreclose on the collateral granted to them to collateralize such indebtedness, which\nincludes our intellectual property. In addition, if we fail to meet the required covenants, we will not have access to further draw-downs under our credit facility.\nIf we do not effectively grow and train our sales and client service teams, we may be unable to add new clients or increase sales to our existing clients and\nour business will be adversely affected.\nWe are substantially dependent on our sales and client service teams to obtain new clients and to increase spend by our existing clients. We believe\nthat there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will\ndepend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, hiring, training, integrating and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth in the\nUnited States and internationally. Due to the complexity of our platform, new hires require significant training, and it may take significant time before they\nachieve full productivity. Our account managers, for instance, need to be trained quickly on the\n42\nTable of Contents\nfeatures of our platform since failure to offer high-quality support may adversely affect our relationships with our clients. Our recent and planned hires may not\nbecome productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do\nbusiness or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in\nobtaining new clients or increasing our existing clients’ spend with us, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we are unable to maintain it as we grow, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be harmed.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience rapid expansion of our employee ranks. We believe our corporate culture has been a key\nelement of our success. However, as our organization grows and expands globally, it may be difficult to maintain our culture, which could reduce our ability to\ninnovate and operate effectively. The failure to maintain the key aspects of our culture as our organization grows could result in decreased employee\nsatisfaction, increased difficulty in attracting top talent, increased turnover and could compromise the quality of our client service, all of which are important to\nour success and to the effective execution of our business strategy. In the event we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we grow to scale, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our technology without compensating us, thereby\neroding our competitive advantages and harming our business.\nWe rely upon a combination of trade secrets, third-party confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, additional contractual restrictions on\ndisclosure and use, and trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures\nand restrictions provide only limited protection. We currently have “theTradeDesk” and variants and other marks registered as trademarks or pending\nregistrations in the United States and certain foreign countries. We also rely on copyright laws to protect computer programs related to our platform and our\nproprietary technologies, although to date we have not registered for statutory copyright protection. We have registered numerous Internet domain names in the\nUnited States and certain foreign countries related to our business. We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors in order to limit\naccess to and disclosure of our proprietary information, as well as to clarify rights to intellectual property associated with our business. Protecting our\nintellectual property is a challenge, especially after our employees or our contractors end their relationship with us, and, in some cases, decide to work for our\ncompetitors. Our contracts with our employees and contractors that relate to intellectual property issues generally restrict the use of our confidential\ninformation solely in connection with our services, and strictly prohibit reverse engineering. However, reverse engineering our software or the theft or misuse\nof our proprietary information could occur by employees or other third parties who have access to our technology. Enforceability of the non-compete\nagreements that we have in place is not guaranteed, and contractual restrictions could be breached without discovery or adequate remedies. Historically, we\nhave prioritized keeping our technology architecture, trade secrets and engineering roadmap private, and as a general matter, have not patented our proprietary\ntechnology. As a result, we cannot look to patent enforcement rights to protect much of our proprietary technology. Furthermore, our patent strategy is still in\nits early stages. We may not be able to obtain any further patents, and our pending applications may not result in the issuance of patents. Any issued patents\nmay be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or\ncompetitive advantages to us. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute\nall necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual\nproperty rights as those of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of our proprietary rights in such countries may be inadequate. If we are unable to\nprotect our proprietary rights (including in particular, the proprietary aspects of our platform) we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others\nwho have not incurred the same level of expense, time and effort to create and protect their intellectual property.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which would result in additional expense and potential damages.\nThere is significant patent and other intellectual property development activity in the digital advertising industry. Third-party intellectual property\nrights may cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from expanding our offerings. Our success depends on the continual\ndevelopment of our platform. From time to time, we may receive claims from third parties that our platform and underlying technology infringe or violate such\nthird parties’ intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject\n43\nTable of Contents\nof intellectual property claims. The cost of defending against such claims, whether or not the claims have merit, is significant, regardless of whether we are\nsuccessful in our defense, and could divert the attention of management, technical personnel and other employees from our business operations. Litigation\nregarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such\nmatters. Additionally, we have obligations to indemnify our clients or inventory and data suppliers in connection with certain intellectual property claims. If we\nare found to infringe these rights, we could potentially be required to cease utilizing portions of our platform. We may also be required to develop alternative\nnon-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. Additionally, we could be required to pay royalty payments, either as a one-time\nfee or ongoing, as well as damages for past use that was deemed to be infringing. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect\nof our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business.\nWe face potential liability and harm to our business based on the nature of our business and the content on our platform.\nAdvertising often results in litigation relating to misleading or deceptive claims, copyright or trademark infringement, public performance royalties or\nother claims based on the nature and content of advertising that is distributed through our platform. Though we contractually require clients to generally\nrepresent to us that their advertisements comply with our ad standards and our inventory providers’ ad standards and that they have the rights necessary to serve\nadvertisements through our platform, we do not independently verify whether we are permitted to deliver, or review the content of, such advertisements. If any\nof these representations are untrue, we may be exposed to potential liability and our reputation may be damaged. While our clients are typically obligated to\nindemnify us, such indemnification may not fully cover us, or we may not be able to collect. In addition to settlement costs, we may be responsible for our own\nlitigation costs, which can be expensive.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery, anti-corruption and similar laws and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines\nand harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute\ncontained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the USA PATRIOT Act, U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption laws have been enforced with great rigor in\nrecent years and are interpreted broadly. Such laws prohibit companies and their employees and their agents from making or offering improper payments or\nother benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, particularly in countries with a low\nscore on the CPI by Transparency International, and increase our use of third parties such as sales agents, distributors, resellers or consultants, our risks under\nthese laws will increase. We adopt appropriate policies and procedures and conduct training, but cannot guarantee that improprieties will not occur.\nNoncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits,\nsignificant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with specified persons, the loss of\nexport privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. Any investigations, actions and/or sanctions could have a\nmaterial negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental economic sanctions requirements and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets or subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nAs a U.S. company, we are subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations, and we are required to export our technology\nand services in compliance with those laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and economic embargo and trade sanctions\nprograms administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations\nprohibit the shipment of specified products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we take precautions to\nprevent doing any business, directly or indirectly, with countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions and to ensure that our technology and\nservices are not exported or used by countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, such measures may be circumvented. There can be no\nassurance that we will be in compliance with U.S. export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations in the future. Any such violation could result in\nsignificant criminal or civil fines, penalties or other sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm that could materially adversely impact our\nbusiness.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if we export our technology, the exports may require authorizations, including a license, a license exception or other appropriate\ngovernment authorization. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of\nopportunities.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of encryption technology, including the imposition of import permitting and licensing requirements,\nand have enacted laws that could limit our ability to offer our platform or could limit our clients’ ability to use our platform in those countries. Changes in our\nplatform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our platform in international markets or prevent our clients\nwith international operations from deploying our platform globally. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or\nchange in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our\ndecreased ability to export our technology and services to, existing or potential clients with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or\nlimitation on our ability to export our platform would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell\nyour shares at or above your purchase price.\nThe market price of our stock and of equity securities of technology companies has historically experienced high levels of volatility. If you purchase\nshares of our Class A common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above your purchase price. The market price of our Class A common stock\nhas fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating\nperformance, including:\n• announcements of new offerings, products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our\ncompetitors;\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n• significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the digital advertising\nindustry in particular;\n• fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program;\n• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n• actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n• litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n• regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n• general economic conditions and trends;\n• terrorist attacks, political upheaval, natural disasters, war, public health crises, or other major catastrophic events;\n• sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n• departures of key employees; or\n• an adverse impact on us from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the stock market for technology companies, or the stock market generally, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Stock prices of many technology\ncompanies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past,\nstockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our core business, and adversely affect our business.\n45\nTable of Contents\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors,\nexecutive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nAdditionally, our directors, executive officers, employees and, in certain instances, service providers, hold shares of common stock subject to\noutstanding options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans. Those shares and the shares reserved for future issuance\nunder our equity incentive plans are and will become eligible for sale in the public market, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nInsiders have substantial control over our company, including as a result of the dual class structure of our common stock, which could limit your ability to\ninfluence the outcome of key decisions, including a change of control.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio\nbetween our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively have substantial control of the combined voting power\nof our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that all Class B common stock will convert automatically into Class A common stock on\nDecember 22, 2025, unless converted prior to such date. As of September 30, 2024, stockholders who held shares of Class B common stock, including our\nexecutive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together held approximately 49.4% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. This\nconcentrated control limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters, as the holders of Class B common stock are able to influence or\nsubstantially control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of the directors, excluding the director we have designated as a\nClass A director, and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Their interests may differ from yours and they may vote in a\nmanner that is adverse to your interests. This ownership concentration may deter, delay or prevent a change of control of our company, deprive our\nstockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may ultimately affect the market price of our\ncommon stock. Furthermore, in connection with the dual class nature of our common stock, we have become subject to legal proceedings and could become\ninvolved in additional litigation, including securities class action claims and/or derivative litigation. Any such legal proceedings, regardless of outcome or\nmerit, may divert management’s time and attention and may result in the incurrence of significant expense, including legal fees. For additional information\nregarding the pending legal proceedings, refer to “Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,\nsuch as transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. However, until the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock, the\nconversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class B\ncommon stock who retain their shares in the long term.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and other corporate governance changes.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our\nboard of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include the following provisions:\n• permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n• provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes with staggered, three-year terms and that directors may only be\nremoved for cause;\n• require super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n• specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our\nchief executive officer, or a stockholder that has held at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock continuously for one year;\n46\nTable of Contents\n• provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n• provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n• prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n• restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n• restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to the federal district courts of the United States;\n• permit our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n• reflect the dual class structure of our common stock, as discussed above; and\n• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon\nby stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a period of time.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws designate certain state or federal courts as the exclusive forum for\ncertain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claim for:\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n• any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders to us or our\nstockholders;\n• any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court\nof Chancery of the State of Delaware; or\n• any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (collectively, the “Delaware Forum Provision”).\nThe Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Further, our amended and\nrestated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America\nwill be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). In\naddition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise\nacquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum\nProvision, respectively; provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may limit our\nstockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees (including, without\nlimitation, any claims in respect of stockholder nominations of directors as permitted under our amended and restated bylaws), which may discourage the filing\nof lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the\nDelaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in\nfederal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal\nForum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Federal Forum Provision may also\nimpose additional litigation costs on stockholders who\n47\nTable of Contents\nassert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts may also reach different\njudgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring\nthe action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated, that it will enhance long-term stockholder value, or that it will\nsuccessfully mitigate the dilutive effect of employee equity awards. Share repurchases diminish our cash reserves and could also increase the volatility of\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWhile our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to acquire\nany particular amount of Class A common stock and it may be terminated at any time. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated, that it\nwill enhance long-term stockholder value, or that it will successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of employee equity awards. Any repurchases will reduce the\namount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate\nrequirements. In addition, the program could affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a\ntermination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our\nfinancial condition or results of operations. If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it may adversely affect investor confidence in us\nand the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal\ncontrol. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting.\nOur platform system applications are complex, multi-faceted and include applications that are highly customized in order to serve and support our\nclients, advertising inventory and data suppliers, as well as support our financial reporting obligations. We regularly make improvements to our platform to\nmaintain and enhance our competitive position. In the future, we may implement new offerings and engage in business transactions, such as acquisitions,\nreorganizations or implementation of new information systems.\nThese factors require us to develop and maintain our internal controls, processes and reporting systems, and we expect to incur ongoing costs in this effort. We\nmay not be successful in developing and maintaining effective internal controls, and any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties\nencountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a\nrestatement of our financial statements for prior periods.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, if our independent registered public accounting\nfirm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, then, we may be late with the filing of our periodic reports, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and\ncompleteness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. Such failures could also subject us to\ninvestigations by Nasdaq, the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and to litigation from stockholders,\nwhich could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our core business.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable\nsecurities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more\ndifficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange\n48\nTable of Contents\nAct requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Significant resources and management oversight are required to maintain and, if required,\nimprove our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management’s attention may be\ndiverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nExposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhile the majority of the transactions through our platform are denominated in U.S. Dollars, we have transacted in foreign currencies, both for\ninventory and data and for payments by clients from use of our platform. We also have expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Given\nour anticipated international growth, we expect the number of transactions in a variety of foreign currencies to continue to grow in the future. While we\ngenerally require a fee from our clients that pay in non-U.S. currency, this fee may not always cover foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition,\nfor those clients that pay in non-U.S. currency, we often pay for the advertising inventory and data purchased by such clients in U.S. Dollars. As a result, any\nincrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies could cause our revenue to decline relative to our costs. Although we currently have a\nprogram to hedge exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, the use of hedging instruments may not be available for all currencies or may not always offset\nlosses resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments can itself result in losses if we are unable to\nstructure effective hedges with such instruments.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments or alliances could disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe explore, on an ongoing basis, potential acquisitions of companies or technologies, strategic investments, or alliances to strengthen our business;\nhowever, we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating businesses, products and technologies. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition\ncandidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems,\nliabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality\nor architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or client issues. Acquisitions involve numerous\nrisks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n• regulatory hurdles;\n• anticipated benefits may not materialize;\n• diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n• retention of employees from the acquired company;\n• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n• integration of the acquired company’s products and technology;\n• integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n• the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked effective\ncontrols, procedures and policies;\n• coordination of product development and sales and marketing functions;\n• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including relating to privacy and data security, patent and trademark\ninfringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, users, former stockholders or other\nthird parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to such acquisitions and strategic investments could result in reducing or\ncompletely eliminating any anticipated benefits of transactions, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of\nour equity securities, the incurrence of debt,\n49\nTable of Contents\ncontingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs, which may in turn impair our growth.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business, which will require additional capital to develop new features or enhance our platform, improve our\noperating infrastructure, finance working capital requirements, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We cannot assure you that our business\nwill generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing credit facility in an amount sufficient to\nfund our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional capital. We cannot assure you\nthat we would be able to locate additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve\nrestrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain\nadditional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If our cash flows and credit facility borrowings are insufficient to fund our working capital\nrequirements, we may not be able to grow at the rate we currently expect or at all. In addition, in the absence of sufficient cash flows from operations, we might\nbe unable to meet our obligations under our credit facility, and we may therefore be at risk of default thereunder. If we raise additional funds through future\nissuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have\nrights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to secure additional funding on favorable terms, or at all,\nwhen we require it, our ability to continue to grow our business to react to market conditions could be impaired and our business may be harmed.\nOur tax liabilities may be greater than anticipated.\nThe U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws applicable to our business activities are subject to interpretation and are changing. We are subject to audit by the\nInternal Revenue Service and by taxing authorities of the state, local and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax obligations are based in part on our\ncorporate operating structure, including the manner in which we develop, value, use and hold our intellectual property, the jurisdictions in which we operate,\nhow tax authorities assess revenue-based taxes such as sales and use taxes, the scope of our international operations and the value we ascribe to our\nintercompany transactions. Taxing authorities may challenge, and have challenged, our tax positions and methodologies for valuing developed technology or\nintercompany arrangements, positions regarding the collection of sales and use taxes, and the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxes, which could expose\nus to additional taxes. Any adverse outcomes of such challenges to our tax positions could result in additional taxes for prior periods, interest and penalties, as\nwell as higher future taxes. In addition, our future tax expense could increase as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles, or as a\nresult of earning income in jurisdictions that have higher tax rates. For example, the European Commission has proposed, and various jurisdictions, including a\nnumber of states in the United States, are considering enacting or have enacted laws that impose separate taxes on specified digital services, which may\nincrease our tax obligations in such jurisdictions. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) announced an Inclusive\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, including Pillar Two Model Rules defining a global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large\nmultinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. While the changes from these rules have not impacted our financial condition or results of operations,\nthey could increase our effective tax rate and cash tax payments in future periods. Any increase in our tax expense could have a negative effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Moreover, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant estimates and\njudgment by management, and the tax treatment of certain transactions is uncertain. Any changes, ambiguity, or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, including, the position of taxing authorities with respect to revenue generated by reference to\ncertain digital services, could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. Although we believe we will make reasonable estimates and judgments, the\nultimate outcome of any particular issue may differ from the amounts previously recorded in our financial statements and any such occurrence could materially\naffect our financial condition and results of operations.\n50\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

On February 15, 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional $647 million under this program,\nbringing the total amount available for future repurchases back to $700 million. The share repurchase program is designed to help offset the impact of future share dilution from employee\nstock issuances. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases determined\nat our discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases are structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including\nwithin the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares\nunder this authorization. The program does not obligate us to acquire a minimum amount of Class A common stock, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the\ndiscretion of our board of directors. See Note 7—Capitalization in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to share repurchases.\n(2) Excludes other costs such as broker commissions and the accrued excise tax imposed by the IRA.\nItem 5. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nOur Section 16 officers and directors (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the “Exchange Act”) may from time\nto time enter into plans for the purchase or sale of Company stock that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c)\nunder the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1(c)”).\nOn August 22, 2024, our Chief Strategy Officer and Class II Director, Samantha Jacobson, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy the\naffirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to 111,088 shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate at the\nearlier of the execution of all trading orders in the plan or November 28, 2025.\nOn September 12, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Class I Director, Jeff T. Green, through a personal trust over which he is a trustee and\nthrough a foundation for which he is the sole member and director, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of\nRule 10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to 6,600,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The plan will terminate at the earlier of the execution of all trading\norders in the plan or June 30, 2025.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our Section 16 officers or directors adopted or terminated a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\n51\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

With that, I'll now turn\nthe call over to Co-Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n2 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nJeff Green, Founder and CEO\nThanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today.\nAs you have seen from our press release, we again posted very strong growth in the third\nquarter. Our revenue grew 27% compared with Q3 last year, marking strong revenue growth\nacceleration on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Quarter after quarter, we continue\nto gain market share, outpacing the industry and our peers both large and small.\nEven though it is now a considerable part of our business, CTV continues to be our fastest-\ngrowing channel. And it shows no sign of slowing down. Partners like Disney, NBCU, Walmart,\nRoku, LG, Netflix and many others are deepening their relationships with us around the growing\nCTV opportunity. I could not be more excited about our position in CTV and the size of the\ngrowth opportunity for us in the years ahead.\nWith our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, identity, measurement\nand data, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing\nmore multi-year joint business plans with leading agencies and brands. In fact, over 40% of our\nbusiness this year will fall under JBPs, representing spend projections in future years well into\nthe billions of dollars.\nI have great optimism that The Trade Desk will continue to outperform the market and gain\nsignificant share. Exiting this year, we are set up exceptionally well for 2025 and beyond, as we\ncontinue to execute in areas such as CTV, retail media and in markets outside of the United\nStates.\nI want to start the core of my remarks by explaining why I believe our industry is changing at an\nunprecedented rate. I believe there is more opportunity for The Trade Desk than ever before.\nBut in order to understand the significance of our opportunity, we have to contextualize the\n3 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nmacro changes and their effects on media, ad tech, and the biggest forces in digital\nadvertising.\nLet’s go through 10 significant landscape changes and why these are creating what we see as\nsustainable secular tail winds for The Trade Desk—so long as we can navigate changing\nconditions and position ourselves and our clients to benefit from the changes.\nThe first significant landscape vector that is creating a tailwind for The Trade Desk is the macro\nenvironment itself, that those of you listening or reading this know all too well. The Fed has\nbeen fighting inflation by raising rates. One simple way to frame this relevance to our world is\nthat inflation is measured primarily using price increases implemented by our clients on\nproducts we advertise for around the world. The change in fiscal and monetary policies around\nthe world mean the consumer has been forced to reconsider the cost benefit of every product\nthey buy. Advertising plays a bigger role in establishing which brands and which products win\nmarket share and which lose market share.\nThe second significant macro vector is related— and that’s that CMOs have more pressure\nthan ever to produce real growth and prove it with data. While there has been a lot of macro\nfocus on the reduction in inflation rates, historic highs for stock market indices, and growing\nindications of a soft landing – that’s not necessarily translating to consumer confidence.\nWhich is why CMOs are becoming much more closely aligned with their CFOs. CFOs want\nmore evidence than ever that marketing is working – and for CFOs that doesn’t just mean\ntraditional marketing KPIs – it means growing the top-line business. All of our AI and data\nscience injection into Kokai, our latest product release, is encouraging CMOs and CFOs to lean\nmore and more on TTD to deliver real, measured growth.\n4 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nThe third macro tailwind that setting up The Trade Desk for continued outsize gains is the\nmove to AI. Every company needs an AI strategy. Our AI product, Koa, is a great co-pilot for\ntraders—but this is only the beginning.\nThere are endless possibilities for us as we have one of the best data assets on internet—the\nlearnings that come from buying the global open internet outside of walled gardens.\nTo win in this new frontier, we’re looking across our entire suite of products, algorithms, and\nfeatures and asking how they all can be advanced by AI. We have teams focused on incubation\nand we’ve developed team structures to create checks and balances among our distributed\ndevelopment teams. This way we know the effect of complex AI products and measure the\noutputs and inputs of each of them.\nWe expect to talk about these efforts and their results over the coming quarters and years.\nWe’re positioned to benefit from our objectivity, our focus, our scale, and loyalty of our buyers.\nWe’re already seeing the results of Kokai performance today, but we’re just getting started.\nThe fourth vector that is changing the entire landscape of digital advertising and ad tech are\nthe of the changes happening at Google.\nGoogle has an incredibly dominant, money-making business in Search and another in\nYouTube. They also have an incredible opportunity in Cloud and AI, most notably in Gemini.\nBecause of the AI race in big tech and these opportunities, Google could continue to\ndowngrade their network business to focus on those prospects. After all, they operate at a\ndisadvantage in the large buyers of the buy-side of the open internet to The Trade Desk,\nbecause Google lacks objectivity. If these pressures weren’t enough on Google, they also have\na pending anti-trust trial that has created massive ripples throughout the global ad tech\necosystem. The outcome of the trial itself is less important than the change in behavior that will\nlikely come at Google no matter what. Whatever the outcome of the trial, I do believe that\n5 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nGoogle will become more cautious, if not less involved, in the part of their business where they\ncompete with us. First off, they are and will remain under tremendous scrutiny in this market,\nwhether it’s from US regulators or their many equivalents around the world. By contrast, the\nconvoluted role they play, laid out very clearly by the US Department of Justice, in their Network\nbusiness, is likely to play more fairly—one way or another.\nI point this out because it presents tremendous opportunity for our business, and for the\nbroader ad tech ecosystem. I have never been more excited about the value of the premium\ncontent at scale on the open internet, combined with new approaches to performance efficacy\n– especially in contrast to the murkiness of cheap reach dynamics within walled gardens such\nas Google.\nThe fifth macro vector creating incremental secular tailwinds are changes in the market\ndynamics of CTV. It’s hard not to be bullish about CTV when it’s both our largest channel and\nour fastest growing. Advertisers can see more clearly the contrast of our offering and the role\nwe play with brands and agencies with walled gardens than ever before.\nThis year we’ve really started showcasing the strengths of the Sellers and Publishers available\non our platform and on the Open Internet. We even published a list of 100 of the best\ndestinations on the Open Internet. When you contrast the quality of the Open Internet with\nperils of UGC, it’s easy to see that the best of movies, the best of TV, the best of sports, the\nbest of journalism, and the best of music and podcasts represent something much more\nvaluable to society and to advertisers than short videos and UGC surrounded by comment\nsections that are often not good for brands.\nAt The Trade Desk, we’ve also been talking a lot about the premium, open internet because\nthat is where consumers are increasingly spending most of their time. Companies like Netflix,\n6 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nRoku, NBC, Spotify, Disney and Fox, along with many others, have redefined the consumer’s\ninternet experience over the last few years.\nThey all recognize the power of advertising to fund the amazing content experiences that their\nconsumers have now come to expect and they are all investing in the capabilities to capitalize\non advertiser demand.\nThis point is worth reiterating because of some of the macro inventory dynamics in digital\nadvertising. You may recall 3 or 4 years ago I would talk on these calls about inventory scarcity,\nespecially in CTV in the fourth quarter, which was enjoying a significant surge because of\npeople spending more time streaming at home during the global pandemic.\nAs advertisers chased those viewer eyeballs to new streaming platforms, advertising inventory\nwas scarce -- and with demand rising, CPMs went up.\nBut CTV inventory isn’t scarce in the same way anymore. Because over the last couple of years,\nevery major media company has launched a streaming service, and all of them have embraced\nadvertising as a key way to fund their content and grow.\nAs inventory scales and scarcity decreases, advertisers have a lot more choice. They also have\na harder job, which is assigning value to a lot more inventory. Now, it's about the quality of the\ninventory as well as the quality of the signal.\nYou may remember at our last investor day – we showed a graph of what our clients were\nwilling to pay for CTV ad impressions on the open market -- in many cases we bid significantly\nhigher than the price that media companies were negotiating in direct deals.\nThe content arms race is more intense, and more expensive, than ever and media companies\nneed to monetize their content as effectively as possible. Two weeks ago Variety reported that\n7 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nthe top 6 media companies will increase content spending this year by 9 percent, to a record\n$126 billion. All of which needs to be funded.\nWithout the benefit of scarcity, media companies now need to provide advertisers with more\ninsight. What am I buying? Who am I reaching? Tools like UID2 and OpenPath are helping\nprovide that signal. And it’s no surprise that platforms like FOX, who were among the first to\nembrace these tools, are benefitting the most. One major news publisher, who has deployed\nOpenPath so they can gain a clearer understanding of what our clients are willing to pay, saw\ntheir fill rate increase 7x leading to a revenue increase of more than 25%.\nThe sixth positive secular force helping The Trade Desk is pressure to make the supply chain\nbetter. Advertisers and Publishers are the two end points of the supply chain. And pressure on\nthe edges (meaning the end points) means pressure on the whole supply chain. How this is\ngood for us is perhaps counter-intuitive. There are many players in Ad Tech that are focused on\nextracting the highest margin possible. In contrast, we have been focused on adding more\nvalue than we cost or charge. We do this because it is the right thing to do, because it\nengenders loyalty from our clients, and because it is the very essence of economically\nsustainable.\nAt this moment, the advertising ecosystem is in the process of refining its supply chain to\nbecome definitively more efficient than walled gardens, with more objective and independent\nmeasurement to prove its efficacy. Companies focused on extraction will likely lose share.\nWhile companies focused on adding value, will likely gain market share.\nThere are many in our industry who share the ethos to add value—and we’re aiming to partner\nwith nearly all of them. However, there are many that don’t -- Some who take a more short-\nterm approach and are just looking for arbitrage opportunities or places where they can create\nthe quick illusion of value at the expense of agencies, advertisers or sellers and publishers.\n8 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nI do believe, like most markets, that ad tech will go through a long arc that will bend toward\nmarket efficiency and transparency. It’s just a question of how quickly we get there. And in this\nmoment, we have an opportunity to accelerate that progress. There will be more focus than\never on who is adding value and at what cost to advertisers and sellers and publishers.\nConsider the potential prioritization changes happing at Google. In a world where Google is\nmore cautious on the open internet, a brighter light will shine on the value that everyone\nprovides in the ad tech supply chain. I have long said that everyone in our industry should\nprovide more value to the market than they extract. That’s a principle we have always followed.\nAdvertisers are under more pressure than ever to do more with less. Sellers and Publishers,\nwhich is our terms for content owners and the companies who own that content, are fighting\nharder than ever take home as much of the CPM as possible and simultaneously increase their\nfill rates.\nAnd they want the advertising ecosystem to be as efficient and transparent as possible. That’s\nwhy most are so eager to partner with us on initiatives like UID2 and OpenPath. So they can\nprovide advertisers with as much signal and transparency as possible, and so advertisers can\nvalue their ad impressions as accurately as possible in the context of reaching their target\naudiences.\nThe seventh macro vector that I want to talk about today are the trends happening in Audio.\nI want to highlight that many have wrongly defined the advertising TAM of audio to some sort\nof comparison to legacy radio. Because the biggest players in audio are global and because\ndigital provides potential for far fewer and more relevant ads, I’m convinced if the biggest\nplayers move correctly, they can capture one of the biggest opportunities in advertising and\nmedia today— which is the delta between time spent in the audio channel and the amount of\nad budgets heading to the channel.\n9 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nDigital audio is at the early stages of its evolution. The channel is in a similar position to where\nCTV was a few years ago. Consumers in the US spend an average of 3 hours per day\nconsuming digital audio, up significantly over the last 5 years, and advertisers are eager to\ncapitalize on this emerging advertising channel.\nAt the moment advertisers are looking for clear trusted signals to inform what they buy. “Trust\nbut verify” has become a mantra around the Open Internet.\nJust a few of weeks ago, media reported on our major, expanded partnership with Spotify. They\nwill be deploying both UID2 and OpenPath, so that advertisers can find as much addressability\nand insight as possible for Spotify’s high value ad impressions. I don’t think there’s any\ncompany in the media universe that’s been more successful than Spotify at building a\nsubscription model. In the audio world, Spotify gives us access to almost all of the world’s\nmusic for a low monthly subscription. In many ways, Spotify has been at the forefront of this\nmass consumer shift to digital audio.\nI think they are in process of becoming well positioned to get incremental users due to a good\nad experience and to get incremental ad budgets for the exact same reason.\nYou only have to listen to their most recent earnings reports to understand how seriously they\nare taking the ad-supported side of their business and building out their programmatic\ncapabilities over the next several years. We are very excited to partner with them in this work\nand to help our advertiser clients make the most of this fast-growing channel where listeners\nare highly engaged and leaned-in.\nOur partnership with Spotify is one of the inventory partnerships that I’m most optimistic about.\nThe eighth macro vector aiding in our out-sized growth is the massive opportunity around\nretail media. To summarize this at a high-level. Amazon has showcased to retailers around the\n10 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nworld the benefit of using retail purchase data to make retail businesses work better. If\nadvertisers advertise products people like and want and frequently buy at their stores like\nWalmart or Target or Albertsons or Dollar General, those retailers sell more product. So do the\ncompanies making and selling the products. The significance of this vector and the role it’s\nplayed in our success the past few years deserves a much larger space of time, which I expect\nto do in the coming quarters.\nThe ninth macro tailwind is the changes in live sports. Of course, sports is some of the most\npremium and most expensive content in media. Because it is often scarce and often highly\nsought out by brands and it changes very quickly, it really is built for programmatic advertising.\nThe best moments in sports are surprises and unpredictable. That’s what makes them so\nexciting. However, it’s also what makes them hard to plan around and price properly. I expect\nover the coming years to see programmatic spot markets and sports become best friends.\nWe are enjoying our strongest year to date with live sports. As the football season has kicked\noff here in the U.S., we’re looking at, on average, 1.5 billion ad impressions per weekend. We\nhave dozens of major brands buying football through our platform for the first time, and many\nothers increasing spend in the triple digit range.\nOne example is a major quick serve restaurant chain here in the US. This client had been\nadvertising on traditional linear TV, but with its customer base mostly aged over 45 and\nrestaurant visits among that demographic decreasing, they wanted to expand their customer\nbase to reach younger adults and young families -- using CTV.\nWorking with their agency, Happy Cog, and their partner, Klever, this restaurant chain worked\nwith us to target their audience with a specific focus on live football opportunities on CTV,\nfollowed up with online video and display – all in an omnichannel approach.\n11 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nOur platform enabled the restaurant to target their audiences with precision and use new\nmeasurement tools to understand the impact of those ads on brand intent.\nAs a result, this client saw a 15% increase in brand awareness among their target audience, and\na 9% increase in mobile transactions where CTV was the first ad served. This is a great\nexample of how programmatic, on our platform, is driving high-value business results.\nThe tenth macro trend helping us grow, is net effect of all of these changes at once. I’ve said\npublicly a few times that the biggest thing Google has going for it in its defense against the\nDOJ is complexity. It’s hard to make sense of this industry and all of the forces changing it\nrapidly. Our clients need help. They are navigating unprecedented change and pressure.\nFortunately, our buy-side focus and our objectivity aligns our interests with clients and\npositions us to stand with agencies and brands shoulder to shoulder as we face supply chain\nchanges that ultimately benefit the open internet and the market, but will require adjustments\nacross the ecosystem. We’re here to help and have proven ourselves to be one of the leaders\nof the open internet.\nAll 10 of these macro forces—when joined with our amazing team, our global footprint, our buy-\nside focus, and our amazing product, including the recent platform overhaul found in Kokai—\nare showing the early signs of the future promise of our innovations, our objectivity, our AI, and\nour company.\nClients are seeing performance upgrades around the world, many of whom are embracing new\napproaches to objective, data-driven measurement The Trade Desk offers.\nAs we exit 2024 and look forward to 2025, The Trade Desk is better positioned than we have\never been.\n12 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\n2024 has been a banner year for CTV and we have further cemented our position as the first-\nchoice platform to help leading brands as they continue to shift their budgets from linear TV\nand UGC into CTV\nRetail media has rapidly become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business, a trend we\nexpect to accelerate through 2025. Retail data on our platform is transforming how many CPG\nadvertisers approach measurement and attribution.\nInnovations in Kokai are helping advertisers identify and target new potential customers with\nmuch greater precision. Data elements per impression continue to increase resulting in\nsignificantly better performance, helping unlock budgets and win new business;\nOur premium content partnerships, activated through supply path innovations such as\nOpenPath and the Sellers and Publishers 500 Plus marketplace, are helping advertisers value\nand select ad impressions with more objectivity than ever;\nInnovations like UID2, which has reached critical mass, are helping advertisers pioneer better\napproaches to addressability in a changing identity environment;\nAnd our investments in new measurement capabilities, from the TV Quality Index to our\ngrowing network of retail data partners, are helping advertisers prove the efficacy of their\ncampaigns in new, objective ways.\nLet me conclude by underlining that taken together, these initiatives, along with many others,\nposition The Trade Desk very well for market leading growth in the years ahead.\nI believe it is worth noting again we continue to significantly gain market share. I believe our\nlevel of relative outperformance, 27 percent revenue growth in the third quarter, is indicative of\nthe value we are delivering to our clients as they deal with an uncertain consumer environment.\nWe continue to sign JBP’s with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of\n13 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\ndollars transacted through these partnerships each year now. I believe we will look back on\n2024 as an inflection point in terms of how advertisers value the premium open internet –\ndriven by CTV and digital audio – as a compelling alternative to walled gardens. And I expect\nadvertisers will emerge in 2025 more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a\nresult, we will continue to gain share.\nAnd with that, I’ll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\n14 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nLaura Schenkein, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon.\nAs our third quarter results demonstrate, The Trade Desk is executing at a high level,\noutpacing peers, and capturing increased market share. We achieved robust, accelerating\nyear-over-year revenue growth, while delivering outstanding profitability and cash flow. Key\ninvestment initiatives, including performance advancements in our Kokai platform, expansion\nin CTV, retail media, and supply chain innovations like our OpenPath technology, are not only\nstrengthening our foundation but position us for durable growth in 2025 and beyond.\nTurning to our results, revenue in Q3 was $628 million representing growth of 27 percent year-\nover-year, accelerating from the prior quarter and year-over-year. We continue to win more\nshare of our clients’ advertising budgets as they increasingly prioritize platforms like The Trade\nDesk that deliver high-value results, especially in premium video and CTV. This trend is a\nfamiliar dynamic in our industry that we’ve witnessed many times over the years. When CMO’s\nface pressure to achieve more with less, they turn to platforms like ours for flexibility, precision\nand measurable results.\nDuring the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again.\nWe saw strong momentum in retail media, as we continue to win incremental shopper\nmarketing budgets. International spend growth outpaced North America, once again with\nnotably strong performance in CTV.\nWith the strong top-line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $257 million in\nadjusted EBITDA, or about 41 percent of revenue, and free cash flow of $222 million.\nFrom a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the\nthird quarter. In Q3, Video, which includes CTV, represented a high-40’s percentage share of\n15 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nour business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-\n30’s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low-\ndouble digit percent share of our business and Audio represented around 5 percent.\nGeographically, North America represented about 88 percent of our business in Q3 and\nInternational represented about 12 percent. We are pleased that our spend outside North\nAmerica grew at a faster rate year-over-year than inside North America, as has been the case\nfor the last seven quarters in a row. CTV continued to drive our growth across both EMEA and\nAsia-Pacific. We see significant opportunities to capture more share in these regions in the\nquarters and years ahead.\nIn terms of the verticals that represent at least 1 percent of our spend, growth was broad\nbased again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals,\nparticularly in Medical Health (which includes advertising related to healthcare and\npharmaceuticals) as well as Home & Garden, and Pets. Political spending was also strong in\nQ3, as expected. Family & Relationships and Healthy Living verticals were both below average.\nOverall, we saw healthy trends across categories, and we continue to believe there is\nopportunity for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve.\nTurning now to expenses.\nExcluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $391 million, up 24%\nyear-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform, and\nour infrastructure to support sustained growth.\nIncome tax expense was $33 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax\nprofitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.\n16 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nAdjusted Net Income was $207 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by\noperating activities was $273 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $222 million.\nDSOs exiting the quarter were 89 days, down 2 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days,\ndown 1 day from a year ago.\nIn Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased $54 million of Class A common\nstock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically, depending on\nmarket conditions and capital priorities.\nWe exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents\nand short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.7 billion. We have no debt on the balance\nsheet.\nTurning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas\nsuch as CTV, retail media and political. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $756 million\nwhich would represent growth of about 25 percent on a year-over-year basis. We estimate\nadjusted EBITDA to be approximately $363 million in Q4.\nIn closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, and we\nare cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to gain momentum across our biggest priorities,\ndelivering profitable growth and significant share gains. As we look ahead to the remainder of\nQ4 and 2025, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are today. With large\ngrowth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail\ndata, expansion outside North America, a strong identity framework, strengthening of the\nsupply chain, and the ability to drive leverage in out model, we remain optimistic for many\nyears to come.\n17 | P age\nThird Quarter 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks, November 7, 2024\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for\nquestions.\n18 | P age"
