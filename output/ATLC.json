          "content": "Empowering Better Financial Outcomes for Everyday Americans\n2023 Annual Report\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nAll statements in this Annual Report to Shareholders concerning our operating and financial results, business strategy, capital\ninvestment, liquidity, access to capital, demand for our products, product enhancements, growth opportunities, our auto-\nfinance segment, the competitive landscape, consumer management of credit, inflation, the impact of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau’s (“CFPB”) late fee rule changes and other statements of our plans, beliefs, or expectations, are forward-\nlooking statements. In some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as “believe,” “can,” “could,”\n“expect,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “seek,” “should,” “think,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions, risks and\nother factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements.\nThese factors include, among others, the risks and others set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nDear Fellow Shareholders:\n“The Aspire card has given me the freedom to buy what I need, when I need it. I am now free to purchase what I need for\nmy family.”\n“Fortiva is great. My car was in the shop and I didn't know how I was going to pay for the repairs... Fortiva came\nthrough…now I can get to work”\n“I like how Aspire has given me a chance to restart my credit history. This was the best decision I have made. Thank you\nAspire!”\n“As a single mom that has faced credit challenges, it makes me feel special to have a credit card, and I am so grateful to\nhave been given that vitally important chance.”\n“This card is a great way to get back on track! Sometimes life happens and illness takes you off track. All is not lost!\nRebuild!”\n“With a quick loan from Curae I was able to pay for an operation to save my life. Thanks Curae!”\n“Fortiva has helped me get my credit to the next level when other companies wouldn't.”\nOur purpose, Empowering Better Financial Outcomes for Everyday Americans, is exemplified in these quotes from just a\nfew of the 3.6 million accounts we serve1. The products we offer on behalf of our bank partners provide an invaluable service\nto consumers. Our focus is on meeting the needs of consumers who are overlooked and underserved by big banks. We offer\naccess to participate in today’s ever growing “cashless” economy. We offer a financial safety net for consumers with limited\nsavings. We offer the dignity of being able to purchase goods and services as customers see fit. We provide the tools to help\nmanage their financial lives. And we do this by following the simplest of rules – we treat our customers the way we would\nwant to be treated.\nBecause of the value we provide consumers, and the way in which we provide those services, the customers we serve give us\na Net Promoter Score of 74. This puts us on par with some of the most respected consumer brands in America – Starbucks\n(77), Google (44), and Netflix (45), and far ahead of mainstream financial institutions which typically score much lower2.\nWhile we take great pride in the role we play with each consumer we serve, we are also mindful of the larger environment in\nwhich we operate and our role within it. It has been widely publicized that credit card debt in the United States (“U.S.”) has\nhit a record high of over $1 trillion3. While the amount of credit card debt does continue to grow, this does not reflect the true\npicture of the consumer. For example, just as credit card debt has grown, so have the U.S. economy, personal incomes and\nbank deposits. As shown in the following graph, as a percentage of both Gross Domestic Product and Disposable Personal\nIncome, credit card debt is just returning to pre-pandemic levels and is well below levels that existed prior to the financial\ncrisis of 2008-20104,5.\n9.00%\n8.00%\n7.00%\n6.00%\n5.00%\n4.00%\n3.00%\n2.00%\nCredit Card Debt: New York Federal Reserve\nGDP: Bureau of Economic Analysis\nDisposable Personal Income: St. Louis Federal Reserve\nThe preference for credit cards as a payment method has also increased over time. The prevalence of rewards, decreasing use\nof cash, and better fraudulent transaction protection have dramatically increased the percent of purchases funded by credit\ncards, a sign of their increased utility and importance in today’s economy. In our business, we have continued to invest in\ntechnology and product innovation that provides greater value to consumers. On average, we engage with customers over 10\ntimes each month as we help them manage their financial lives. Consumers rely on the services we provide more than they\never have.\nWe strive to fairly balance our consumer experience and profitability goals. We provide a valuable service for which\nconsumers have a proven willingness to pay a fair price. In addition to our industry leading net promoter score, when asked,\nconsumers give the services we provide a 4.7 out of 5-star rating and 94% of consumers would refer a friend6. Our goal is\nsimple – treat the customers we serve fairly and produce an adequate return to our shareholders. Earn an excess return and\nwe will lose customers to competitors and not maximize the size of our opportunity. Earn an inadequate return and we will\nnot have the availability of capital that we need to serve the millions of financially fragile Americans we look to help. Over\nour 25+ year history, average profitability per customer has been approximately $1.50 per month. That includes “through the\ncycle” performance covering multiple recessions and inflationary impacts as well as periods of irrational competition. From\nthe consumers’ perspective, the average cost of our general-purpose credit card products equates to less than $1 per day. For\nless than a cup of coffee, the consumers we serve have the ability to purchase online, build credit, and have access to additional\nfunds between paychecks. We believe the quotes at the beginning of this letter demonstrate the value our services provide.\nWe are proud of both the products we offer on behalf of our bank partners and the way in which we offer them. Our data\nindicates that we are having a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans that the Wall Street banks cannot or will\nnot serve. We operate in a heavily regulated industry and hold ourselves to an even higher standard. That is why we have a\nself-imposed rate cap and have accommodating customer service and account management tools to assist customers. And we\nare not done investing in new solutions to further empower better financial outcomes. We have a significant pipeline of\nproduct enhancements that will both improve on our existing offerings and expand the population of consumers we can serve.\nOver 100 million Americans have a credit score of less than 7007, and we currently serve only a small fraction of them. The\nmarket for our services is massive, and we endeavor to create products to meet the many unique needs of Everyday Americans\nand do so in a way in which you, our shareholders, can be proud.\n1Q:30 1Q:40 1Q:50 1Q:60 1Q:70 1Q:80 1Q:90 1Q:01 1Q:11 1Q:21 1Q:31 1Q:41 1Q:51 1Q:61 1Q:71 1Q:81 1Q:91 1Q:02 1Q:12 1Q:22 1Q:32\nCredit Card Debt\nCredit Card Debt/GDP Credit Card Debt/Disposable Personal Income\nBusiness Update\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2022 and continuing throughout 2023, we maintained a more restrictive credit posture as\nconsumers adjusted to continued higher inflation. Our data suggests that the consumers we serve became more stable\nthroughout the year, but at higher than pre-pandemic levels of delinquency. As a result of this higher level of delinquency\nand tightened credit, our growth rate slowed in 2023. As we have said before, our focus is on purchasing receivables that\nachieve an adequate return on our capital, not growth. Despite this more conservative posture, we were able to achieve:\n- increased accounts served on behalf of our bank, brand, and healthcare partners by 9.0%, and now serve 3.6\nmillion Everyday Americans1\n- Purchase volumes of $2.7 billion\n- Managed Receivables8 growth of 13.7% to $2.4 billion\n- Total operating revenue increase of 10.4%\n- Net income attributable to common shareholders and fully diluted earnings per share of $77.6 million and $4.24,\nrespectively\nSome irrational competition persists in our general-purpose credit card segment, limiting opportunities for profitable growth.\nAs we have seen in past cycles, economic downturns and higher interest rates will likely rationalize the market and we look\nforward to accelerating when these market dynamics begin to materialize. We are already seeing this play out in our retail\ncredit line of business. As prime issuers tighten, we are seeing an increase in the application flow from higher FICO\nconsumers and a growing pipeline of merchant opportunities as retail partners look for alternative solutions.\nOur Auto-Finance segment experienced another successful year. Receivables, revenue, and operating profit all increased\nyear-over-year following record years in 2021 and 2022. As we have seen in our retail credit line of business, capital has\ntightened across the auto-finance markets we serve. As a result, more opportunities for this segment of our business are\npresenting themselves.\nLooking Ahead\nInflation continues to be a burden on the consumers we serve. It has, in turn, led to a higher interest rate environment. We are\nalso awaiting the outcome of pending litigation relating to the CFPB’s recent late fee rule changes. We have navigated similar\nchallenges for over 25 years and we will continue to do so, delivering much needed solutions for consumers. We have the\nanalytics, the historical data, and the experience to manage through changes such as these.\nLonger term, we see exceptional opportunity in becoming the primary financial services provider for the middle-class. Our\ndata driven decision making, ongoing investments in technology, growing breadth of product offerings, and extensive\nexperience position us well to expand our capabilities and provide a truly best in class product offering to the consumers we\nserve.\nYou have an extraordinary team focused on delivering for consumers and for you, our shareholders. We are proud of the\nwork that we do and the positive impact it has on the millions of consumers we serve. Many members of the management\nteam are large shareholders of the business, and we are determined to continue to operate the business to produce attractive\nlong-term gains for all of our shareholders. We appreciate your support and wish you all the best in 2024.\nSincerely,\nDavid G. Hanna Jeffrey A. Howard\nExecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors President and Chief Executive Officer\n1.

Each forward-looking\nstatement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. The forward-looking statements we make are not\nguarantees of future performance, and we have based these statements on our assumptions and analyses in light of our\nexperience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we\nbelieve are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and\nuncertainties that could significantly affect expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those\ndescribed in such statements. Management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or\nprojecting any future results based on such statements or present or historical earnings levels.\nAlthough it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties. Among the\nfactors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from our expectations are the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed under \"Risk Factors\" set forth in Part I, Item 1A, and the risk factors and other cautionary statements in other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including the following:\n● general economic and business conditions, including conditions affecting interest rates, tariffs, consumer\nincome, creditworthiness, consumer confidence, spending and savings levels, employment levels, our revenue,\nand our defaults and charge-offs;\n● an increase or decrease in credit losses, or increased delinquencies, including increases due to a worsening of\ngeneral economic conditions in the credit environment;\n● our reliance on proprietary and third-party technology;\n● security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential\ninformation or result in a temporary or permanent shutdown of our services;\n● the availability of adequate financing to support growth;\n● the extent to which federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation of our various business lines and\nthe products we service for others limits or prohibits the operation of our businesses;\n● current and future litigation and regulatory proceedings against us;\n● competition from various sources providing similar financial products, or other alternative sources of credit, to\nconsumers;\n● the adequacy of our allowances for credit losses and estimates of loan losses used within our risk management\nand analyses;\n● the possible impairment of assets;\n● our ability to manage costs in line with the expansion or contraction of our various business lines;\n● our relationship with (i) the merchants that participate in private label credit operations and (ii) the banks that\nissue credit cards and provide certain other credit products utilizing our technology platform and related\nservices;\n● our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants’ increasing\nfocus on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such\nfees;\n● any decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism or other adverse developments with respect to the credit\ncard industry in general;\n● increases or decreases in interest rates and uncertainty with respect to the interest rate environment;\n● theft and employee errors; and\n● impact of recent proposed guidance by the Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nregarding late fees.\nMost of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control. Any of these factors, or a combination of these\nfactors, could materially affect our future financial condition or results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of our\nforward-looking statements.

BUSINESS\nThis Report contains information that we obtained from industry and general publications and research, surveys\nand studies conducted by third parties. This information involves many assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned\nnot to give undue weight to any of this data. We have obtained this information from sources that we believe are\nreliable.

From\ntime to time, we also purchase receivables portfolios from third parties. Subject to the availability of capital at attractive\nterms and pricing, we plan to continue to evaluate and pursue a variety of activities, including: (1) investments in additional\nfinancial assets associated with private label credit and general purpose credit card activities as well as the acquisition of\ninterests in receivables portfolios; (2) investments in other assets or businesses that are not necessarily financial services\nassets or businesses and (3) the repurchase or retirement of debt and equity securities. In this Report, \"receivables\" or\n\"loans\" typically refer to receivables we have purchased from our bank partners or from third parties. The types of revenues\nwe earn from our investments in receivables portfolios and services primarily include fees and finance charges, and\nmerchant fees or annual fees associated with the private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables.\nMarket Overview\nAccording to data published by Experian, 40% of Americans had FICO® scores of less than 700. We believe this\nequates to a population of over 100 million everyday Americans in need of access to credit. These consumers often have\nfinancial needs that are not effectively met by larger financial institutions. By facilitating appropriately priced consumer\ncredit and financial service alternatives with value-added features and benefits curated for the unique needs of these\nconsumers, we endeavor to empower better financial outcomes for everyday Americans.\nCompany History\nWe are a Georgia corporation formed in 2009, as successor to an entity that commenced operations in 1996.\nAtlanticus is a financial technology company powering more inclusive financial solutions for everyday Americans. We\nleverage data, analytics, and innovative technology to unlock access to financial solutions for the millions of Americans\nwho would otherwise be underserved.\nCredit as a Service Segment\nCurrently, within our Credit as a Service (\"CaaS\") segment, we apply our technology solutions, in combination\nwith the experiences gained, and infrastructure built from servicing over $39 billion in consumer loans over more than 25\nyears of operating history, to support lenders in offering more inclusive financial services. These products include private\nlabel credit and general purpose credit cards originated by lenders through multiple channels, including retail and\nhealthcare, direct mail solicitation, digital marketing and partnerships with third parties. The services of our bank partners\nare often extended to consumers who may not have access to financing options with larger financial institutions. Our\nflexible technology solutions allow our bank partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decisioning platform\nwith the existing infrastructure of participating retailers, healthcare providers and other service providers. Using our\ntechnology and proprietary predictive analytics, lenders can make instant credit decisions utilizing hundreds of inputs from\nmultiple sources and thereby offer credit to consumers overlooked by many providers of financing who focus exclusively\non consumers with higher FICO scores. Atlanticus’ underwriting process is enhanced by large language models and\nmachine learning, enabling lenders to make fast, sound decision-making when it matters most.\n1\nUsing our infrastructure and technology, we also provide loan servicing, including risk management and customer\nservice outsourcing, for third parties. Also, through our CaaS segment, we engage in testing and limited investment in\nconsumer finance technology platforms as we seek to capitalize on our expertise and infrastructure. Additionally, we report\nwithin our CaaS segment: 1) servicing income; and 2) gains or losses associated with investments previously made in\nconsumer finance technology platforms. These include investments in companies engaged in mobile technologies,\nmarketplace lending and other financial technologies. None of these companies are publicly-traded and the carrying value of\nour investment in these companies is not material. One of these companies, Fintiv Inc., has sued Apple, Inc., Walmart, Inc.,\nand PayPal Holdings, Inc. for patent infringement. Fintiv Inc. has approximately 150 patents related to secure money\ntransfer on computer and mobile devices. The transaction volume in these areas has increased dramatically over the last five\nyears. If Fintiv Inc. is successful in the patent litigation, there could be large exposure, including treble damages for these\ncompanies. The claimed losses sustained by this patent infringement are substantial and could be measured in the billions of\ndollars. We believe on a diluted basis that we will own over 10% of the company. Apple has vigorously contested the\nclaims, and we expect it to continue doing so. In light of the uncertainty around these lawsuits, we will continue to carry\nthese investments on our books at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges.\nThe recurring cash flows we receive within our CaaS segment principally include those associated with (1) private\nlabel credit and general purpose credit card receivables, (2) servicing compensation and (3) credit card receivables portfolios\nthat are unencumbered or where we own a portion of the underlying structured financing facility. For information regarding\nour concentration with certain retail partners, See Note 11, \"Commitments and Contingencies–Concentrations,\" to our\nconsolidated financial statements included herein.\nOur credit and other operations are heavily regulated, which may cause us to change how we conduct our\noperations either in response to regulation or in keeping with our goal of leading the industry in adherence to consumer-\nfriendly practices. We have made meaningful changes to our practices over the past several years, and because our\naccount management practices are evolutionary and dynamic, it is possible that we may make further changes to these\npractices, some of which may produce positive, and others of which may produce adverse, effects on our operating results\nand financial position. Customers at the lower end of the credit score range intrinsically have higher loss rates than do\ncustomers at the higher end of the credit score range. As a result, the products we support are priced to reflect expected\nloss rates for our various risk categories. See \"Consumer and Debtor Protection Laws and Regulations—CaaS Segment\"\nin Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nSubject to possible disruptions caused by inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain interruptions, we\nbelieve that our private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables are generating, and will continue to\ngenerate, attractive returns on assets, thereby facilitating debt financing under terms and conditions (including advance\nrates and pricing) that will support attractive returns on equity, and we continue to pursue growth in this area.\nAuto Finance Segment\nWithin our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and/or service loans\nsecured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor-plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent\nautomotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. We generate revenues on\npurchased loans through interest earned on the face value of the installment agreements combined with the accretion of\ndiscounts on loans purchased. We generally earn discount income over the life of the applicable loan. Additionally, we\ngenerate revenues from servicing loans on behalf of dealers for a portion of actual collections and by providing back-up\nservicing for similar quality assets owned by unrelated third parties. We offer a number of other products to our network of\nbuy-here, pay-here dealers (including our floor-plan financing offering), but the majority of our activities are represented by\nour purchases of auto loans at discounts and our servicing of auto loans for a fee. As of December 31, 2023, our CAR\noperations served 650 dealers in 32 states and two U.S. territories. The core operations continue to perform well (achieving\nconsistent profitability and generating positive cash flows and growth).\nFair Value Option\nWe account for certain loans receivable associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card\nplatform using fair value accounting. We believe the use of fair value for these receivables more closely approximates the\ntrue economics of these receivables, better matching the yields and corresponding charge-offs. We believe the fair value\noption also enables us to report generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") net income that provides\nincreased transparency into our profitability and asset quality. We estimate the Fair Value Receivables using a discounted\ncash flow model, which considers various factors such as expected yields on consumer receivables, the timing of expected\npayments, customer default rates, estimated costs to service the portfolio, and valuations of comparable portfolios. As a\n2\nresult of this fair value adoption, our loans, interest and fees receivable are carried at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized directly in earnings, and certain fee billings (such as annual membership fees and merchant fees) and origination\ncosts associated with these receivables no longer being deferred. We reevaluate the fair value of our Fair Value Receivables\nat the end of each quarter. As discussed elsewhere in this Report we adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022. This ASU\nrequires the use of an impairment model (the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model) that is based on expected rather\nthan incurred losses. The ASU also allows for a one-time fair value election for receivables. Upon adoption, we elected the\nfair value option for all remaining loans receivable associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit\ncard platform previously recorded at amortized cost and recorded an increase to our Allowances for credit losses for our\nremaining Loans at amortized cost associated with our Auto Finance Segment. See Note 2, \"Significant Accounting\nPolicies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included herein for further discussion of our adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Atlanticus and our Markets\nIn March 2020, a national emergency was declared under the National Emergencies Act due to a new strain of\ncoronavirus. The reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted global supply chains and business operations. In\naddition, rising inflation in 2021 and 2022 resulted in increased costs for many goods and services. As a result of\npersistently high inflation, interest rates have been on the rise. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing regional\nconflict in the Middle East have intensified supply chain disruptions and heightened uncertainty surrounding the near-term\noutlook for the broader economy. The impacts of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by both consumers and\ngovernments, rising energy costs, inflation, rising interest rates, and unresolved geopolitical tensions could significantly\naffect the economic outlook. The duration and severity of the effects of these impacts on our financial condition, results of\noperations and liquidity remain uncertain.\nBorrowers impacted by COVID-19 requesting hardship assistance may have received temporary relief from\npayments or fee waivers. While these measures mitigated credit losses, related economic disruptions subsequently resulted\nin increased portfolio credit losses. The Biden administration ended the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies\non May 11, 2023. The long term impact that the cessation of certain benefits provided under emergency relief programs\nwill have on our consumers is uncertain although the remaining financial statement impact for those customers previously\nprovided the aforementioned short-term payment deferrals and fee waivers is not material.\nThe Company remains committed to serving our bank partners, merchant partners, health care providers and\nconsumers. For more information, refer to Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" and, in particular, \"Other Risks of our Business –\nThe reaction to COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may have a further adverse impacts on\nour performance, results of operations and access to capital\" and \"Other Risks of our Business – Our business and\noperations may be negatively affected by rising prices and interest rates.\"\nReceivables Management and Risk Mitigation\nCaaS Segment. We manage our investments in receivables using credit scoring, credit file data, non-credit-bureau\nattributes, and our proprietary risk evaluation systems developed and refined over more than 25 years of operating history.\nThese strategies include assisting our issuing bank partners with the management of transaction authorizations, account\nrenewals, credit line modifications and collection programs. We use an adaptive control system to translate our strategies\ninto account management processes. The system enables us to develop and test multiple strategies simultaneously, allowing\nus to continually refine account management activities. We have incorporated our proprietary risk scores into this control\nsystem, in addition to standard credit behavior scores used widely in the industry, in order to segment, evaluate and manage\nthe receivables. We believe that by combining external credit file data along with historical and current customer activity,\nwe are able to better predict the true risk associated with current and delinquent receivables.\nFor our private label credit and general purpose credit card finance activities as well as the accounts that are open\nto purchases, we generally assist our issuing bank partners with managing credit lines to reward customers who are\nperforming well and to mitigate losses from delinquent customer segments. We also assist our issuing bank partners with\nemploying strategies to reduce otherwise open credit lines for customers demonstrating indicators of increased credit or\nbankruptcy risk. Data relating to account performance are captured and loaded into our proprietary database for ongoing\nanalysis. Account management strategies are adjusted as necessary, based on the results of such analyses. Additionally, we\nuse industry-standard fraud detection software to manage the portfolio. We route accounts to manual work queues and\nsuspend charging privileges if the transaction-based fraud models indicate a probability of fraudulent use.\n3\nAuto Finance Segment. Our CAR operations manage credit quality and loss mitigation at the dealer portfolio\nlevel through the implementation of dealer-specific loss reserve accounts. In most instances, the reserve accounts are cross-\ncollateralized across all accounts presented by any single dealer. CAR monitors performance at the dealer portfolio level\n(by product type) to adjust pricing, the reserve account, and to determine the size and scope of future account purchases\nfrom such dealer.\nCAR provides dealers with specific purchase guidelines based upon each product offering and delegates approval\nauthority to assist in the monitoring of transactions during the loan acquisition process. Dealers are subject to specific\napproval criteria, and individual accounts typically are verified for accuracy before, during and after the acquisition process.\nDealer portfolios across the business segment are monitored and compared against expected collections and peer dealer\nperformance. Monitoring of dealer pool vintages, delinquencies and loss ratios helps determine past performance and\nexpected future results, which are used to adjust pricing and reserve requirements. Our CAR operations also manage risk\nthrough diversifying their receivables among multiple dealers.\nCollection Strategy\nCaaS Segment. The goal of the collections process is to collect as much of the account balance that is owed in the\nmost customer-friendly and cost-effective manner possible. This collection process has continued to evolve over the course\nof more than 25 years of operating history, with the utilization of digital and mobile processes helping to both facilitate\nbetter communication with the consumer and aid in collections throughout the collection process.\nWe oversee and manage third-party collectors, who employ these digital and mobile processes along with the\ntraditional cross-section of letters, emails and telephone calls to encourage payment. Collectors also sometimes offer\nflexibility with respect to the application of payments in order to encourage larger or prompter payments. For instance, in\ncertain cases collectors may vary the general payment application priority (i.e., of applying payments first to finance\ncharges, then to fees, and then to principal) by agreeing to apply payments first to principal and then to finance charges and\nfees or by agreeing to provide payments or credits of finance charges and principal to induce or in exchange for an\nappropriate payment. Application of payments in this manner also permits collectors to assess real time the degree to which\npayments over the life of an account have covered the principal credit extensions on that account. This allows collectors to\nreadily identify the potential economic loss associated with the charge off of a particular receivable (i.e., the excess of\nprincipal purchases and cash advances funded over payments received throughout the life of the account). The selection of\ncollection techniques, including, for example, the order in which payments are applied or the provision of payments or\ncredits to induce or in exchange for a payment, impacts the statistical performance of the portfolios that we present under\n\"Consolidated Results of Operations—CaaS Segment\" within Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\"\nCollectors employ various and evolving tools when collecting on the receivables, and they routinely test and\nevaluate new tools in their effort toward improving collections with a greater degree of service and efficiency. These tools\ninclude programs under which the contractual interest associated with a receivable may be reduced or eliminated, or a\ncertain amount of accrued fees is waived, provided a minimum number or amount of payments have been made. In some\ninstances, collectors may agree to match the payment on a receivable, for example, with commensurate payments or\nreductions of finance charges or waivers of fees. In other situations, collectors may actually settle and adjust finance\ncharges and fees on a receivable, for example, based on a commitment and follow through on a commitment to pay certain\nportions of the balances owed. Collectors may also decrease minimum payments owed under certain collection programs.\nAdditionally, collectors employ re-aging techniques in compliance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil (\"FFIEC\") guidelines, as discussed below. Moreover, collections are managed in accordance with the\nvoluntary Consumer Credit Counseling Service (\"CCCS\") program by waiving a certain percentage of a receivable under\ncertain circumstances. All of these programs are utilized based on the degree of economic success and customer service\nthey achieve.\nCollectors regularly monitor and adapt collection strategies, techniques, technology and training to optimize\nefforts to reduce delinquencies and charge offs. The output from these collection strategies and techniques is analyzed to\nidentify the strategies and techniques that are most likely to result in curing a delinquent receivable in the most cost-\neffective manner, rather than treating all delinquent receivables the same based on the mere passage of time.\nAs in all aspects of risk management, the results of each of the above strategies is compared with other collection\nstrategies and resources are devoted to those strategies that yield the best results. Results are measured based on, among\nother things, customer satisfaction, delinquency rates, expected losses and costs to collect. Existing strategies are then\nadjusted based on these results. We believe that routinely testing, measuring and adjusting collection strategies results in a\nbetter collection experience, lower bad debt losses and operating expenses.\n4\nInterest and fees for most credit products are discontinued when loans, interest and fees receivable become\ncontractually 90 or more days past due. Loans, interest and fees receivable are charged off when they become contractually\nmore than 180 days past due. For all products, receivables are charged off within 30 days of notification and confirmation\nof bankruptcy or death of the obligor. However, in some cases of death, receivables are not charged off if there is a\nsurviving, contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full.\nThe determination of whether an account is contractually past due is relevant to the delinquency and charge-off\ndata provided under the \"Consolidated Results of Operations—CaaS Segment\" caption within Item 7, \"Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Various factors are relevant in analyzing\nwhether an account is contractually past due (e.g., whether an account has not satisfied its minimum payment due\nrequirement), which is the trigger for moving receivables through various delinquency stages and ultimately to charge-off\nstatus. For private label credit and general purpose credit card accounts, a cardholder's account is considered to be\ndelinquent if the cardholder has not made the required payment as of the payment due date.\nAdditionally, collectors may re-age accounts that meet qualifications for re-aging consistent with FFIEC\nguidelines. Re-aging involves changing the delinquency status of an account. Collectors work cooperatively with customers\ndemonstrating a willingness and ability to repay their indebtedness and who satisfy other criteria but are unable to pay the\nentire past due amount. Generally, to qualify for re-aging, an account must have been opened for at least nine months and\nmay not be re-aged more than once in a twelve-month period or twice in a five-year period. In addition, an account on a\nworkout program may qualify for one additional re-age in a five-year period. The customer also must have made three\nconsecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent cumulative amount in the last three billing cycles. If a re-aged\naccount subsequently experiences payment defaults, it will again become contractually delinquent and will be charged off\naccording to the regular charge-off policy. The practice of re-aging an account may affect delinquencies and charge offs,\npotentially delaying or reducing such delinquencies and charge offs; however, this impact generally changes such\ndelinquencies and charge offs by less than 10% and 5%, respectively.\nWe anticipate that further investments in large language models will enable us to refine our customer-centric\napproach to customer service and collections.\nAs discussed above, typically, once an account is 90 days or more past due, the account is placed on a non-accrual\nstatus. Placement on a non-accrual status results in the use of programs under which the contractual interest associated with\na receivable may be reduced or eliminated, or a certain amount of accrued fees is waived, provided a minimum number or\namount of payments have been made. Following this adjustment, if a customer demonstrates a willingness and ability to\nresume making monthly payments and meets the additional criteria discussed above, collectors will re-age the customer’s\naccount. When an account is re-aged, collectors adjust the status of the account to bring a delinquent account current, but\ngenerally do not make any further modifications to the payment terms or amount owed. Once an account is placed on a\nnon-accrual status, it is closed for further purchases. We believe that re-ages help customers to manage difficult repayment\nperiods, return to good standing and avoid further deterioration to their credit scores.\nAuto Finance Segment. Accounts that CAR purchases from approved dealers initially are collected by the\noriginating branch or service center location using a combination of traditional collection practices. The collection process\nincludes contacting the customer by phone or mail, skip tracing and using starter interrupt devices to minimize\ndelinquencies. Uncollectible accounts in our CAR operation generally are returned to the dealer under an agreement with\nthe dealer to charge the balance on the account against reserve accounts established for each dealer. Autos are generally not\nrepossessed in our CAR operation as a result of the agreements that we have with the dealers unless there are insufficient\ndealer reserves to offset the loss or if a dealer requests repossession.\nConsumer and Debtor Protection Laws and Regulations\nCaaS Segment. Our U.S. business is regulated directly and indirectly under various federal and state consumer\nprotection, collection and other laws, rules and regulations, including the federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility\nand Disclosure Act of 2009 (the \"CARD Act\"), the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(\"Dodd-Frank\"), the federal Truth In Lending Act (\"TILA\"), the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") Act, the\nfederal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. These\nlaws, rules and regulations, among other things, impose disclosure requirements when consumer products are advertised,\nwhen an account is opened, when monthly billing statements are sent and when consumer obligations are collected. In\naddition, various statutes limit the liability of consumers for unauthorized use, prohibit discriminatory practices in\nconsumer transactions, impose limitations on the types of charges that may be assessed and restrict the use of consumer\ncredit reports and other account-related information. Many of our issuing bank partners' products are designed for\n5\ncustomers at the lower end of the credit score range. These products are priced to reflect the higher credit risk of these\ncustomers. Because of the inherently greater credit risks of these customers and the resulting higher interest and fees, we\nand our issuing bank partners may be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. If regulators, including the FDIC (which\nregulates bank lenders), the CFPB and the FTC, object to the terms of these products, or to the marketing or collection\npractices used, we and our issuing bank partners could be required to modify or discontinue certain products or practices.\nAuto Finance Segment. This segment is regulated directly and indirectly under various federal and state consumer\nprotection and other laws, rules and regulations, including the federal TILA, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the\nfederal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Dodd-Frank, the federal Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act and the federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. In addition, various state statutes\nlimit the interest rates and fees that may be charged, limit the types of interest computations (e.g., interest bearing or pre-\ncomputed) and refunding processes, prohibit discriminatory practices in extending credit, impose limitations on fees and\nother ancillary products and restrict the use of consumer credit reports and other account-related information. Many of the\nstates in which this segment operates have various licensing requirements and impose certain financial or other conditions\nin connection with these licensing requirements.\nPrivacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations. We are required to manage, use, and store large amounts of\npersonally identifiable information, principally the confidential personal and financial data of our issuing bank partners’\ncustomers, in the ordinary course of our business. We depend on our IT networks and systems, and those of third parties, to\nprocess, store, and transmit that information. In the past, financial service companies have been targeted for sophisticated\ncyber attacks. A security breach involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential\ninformation. We take numerous measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems as well as customer\ninformation.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect confidential personal and\nfinancial data. For example, we must comply with guidelines under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require each financial\ninstitution to develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing\nsafeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial\ninstitution’s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Additionally, various federal banking\nregulatory agencies, and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data\nsecurity regulations and laws requiring customer notification in the event of a security breach.\nCompetition\nCaaS Segment. We face substantial competition from both financial service and financial technology companies,\nthe intensity of which varies depending upon economic and liquidity cycles. Our financial performance is, in part, a\nfunction of the performance of our investments in receivables and the aggregate outstanding amount of such\nreceivables. The private label credit and general purpose credit card finance activities of our issuing bank partners compete\nwith facilitators and providers of legacy payment and consumer loan methods, such as credit and debit cards, including\nthose provided by card issuing banks; technology solutions, including those provided by financial technology or payment\ncompanies; mobile wallets, such as Apple and PayPal; and pay-over-time solutions providers, including Block and Klarna.\nMany of these competitors are substantially larger than we are, have significantly greater financial resources than we do and\nhave significantly lower costs of funds than we have.\nAuto Finance Segment. Competition within the auto finance sector is widespread and fragmented. Our auto\nfinance operations target automobile dealers that oftentimes are not able to access indirect lending from major financial\ninstitutions or captive finance companies. We compete mainly with a handful of national and regional companies focused\non this credit segment and a large number of smaller, regional private companies with a narrow geographic focus.\nIndividual dealers with access to capital may also compete in this segment through the purchase of receivables from peer\ndealers in their markets.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 386 employees, all of whom are employed within the U.S. We also engage\ntemporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a\nlabor union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good. Our management team members, on\naverage, have over 15 years of tenure with the Company. This experience through macro-economic cycles guides our\ncustomer centric decision making.\n6\nWe believe that our success and future growth depends greatly on our ability to attract, develop and retain top\ntalent. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we seek to provide our employees with opportunities to grow and develop\nin their careers, supported by fair compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.\nTrademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks\nWe have registered and continue to register, when appropriate, various trademarks, trade names and service marks\nused in connection with our businesses. We consider these trademarks, trade names and service marks to be readily\nidentifiable with, and valuable to, our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains trade names and\ntrademarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners.\nCorporate Headquarters and Where to Access Additional Information\nWe are headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and our principal executive offices are located at Five Concourse\nParkway, Suite 300, Atlanta, Georgia 30328. Our headquarters telephone number is (770) 828-2000, and our website is\nwww.Atlanticus.com. We make available free of charge on our website certain of our recent SEC filings, including our\nannual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and\namendments to those filings as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to,\nthe SEC. These reports are also available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.\nCertain corporate governance materials, including our Board of Directors committee charters and our Code of\nBusiness Conduct and Ethics, are posted on our website under the heading \"Investors\" and then \"Corporate Information—\nGovernance Documents.\" From time to time, the corporate governance materials on our website may be updated as\nnecessary to comply with rules issued by the SEC or the NASDAQ Stock Market, or as desirable to further the continued\neffective and efficient governance of our company.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock, preferred stock or other securities involves a number of risks. You should\ncarefully consider each of the risks described below, among others, before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the\nfollowing risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively\naffected, the market prices of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe response to COVID-19 on global commercial activity and the corresponding volatility in financial markets is\nevolving. Initially, the global impact of the outbreak led to many federal, state and local governments instituting\nquarantines and restrictions on travel. More recently, there have been disruptions in global supply chains that have\nadversely impacted a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. In addition, there have\nbeen significant inflation and labor shortages over the past year which could have a continued adverse impact on economic\nand market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown or recession. The rapid development and fluidity\nof this situation preclude any accurate prediction as to the ultimate impact of inflation, rising interest rates and other\nconsequences to the reactions to COVID-19. The global response to COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with\nrespect to our performance and financial results. For additional information, see \"—Other Risks to Our Business—The\nreaction to COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may have a further adverse impacts on our\nperformance, results of operations and access to capital.\"\nOur Cash Flows and Net Income Are Dependent Upon Payments from Our Investments in Receivables\nThe collectability of our investments in receivables is a function of many factors including the criteria used to\nselect who is issued credit, the pricing of the credit products, the lengths of the relationships, general economic conditions,\nthe rate at which consumers repay their accounts or become delinquent, and the rate at which consumers borrow funds.\nDeterioration in these factors would adversely impact our business. In addition, to the extent we have over-estimated\ncollectability, in all likelihood we have over-estimated our financial performance. Some of these concerns are discussed\nmore fully below.\nOur portfolio of receivables is not diversified and primarily originates from consumers whose creditworthiness\nis considered less than prime. Historically, we have invested in receivables in one of two ways—we have either (i)\ninvested in receivables originated by lenders who utilize our services or (ii) invested in or purchased pools of receivables\nfrom other issuers. In either case, substantially all of our receivables are from borrowers represented by credit risks that\nregulators classify as less than prime. Our reliance on these receivables may in the future negatively impact our\nperformance.\n7\nEconomic slowdowns increase our credit losses. During periods of economic slowdown, recession or rapidly\nrising inflation rates, we generally experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit\nlosses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during\nperiods of economic slowdown or recession or rapidly rising inflation rates.\nBecause a significant portion of our reported income is based on management’s estimates of the future\nperformance of receivables, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause\nfluctuations in net income. Significant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management’s estimates of\ncash flows we expect to receive on receivables, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected\ncash flows are based on management’s estimates of credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and yields\nearned on credit card receivables. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our\ncontrol. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause\nfluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net\nincome to be lower than expected. Similarly, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay lenders\nearlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth.\nInternet consumers have unique risk profiles and we may not be able to evaluate their creditworthiness.\nReceivables owned by consumers and acquired over the internet present unique risk characteristics and exhibit higher rates\nof fraud. As a result, we may not be able to successfully evaluate the creditworthiness of these potential consumers.\nTherefore, we may encounter difficulties managing the expected delinquencies and losses.\nWe Are Substantially Dependent Upon Borrowed Funds to Fund Receivables We Purchase\nWe finance receivables that we acquire in large part through financing facilities. All of our financing facilities are\nof finite duration (and ultimately will need to be extended or replaced) and contain financial covenants and other conditions\nthat must be fulfilled in order for funding to be available. The cost and availability of equity and borrowed funds is\ndependent upon our financial performance, the performance of our industry overall and general economic and market\nconditions, and at times equity and borrowed funds have been both expensive and difficult to obtain.\nIf additional financing facilities are not available in the future on terms we consider acceptable, we will not be able\nto purchase additional receivables and those receivables may contract in size.\nCapital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability, potentially limiting our ability to grow our\nreceivables. From time-to-time, capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. For example, from\n2008 to 2009, the global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by the lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets,\nsignificant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and\nthe failure of major financial institutions. These events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that\nmaterially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity\ncapital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. If similar adverse and volatile market conditions\nrepeat in the future, we and other companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative\nmarkets for debt and equity capital in order to grow our receivables.\nMoreover, the re-appearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any\nsubstantial length of time or worsened market conditions could make it difficult for us to borrow money or to extend the\nmaturity of or refinance any indebtedness we may have under similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material\nadverse effect on our business. Unfavorable economic and political conditions, including future recessions, political\ninstability, geopolitical turmoil and foreign hostilities, energy disruptions, inflation, disease, pandemics and other serious\nhealth events, also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders\nnot to extend credit to us.\nThe reaction to COVID-19 adversely impacted global commercial activity and has contributed to significant\nvolatility in financial markets. The pandemic has, in part, caused disruptions in global supply chains that have adversely\nimpacted a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. In addition, there have been\nsignificant inflation and labor shortages over the past two years. The outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on\neconomic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of\nthis situation preclude any accurate prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the coronavirus response. Nevertheless,\nthe pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance and financial results.\n8\nWe may in the future have difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe\ndisruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may cause us to\nreduce the volume of receivables we purchase or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Financial Performance Is, in Part, a Function of the Aggregate Amount of Receivables That Are Outstanding\nThe aggregate amount of outstanding receivables is a function of many factors including purchase rates, payment\nrates, interest rates, seasonality, general economic conditions, competition from credit card issuers and other sources of\nconsumer financing, access to funding, and the timing and extent of our receivable purchases.\nThe recent growth of our investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables may\nnot be indicative of our ability to grow such receivables in the future. Our period-end managed receivables balance for\nprivate label credit and general purpose credit card receivables grew to $2,411.3 million at December 31, 2023, from\n$2,120.1 million at December 31, 2022. The amount of such receivables has fluctuated significantly over the course of our\noperating history. Furthermore, even if such receivables continue to increase, the rate of such growth could decline. If we\ncannot manage the growth in receivables effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,\nresults of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nReliance upon relationships with a few large retailers in the private label credit operations may adversely affect\nour revenues and operating results from these operations. Our five largest retail partners accounted for over 70% of our\noutstanding private label credit receivables as of December 31, 2023. Although we are adding new retail partners on a\nregular basis, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of this operations’ receivables base and\ncorresponding revenue from a relatively small number of partners in the future. If a significant partner reduces or terminates\nits relationship with us, these operations’ revenue could decline significantly and our operating results and financial\ncondition could be harmed.\nWe Operate in a Heavily Regulated Industry\nChanges in bankruptcy, privacy or other consumer protection laws, or to the prevailing interpretation thereof, may\nexpose us to litigation, adversely affect our ability to collect receivables, or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nSimilarly, regulatory changes could adversely affect the ability or willingness of lenders who utilize our technology\nplatform and related services to market credit products and services to consumers. Also, the accounting rules that apply to\nour business are exceedingly complex, difficult to apply and in a state of flux. As a result, how we value our receivables\nand otherwise account for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in, and interpretation of, those\nrules. Some of these issues are discussed more fully below.\nReviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and\nregulations may result in changes to our business practices, may make collection of receivables more difficult or may\nexpose us to the risk of fines, restitution and litigation. Our operations and the operations of the issuing banks through\nwhich the credit products we service are originated are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, state and local government\nauthorities, including the SEC, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FTC, U.K. banking and\nlicensing authorities, state regulators having jurisdiction over financial institutions and debt origination and collection and\nstate attorneys general. Our business practices and the practices of issuing banks, including the terms of products, servicing\nand collection practices, are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities.\nThese reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries. If as part of\nthese reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we or issuing banks are not complying with applicable law, they\ncould request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices,\nchanges in the terms of products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the\npaying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected consumers. They also could require us or\nissuing banks to stop offering some credit products or obtain licenses to do so, either nationally or in select states. To the\nextent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks that originate credit products using our platform, under certain\ncircumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks. We or\nour issuing banks also may elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with law in order to respond to\nregulatory concerns. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation could hurt our ability\nto conduct business with various industry participants or to generate new receivables and could negatively affect our stock\nprice, which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business.\n9\nIf any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator or require us\nor issuing banks to change any practices, the correction of such deficiencies or violations, or the making of such changes,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. In addition, whether or not\nthese practices are modified when a regulatory or enforcement authority requests or requires, there is a risk that we or other\nindustry participants may be named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and\nregulations, including consumer protection laws. Any failure to comply with legal requirements by us or the banks that\noriginate credit products utilizing our platform in connection with the issuance of those products, or by us or our agents as\nthe servicer of our accounts, could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances. The\ninstitution of any litigation of this nature, or any judgment against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of\nthis nature, could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a variety of ways.\nThe regulatory landscape in which we operate is continually changing due to new rules, regulations and\ninterpretations, as well as various legal actions that have been brought against others that have sought to re-characterize\ncertain loans made by federally insured banks as loans made by third parties. If litigation on similar theories were\nbrought against us when we work with a federally insured bank that makes loans and were such an action successful,\nwe could be subject to state usury limits and/or state licensing requirements, loans in such states could be deemed void\nand unenforceable, and we could be subject to substantial penalties in connection with such loans.\nThe case law involving whether an originating lender, on the one hand, or a third party, on the other hand, is the\n\"true lender\" of a loan is still developing and courts have come to different conclusions and applied different analyses. The\ndetermination of whether a third-party service provider is the \"true lender\" is significant because third parties risk having\nthe loans they service becoming subject to a consumer’s state usury limits. A number of federal courts that have opined on\nthe \"true lender\" issue have looked to who is the lender identified on the borrower’s loan documents. A number of state\ncourts and at least one federal district court have considered a number of other factors when analyzing whether the\noriginating lender or a third party is the \"true lender,\" including looking at the economics of the transaction to determine,\namong other things, who has the predominant economic interest in the loan being made. If we were re-characterized as a\n\"true lender\" with respect to the receivables originated by the bank that utilizes our technology platform and other services,\nsuch receivables could be deemed to be void and unenforceable in some states, the right to collect finance charges could be\naffected, and we could be subject to fines and penalties from state and federal regulatory agencies as well as claims by\nborrowers, including class actions by private plaintiffs. Even if we were not required to change our business practices to\ncomply with applicable state laws and regulations or cease doing business in some states, we could be required to register\nor obtain lending licenses or other regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. If the bank that\noriginates loans utilizing our technology platform were subject to such a lawsuit, it may elect to terminate its relationship\nwith us voluntarily or at the direction of its regulators, and if it lost the lawsuit, it could be forced to modify or terminate\nsuch relationship.\nIn addition to true lender challenges, a question regarding the applicability of state usury rates may arise when a\nloan is sold from a bank to a non-bank entity. In Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit held that the federal preemption of state usury laws did not extend to the purchaser of a loan issued by a\nnational bank. In its brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to deny certiorari, the U.S. Solicitor General, joined by the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), noted that the Second Circuit (Connecticut, New York and Vermont) analysis\nwas incorrect. On remand, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York concluded on February 27, 2017,\nthat New York’s state usury law, not Delaware’s state usury law, was applicable and that the plaintiff’s claims under the\nFDCPA and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices could proceed. To that end, the court granted Madden’s motion for\nclass certification. At this time, it is unknown whether Madden will be applied outside of the defaulted debt context in\nwhich it arose. The facts in Madden are not directly applicable to our business, as we do not engage in practices similar to\nthose at issue in Madden. However, to the extent that the holding in Madden is broadened to cover circumstances applicable\nto our business, or if other litigation on related theories were brought against us or others and were successful, or we\notherwise were found to be the \"true lender,\" we could become subject to state usury limits and state licensing laws, in\naddition to the state consumer protection laws to which we are already subject, in a greater number of states, loans in such\nstates could be deemed void and unenforceable, and we could be subject to substantial penalties in connection with such\nloans.\nIn response to the uncertainty Madden created as to the validity of interest rates of bank-originated loans sold in\nthe secondary market, in May 2020 and June 2020, the OCC and the FDIC, respectively, issued final rules that reaffirmed\nthe \"valid when made\" doctrine and clarified that when a bank sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, the interest rates\npermissible prior to the transfer continue to be permissible following the transfer. In the summer of 2020, a number of state\nattorneys general filed suits against the OCC and the FDIC, challenging these \"valid when made\" rules. In February 2022,\nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered two orders granting summary judgement in favor of\nthe OCC and the FDIC. The court held that the bank regulators had the power to issue the rules reaffirming the \"valid when\n10\nmade\" doctrine. Although the practical consequences of Madden have diminished since the initial ruling, uncertainty\nremains in this area of law.\nThe bank that we support in connection with its extension of loans and one of our subsidiaries currently are\ninvolved in a dispute with the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation with respect to the extent to which federal\npreemption preempts state regulation of bank activities related to the lending process, such as lender licensing requirements\nand aspects of those licensing requirements that purport to limit the rate of interest that can be charged. The Commissioner\nissued a \"charge letter\" making various assertions regarding the applicability of the licensing requirements and interest rate\nlimitations, with the case to be heard in the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings where the case is currently\npending. The ultimate remedy sought by the Commissioner is the invalidation of loans to Maryland residents. We believe\nthat preemption should apply and that the licensing requirements should not apply to the bank in its making loans in\nMaryland, but the ultimate outcome could be unfavorable. In light of the amount of loans involved, we do not believe that\nan adverse outcome would be material, but it could result in further erosion of federal preemption and our ability to operate\nas we currently do in Maryland and other states.\nWe support a single bank that markets general purpose credit cards and certain other credit products directly to\nconsumers. We acquire interests in and service the receivables originated by that bank. The bank could determine not to\ncontinue the relationship for various business reasons, or its regulators could limit its ability to issue credit cards utilizing\nour technology platform or to originate some or all of the other products that we service or require the bank to modify those\nproducts significantly and could do either with little or no notice. Any significant interruption or change of our bank\nrelationship would result in our being unable to acquire new receivables or develop certain other credit products. Unless we\nwere able to timely replace our bank relationship, such an interruption would prevent us from acquiring newly-originated\ncredit card receivables and growing our investments in private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables. In\nturn, it would materially adversely impact our business.\nThe FDIC has issued guidance affecting the bank that utilizes our technology platform to market general\npurpose credit cards and certain other credit products and these or subsequent new rules and regulations could have a\nsignificant impact on such credit products. The bank that utilizes our technology platform and other services to market\ngeneral purpose credit cards and certain other credit products is supervised and examined by both the state that charters it\nand the FDIC. If the FDIC or a state supervisory body considers any aspect of the products originated utilizing our\ntechnology platform to be inconsistent with its guidance, the bank may be required to alter or terminate some or all of these\nproducts.\nIn June 2023, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency issued final guidance on managing risks associated with third-party relationships. The guidance sets forth\nconsiderations and a framework with respect to the management of risks arising from third-party relationships and replaces\nthe federal banking agencies' existing guidance on the topic. The guidance broadly applies to business arrangements\nbetween a banking organization and a third party, including relationships with fintech entities and bank/fintech sponsorship\narrangements.\nChanges to consumer protection laws or changes in their interpretation may impede collection efforts or\notherwise adversely impact our business practices. Federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation and\nenforcement of consumer credit card receivables and other loans. Many of these laws (and the related regulations) are\nfocused on non-prime lenders and are intended to prohibit or curtail industry-standard practices as well as non-standard\npractices. For instance, Congress enacted legislation that regulates loans to military personnel through imposing interest rate\nand other limitations and requiring new disclosures, all as regulated by the Department of Defense. Similarly, in 2009\nCongress enacted legislation that required changes to a variety of marketing, billing and collection practices, and the Federal\nReserve adopted significant changes to a number of practices through its issuance of regulations. While our practices are in\ncompliance with these changes, some of the changes (e.g., limitations on the ability to assess up-front fees) have\nsignificantly affected the viability of certain credit products within the U.S. Changes in the consumer protection laws could\nresult in the following:\n● receivables not originated in compliance with law (or revised interpretations) could become unenforceable\nand uncollectible under their terms against the obligors;\n● we may be required to credit or refund previously collected amounts;\n● certain fees and finance charges could be limited, prohibited or restricted, reducing the profitability of\ncertain investments in receivables;\n● certain collection methods could be prohibited, forcing us to revise our practices or adopt more costly or\nless effective practices;\n11\n● limitations on our ability to recover on charged-off receivables regardless of any act or omission on our\npart;\n● some credit products and services could be banned in certain states or at the federal level;\n● federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws could offer additional protections to consumers seeking\nbankruptcy protection, providing a court greater leeway to reduce or discharge amounts owed to us; and\n● a reduction in our ability or willingness to invest in receivables arising under loans to certain consumers,\nsuch as military personnel.\nMaterial regulatory developments may adversely impact our business and results from operations.\nOur Automobile Lending Activities Involve Risks in Addition to Others Described Herein\nAutomobile lending exposes us not only to most of the risks described above but also to additional risks, including\nthe regulatory scheme that governs installment loans and those attendant to relying upon automobiles and their repossession\nand liquidation value as collateral. In addition, our Auto Finance segment operation acquires loans on a wholesale basis\nfrom used car dealers, for which we rely upon the legal compliance and credit determinations by those dealers.\nFunding for automobile lending may become difficult to obtain and expensive. In the event we are unable to\nrenew or replace any Auto Finance segment credit facilities that bear refunding or refinancing risks when they become due,\nour Auto Finance segment could experience significant constraints and diminution in reported asset values as lenders retain\nsignificant cash flows within underlying structured financings or otherwise under security arrangements for repayment of\ntheir loans. If we cannot renew or replace future facilities or otherwise are unduly constrained from a liquidity perspective,\nwe may choose to sell part or all of our auto loan portfolios, possibly at less than favorable prices.\nOur automobile lending business is dependent upon referrals from dealers. Currently we provide substantially\nall of our automobile loans only to or through used car dealers. Providers of automobile financing have traditionally\ncompeted based on the interest rate charged, the quality of credit accepted and the flexibility of loan terms offered. In order\nto be successful, we not only need to be competitive in these areas, but also need to establish and maintain good relations\nwith dealers and provide them with a level of service greater than what they can obtain from our competitors.\nThe financial performance of our automobile loan portfolio is in part dependent upon the liquidation of\nrepossessed automobiles. In the event of certain defaults, we may repossess automobiles and sell repossessed automobiles\nat wholesale auction markets located throughout the U.S. Auction proceeds from these types of sales and other recoveries\ngenerally are not sufficient to cover the outstanding balances of the contracts; where we experience these shortfalls, we will\nexperience credit losses.\nRepossession of automobiles entails the risk of litigation and other claims. Although we have contracted with\nreputable repossession firms to repossess automobiles on defaulted loans, it is not uncommon for consumers to assert that\nwe were not entitled to repossess an automobile or that the repossession was not conducted in accordance with applicable\nlaw. These claims increase the cost of our collection efforts and, if successful, can result in awards against us.\nWe Routinely Explore Various Opportunities to Grow Our Business, to Make Investments and to Purchase and Sell\nAssets\nWe routinely consider acquisitions of, or investments in, portfolios and other assets as well as the sale of portfolios\nand portions of our business. There are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition, including the possibility that we will\novervalue the assets to be purchased and that we will not be able to produce the expected level of profitability from the\nacquired business or assets. Similarly, there are a number of risks attendant to sales, including the possibility that we will\nundervalue the assets to be sold. As a result, the impact of any acquisition or sale on our future performance may not be as\nfavorable as expected and actually may be adverse.\nPortfolio purchases may cause fluctuations in our reported CaaS segment’s managed receivables data, possibly\nreducing the usefulness of this data in evaluating our business. Our reported CaaS segment managed receivables data may\nfluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of recent and future credit card portfolio acquisitions.\nReceivables included in purchased portfolios are likely to have been originated using credit criteria different from\nthe criteria of issuing bank partners that have originated accounts utilizing our technology platform. Receivables included in\nany particular purchased portfolio may have significantly different delinquency rates and charge-off rates than the\nreceivables previously originated and purchased by us. These receivables also may earn different interest rates and fees as\n12\ncompared to other similar receivables in our receivables portfolio. These variables could cause our reported managed\nreceivables data to fluctuate substantially in future periods making the evaluation of our business more difficult.\nAny acquisition or investment that we make will involve risks different from and in addition to the risks to which\nour business is currently exposed. These include the risks that we will not be able to integrate and operate successfully new\nbusinesses, that we will have to incur substantial indebtedness and increase our leverage in order to pay for the acquisitions,\nthat we will be exposed to, and have to comply with, different regulatory regimes and that we will not be able to apply our\ntraditional analytical framework (which is what we expect to be able to do) in a successful and value-enhancing manner.\nOther Risks of Our Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our inability to compete successfully would materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and dynamic industry. We face competition from a variety of players,\nincluding those who enable transactions and commerce via digital payments and consumer loans. Our primary competition\nconsists of facilitators and providers of legacy payment and consumer loan methods, such as credit and debit cards,\nincluding those provided by card issuing banks; technology solutions, including those provided by financial technology or\npayment companies; mobile wallets, such as Apple and PayPal; and pay-over-time solutions providers, including Block and\nKlarna. Consumer lending is a broad and competitive market, and we compete to varying degrees with various platform\nproviders or sources of consumer credit. This can include banks, non-bank lenders, including retail-based lenders, and other\nfinancial technology companies.\nSome of our competitors, particularly credit issuing banks, are substantially larger than we are and have longer\noperating histories than we do, which gives those competitors advantages we do not have, such as more diversified\nproducts, a broader consumer and merchant base, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty, the ability to reach more\nconsumers, the ability to cross sell their products, operational efficiencies, the ability to cross-subsidize their offerings\nthrough their other business lines, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, and\nlower-cost funding. In addition, because many of our competitors are large financial institutions that fund themselves\nthrough low-cost insured deposits and continue to own the loans that they originate, they have certain revenue and funding\nopportunities not available to us. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be better at developing new\nproducts due to their large and experienced data science and engineering teams, who are able to respond more quickly to\nnew technologies.\nAdditionally, merchants are increasingly offering other credit and payment options to customers. We expect\ncompetition to intensify in the future, both as emerging technologies continue to enter the marketplace and as large financial\nincumbents increasingly seek to innovate the services that they offer to compete with us. Technological advances and the\ncontinued growth of e-commerce activities have increased consumers’ accessibility to products and services and led to the\nexpansion of competition in digital payment and consumer loan options such as pay-over-time solutions.\nWe face competition in areas such as compliance capabilities, commercial financing terms and costs of capital,\ninterest rates and fees (and other financing terms) available to consumers from our bank partners, approval rates, model\nefficiency, speed and simplicity of loan origination, ease-of-use, marketing expertise, service levels, products and services,\ntechnological capabilities and integration, borrower experience, brand and reputation. Furthermore, our existing and\npotential competitors may decide to modify their pricing and business models to compete more directly with us. Our ability\nto compete will also be affected by our ability to provide our bank partners with a commensurate or more extensive suite of\nproducts than those offered by our competitors. In addition, current or potential competitors, including financial technology\nlending platforms and existing or potential bank partners, may also acquire or form strategic alliances with one another,\nwhich could result in our competitors being able to offer more competitive loan terms due to their access to lower-cost\ncapital. Such acquisitions or strategic alliances among our competitors or potential competitors could also make our\ncompetitors more adaptable to a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. To stay competitive, we may need to increase our\nregulatory compliance expenditures or our ability to compete may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is driven by constant innovation. We utilize machine learning, which is characterized by extensive\nresearch efforts and rapid technological progress. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological\ndevelopments, our ability to operate profitably could suffer.\n13\nResearch, data accumulation and development by other companies may result in AI models that are superior to our\nAI models or result in products superior to those we develop. Further, technologies, products or services we develop may\nnot be preferred to any existing or newly-developed technologies, products or services. If we are unable to compete with\nsuch companies or fail to meet the need for innovation in our industry, the use of our platform could stagnate or\nsubstantially decline, or our products could fail to maintain or achieve more widespread market acceptance, which would\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects.\nThe reaction to COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may have a further adverse\nimpacts on our performance, results of operations and access to capital. In March 2020, a national emergency was\ndeclared under the National Emergencies Act due to a new strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"). Measures initially taken\nacross the U.S. and worldwide to mitigate the spread of the virus significantly impacted the macroeconomic environment,\nincluding consumer confidence, unemployment and other economic indicators that contribute to consumer spending\nbehavior and demand for credit. More recently, policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have, in part, caused, supply\nchain disruptions, significant inflation, labor shortages and in turn, rising interest rates. Our results of operations are\nimpacted by the relative strength of the overall economy. As general economic conditions improve or deteriorate, the\namount of consumer disposable income tends to fluctuate, which, in turn, impacts consumer spending levels and the\nwillingness of consumers to finance purchases. Furthermore, to the extent that supply chain disruptions result in deferred\npurchases, there will be a corresponding decrease in our receivable purchases.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in us modifying certain business practices, such as transitioning to a\ndistributed work model. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or as we determine to be in the\nbest interests of our employees and consumers.\nFor additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, see additional risk factors included in this\nPart I, Item 1A, as well as Part II, Item 7 \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.\"\nOur business and operations may be negatively affected by rising prices and interest rates. Our financial\nperformance and consumers’ ability to repay indebtedness may be affected by uncertain economic conditions, including\ninflation, government shutdowns and changing interest rates. Higher inflation increases the costs of goods and services,\nreduces consumer spending power and may negatively affect our ability to purchase receivables. In 2022, inflation in\nreached a four-decade high and continues to adversely impact the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to combat inflation. Increased interest rates may adversely impact\nthe spending levels of consumers and their ability and willingness to borrow money. Higher interest rates often lead to\nhigher payment obligations, which may reduce the ability of consumers to remain current on their obligations and,\ntherefore, lead to increased delinquencies, defaults, customer bankruptcies and charge-offs, and decreased recoveries, all\nof which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRecently, prices for energy and food have been particularly volatile in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and\nthe resulting trade restrictions and sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and other countries. These recent events have\nincreased inflationary pressures.\nThe potential for government shutdowns due to Congress' failure to enact an appropriations bill could have a\nnegative impact on the nation's economy and adversely impact both our ability to purchase receivables due to lower\neconomic spending levels and our ability to collect on existing receivables as consumers may have temporary or\npermanent delays in income.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own. As a result, our cash flow and ability to service our\ndebt is dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries. The distribution of subsidiary earnings, or advances or other\ndistributions of funds by subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory and could be subject to contractual\nrestrictions, are contingent upon the subsidiaries’ cash flows and earnings and are subject to various business and debt\ncovenant considerations.\nWe are party to litigation. We are party to certain legal proceedings which include litigation customary for a\nbusiness of our nature. In each case we believe that we have meritorious defenses or that the positions we are asserting\notherwise are correct. However, adverse outcomes are possible in these matters, and we could decide to settle one or more\nof our litigation matters in order to avoid the ongoing cost of litigation or to obtain certainty of outcome. Adverse\noutcomes or settlements of these matters could require us to pay damages, make restitution, change our business practices\nor take other actions at a level, or in a manner, that would adversely impact our business.\n14\nThe failure of financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our current and\nprojected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. During 2023, multiple financial\ninstitutions have been closed and placed in receivership. Although we did not have any funds deposited with the affected\nbanks, we regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. A\nfailure of a depository institution to return deposits could impact access to our invested cash or cash equivalents and could\nadversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\nBecause we outsource account-processing functions that are integral to our business, any disruption or\ntermination of these outsourcing relationships could harm our business. We generally outsource account and payment\nprocessing. If these outsourcing relationships were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were\notherwise disrupted, we would have to obtain these services from alternate providers. There is a risk that we would not be\nable to enter into similar outsourcing arrangements with alternate providers on terms that we consider favorable or in a\ntimely manner without disruption of our business.\nFailure to keep up with the rapid technological changes in financial services and e-commerce could harm our\nbusiness. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new\ntechnology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial and\nlending institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to\naddress the needs of consumers by using technology to support products and services that will satisfy consumer demands\nfor convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement\nnew technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with\ntechnological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete with our competitors. Any\nsuch failure to adapt to changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations,\nfinancial condition or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, our operations could be\ndisrupted and our reputation may be damaged. We rely heavily on networks and information systems and other\ntechnology, that are largely hosted by third parties to support our business processes and activities, including processes\nintegral to the origination and collection of loans and other financial products, and information systems to process financial\ninformation and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting,\nlegal and tax requirements. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business may\nbe impacted by hosted system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by\nfailures during routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious\nor disruptive software, computer hackers, rogue employees or contractors, cyber-attacks by criminal groups, geopolitical\nevents, natural disasters, pandemics, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events.\nIf our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not\neffectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may\nlose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to collect payments in a timely manner. We also could be required to\nspend significant financial and other resources to repair or replace networks and information systems.\nUnauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to\nprotracted and costly litigation, and civil and criminal penalties. To conduct our business, we are required to manage, use,\nand store large amounts of personally identifiable information, consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial\ndata regarding consumers across all operations areas. We also depend on our IT networks and systems, and those of third\nparties, to process, store, and transmit this information. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws\ndesigned to protect this information. Security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential information.\nWe take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and customer\ninformation. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may\nresult in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised. In the past, banks and other financial\nservice providers have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their information technology. An\nincreasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security.\nIf any person, including our employees or those of third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally\nbreaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could\nbe subject to costly litigation, monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Any unauthorized disclosure of\npersonally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws. Further, under credit card rules and\nour contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the\ncredit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card\n15\nindustry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines.\nSecurity breaches also could harm our reputation, which could potentially cause decreased revenues, the loss of existing\nmerchant credit partners, or difficulty in adding new merchant credit partners.\nInternet and data security breaches also could impede our bank partners from originating loans over the\nInternet, cause us to lose consumers or otherwise damage our reputation or business. Consumers generally are concerned\nwith security and privacy, particularly on the Internet. As part of our growth strategy, we have enabled lenders to originate\nloans over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintaining\ncustomer confidence in such products and services offered online.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach\nof the technology used by us to protect our client or consumer application and transaction data transmitted over the Internet.\nIn addition to the potential for litigation and civil penalties described above, security breaches could damage our reputation\nand cause consumers to become unwilling to do business with our clients or us, particularly over the Internet. Any\npublicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions.\nOur ability to service our clients’ needs over the Internet would be severely impeded if consumers become unwilling to\ntransmit confidential information online.\nAlso, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause\ninterruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and\nbusiness.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs. We are subject to various\nregulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For\nexample, we are subject to the Safeguards guidelines under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Safeguards guidelines\nrequire that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security\nprogram containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope\nof the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Broad-ranging data security\nlaws that affect our business also have been adopted by several states.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires,\namong other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers\nwith expanded protections and control over the collection, maintenance, use and sharing of personal information. The\nCCPA continues to be subject to new regulations and legislative amendments. Although we have implemented a\ncompliance program designed to address obligations under the CCPA, it remains unclear what future modifications will be\nmade or how the CCPA will be interpreted in the future. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations and a private\nright of action for data breaches.\nIn addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the\n\"CPRA\") ballot initiative, which became effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA established the California Privacy\nProtection Agency to implement and enforce the CCPA and CPRA. We anticipate that the CPRA and certain regulations\npromulgated by the California Privacy Protection Agency will apply to our business and we will work to ensure compliance\nwith such laws and regulations by their effective dates.\nCompliance with these laws regarding the protection of consumer and employee data could result in higher\ncompliance and technology costs for us, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Further,\nthere are various other statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing, debt collection and text-messaging\nindustries including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is\nevolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and\nall 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data security regulations and laws\nrequiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Also, federal legislators and regulators\nare increasingly pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted, could further restrict how we collect, use,\nshare and secure consumer information, possibly impacting some of our current or planned business initiatives.\n16\nUnplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation. Any interruption in\nthe availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware, operating system failures, or system conversion\nwill reduce our revenues and profits. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly\nsubstantial, reduction in our ability to serve our customers, thereby resulting in a loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent\ninterruptions in our services could cause current or potential consumers to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading\nthem to switch to our competitors or to avoid our websites or services, and could permanently harm our reputation.\nAlthough our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event\nof outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires,\npower loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events or\ndisruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Our systems also are subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any\nprecautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, pandemic, a decision by any of our third-party hosting\nproviders to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at\nour hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in\nour services. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from\ninterruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nClimate change and related regulatory responses may impact our business. Climate change as a result of\nemissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal\nand other regulatory responses. We are uncertain of the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate\nchange and related regulatory responses on our business. The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs,\nadversely impacting consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness.\nWe elected the fair value option for newly originated assets, effective as of January 1, 2020, and for all\nremaining assets associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform as of January 1,\n2022. We use estimates in determining the fair value of our loans. If our estimates prove incorrect, we may be required\nto write down the value of these assets, adversely affecting our results of operations. Our ability to measure and report our\nfinancial position and results of operations is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events on\nthe basis of information available at the time of the issuance of the financial statements. Further, most of these estimates are\ndetermined using Level 3 inputs for which changes could significantly impact our fair value measurements. A variety of\nfactors including, but not limited to, estimated yields on consumer receivables, customer default rates, the timing of\nexpected payments, estimated costs to service the portfolio, interest rates, and valuations of comparable portfolios may\nultimately affect the fair values of our loans and finance receivables. If actual results differ from our judgments and\nassumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Management has processes in\nplace to monitor these judgments and assumptions, but these processes may not ensure that our judgments and assumptions\nare accurate.\nOur allowances for credit losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors and may not be\nadequate to absorb credit losses. We face the risk that customers will fail to repay their loans in full. Through our analysis\nof loan performance, delinquency data, charge-off data, economic trends and the potential effects of those economic trends\non consumers, we establish allowances for credit losses as an estimate of the expected credit losses inherent within those\nloans, interest and fees receivable that we do not report at fair value. We determine the necessary allowances for credit\nlosses by analyzing some or all of the following attributes unique to each type of receivable pool: historical loss rates;\ncurrent delinquency and roll-rate trends; vintage analyses based on the number of months an account has been in existence;\nthe effects of changes in the economy on consumers; changes in underwriting criteria; and estimated recoveries. These\ninputs are considered in conjunction with (and potentially reduced by) any unearned fees and discounts that may be\napplicable for an outstanding loan receivable. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses are due to\nfactors beyond our historical experience or control. As a result, our allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to\nabsorb all credit losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLosses are the largest cost as a percentage of revenues across all of our products. Fraud and customers not being able to\nrepay their loans are both significant drivers of loss rates. If we experienced rising credit or fraud losses this would\nsignificantly reduce our earnings and profit margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,\nresults of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n17\nRisks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities\nThe prices of our securities may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our\nsecurities when you want or at prices you find attractive. The prices of our securities on the NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket constantly change. We expect that the market prices of our securities will continue to fluctuate. The market prices\nof our securities may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors\ninclude the following:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n● changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and\nprojections by Atlanticus, securities analysts and investors;\n● the overall financing environment, which is critical to our value;\n● changes in interest rates;\n● inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n● the operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n● the announcement of enforcement actions or investigations against us or our competitors or other negative\npublicity relating to us or our industry;\n● changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), laws, regulations or the\ninterpretations thereof that affect our various business activities and segments;\n● general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions;\n● changes in ownership by executive officers, directors and parties related to them who control a majority of\nour common stock;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● the annual yield from distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock or interest on the Senior Notes, net, as\ncompared to yields on other financial instruments; and\n● global pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).\nIn addition, the stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be\nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the\ntrading prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market could adversely affect the\ntrading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Sales of significant amounts of\nour common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or the perception that such sales will occur, could\nadversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future\nofferings of equity or equity-related securities. Future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of\ncommon stock for future sale, including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions, may have a material adverse\neffect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are senior obligations, rank\nprior to our common stock with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation and have other terms,\nsuch as a redemption right, that could negatively impact the value of shares of our common stock. In December 2019, we\nissued 400,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The rights of the holders of our Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock with respect to dividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation rank senior to similar obligations to\nour holders of common stock. Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on each\nshare of such stock equal to 6% per annum on the liquidation preference of $100. The dividends on the Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and non-compounding and must be paid before we pay any dividends on the\ncommon stock.\nFurther, on January 1, 2024, the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to require\nus to purchase outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount equal to $100 per share plus any\naccrued but unpaid dividends. This redemption right could expose us to a liquidity risk if we do not have sufficient cash\nresources at hand or are not able to find financing on sufficiently attractive terms to comply with our obligations to\nrepurchase the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon exercise of such redemption right.\nIn June and July 2021, we issued 3,188,533 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of approximately\n$76.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting expenses and the structuring\nfee. Additionally, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock\n18\npursuant our \"at-the-market\" offering program. The rights of the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock with respect to\ndividends, distributions and payments upon liquidation rank junior to similar obligations to our holders of Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock and senior to similar obligations to our holders of common stock. Holders of the Series B\nPreferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on each share of such stock equal to 7.625% per annum on the liquidation\npreference of $25.00 per share. The dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative and non-compounding and\nmust be paid before we pay any dividends on the common stock.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out\nof our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders and before any payment may be made to holders of\nour common stock.\nOur obligations to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock also could\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has anti-dilution protection that, if triggered, could cause\nsubstantial dilution to our then-existing holders of common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price. The\ndocument governing the terms of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution provisions to\nbenefit the holders of such stock. As a result, if we, in the future, issue common stock or other derivative securities, subject\nto specified exceptions, for a per share price less than the then existing conversion price of the Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock, an adjustment to the then current conversion price would occur. This reduction in the conversion price\ncould result in substantial dilution to our then-existing holders of common stock, adversely affecting the price of our\ncommon stock.\nIn the past, we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock on a regular basis, and an increase in the\nmarket price of our common stock, if any, may be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock. With\nthe exception of dividends payable on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, we currently\nplan to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and may not pay any dividends on\nour common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of all future dividends on our common stock, if\nany, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which retains the right to change our dividend policy at any\ntime. Any decision by our board of directors to declare and pay dividends in the future will depend on, among other things,\nour results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions on dividends imposed\nby the documents governing the terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock and other\nfactors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Consequently, appreciation in the market price of our common stock,\nif any, may be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future. Holders of the\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on such stock that are\ncumulative and non-compounding and must be paid before we pay any dividends on the common stock.\nWe have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without\nshareholder approval. Our common stock may be subordinate to additional classes of preferred stock issued in the future in\nthe payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common stock, including distributions upon\nliquidation or dissolution. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \"Articles of Incorporation\") permit our\nboard of directors to issue preferred stock without first obtaining shareholder approval, which we did in December 2019\nwhen we issued the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and in June and July 2021 when we issued the Series B Preferred\nStock. Additionally, the Company has in the past, and may in the future, issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock\npursuant our \"at-the-market\" offering program. If we issue additional classes of preferred stock, these additional securities\nmay have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to the common stock. If we issue additional classes of convertible\npreferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders’ interest. We have similar abilities to\nissue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities.\nOur executive officers, directors and parties related to them, in the aggregate, control a majority of our\ncommon stock and may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval. Our executive officers,\ndirectors and parties related to them own a large enough share of our common stock to have an influence on, if not control\nof, the matters presented to shareholders. As a result, these shareholders may have the ability to control matters requiring\nshareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions,\nsuch as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the\ncontrol of our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or preventing a change of control of us, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination\n19\ninvolving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us,\nadversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock rank junior to our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and all of our\nindebtedness and other liabilities and are effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. In\nthe event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay\nobligations on the Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid and the\nliquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has been satisfied. The rights of holders of the Series B\nPreferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future\ncreditors, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks\nsenior to the Series B Preferred Stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock in one or more series on terms determined by our board of directors, and as of December 31, 2023 we have\noutstanding 400,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 3,256,561 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. As\nof December 31, 2023, we could issue up to 6,343,439 additional shares of preferred stock.\nIn addition, the Series B Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other\nliabilities of (as well as any preferred equity interests held by others in) our existing subsidiaries and any future\nsubsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and any future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal\nobligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series B Preferred Stock. If we are forced to\nliquidate our assets to pay our creditors and holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have\nsufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries\nhave incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the\nSeries B Preferred Stock. We may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged in the future, harming\nour financial position and potentially limiting our cash available to pay dividends. As a result, we may not have sufficient\nfunds remaining to satisfy our dividend obligations relating to our Series B Preferred Stock if we incur additional\nindebtedness or issue additional preferred stock that ranks senior to the Series B Preferred Stock.\nFuture offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the Series B Preferred\nStock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed\nby an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible\nor exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those\nof the Series B Preferred Stock and may result in dilution to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock. We and, indirectly, our\nshareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity\nsecurities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we do not know the\namount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock bear the risk of our future\nofferings reducing the market price of the Series B Preferred Stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us.\nWe may issue additional shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that\nrank on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation or voting rights. We are\nallowed to issue additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank on a\nparity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up\nof our affairs pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Articles of Amendment Establishing\nthe Series B Preferred Stock without any vote of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock. Our Articles of Incorporation\nauthorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms determined by our board of\ndirectors, and as of December 31, 2023 we have outstanding 400,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and\n3,256,561 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2023, we could issue up to 6,343,439 additional shares\nof preferred stock. The issuance of additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock and additional series of parity preferred\nstock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock upon our\nliquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments on the Series B Preferred\nStock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and other classes of\nstock with equal priority with respect to dividends.\nIn addition, although holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to limited voting rights with respect to\nsuch matters, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will vote separately as a class along with all other outstanding\nseries of our preferred stock that we may issue upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. As a\nresult, the voting rights of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may be significantly diluted, and the holders of such\nother series of preferred stock that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any vote.\n20\nFuture issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur,\nmay cause prevailing market prices for the Series B Preferred Stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely\naffect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Such issuances may\nalso reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock have extremely limited voting rights. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock\nhave limited voting rights. Our common stock is the only class of our securities that carries full voting rights. Voting rights\nfor holders of Series B Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect (together with the holders of other\noutstanding series of our preferred stock, or additional series of preferred stock we may issue in the future and upon which\nsimilar voting rights have been or are in the future conferred and are exercisable) two additional directors to our board of\ndirectors in the event that six quarterly dividends (whether or not declared or consecutive) payable on the Series B Preferred\nStock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated\nArticles of Amendment Establishing the Series B Preferred Stock (in some cases voting together with the holders of other\noutstanding series of our preferred stock as a single class) that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of\nSeries B Preferred Stock (and other series of preferred stock, as applicable) or create additional classes or series of our\nstock that are senior to the Series B Preferred Stock, provided that in any event adequate provision for redemption has not\nbeen made. Other than in limited circumstances, holders of Series B Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.\nThe conversion feature of the Series B Preferred Stock may not adequately compensate holders of such stock,\nand the conversion and redemption features of the Series B Preferred Stock may make it more difficult for a party to\ntake over our company and may discourage a party from taking over the Company. Upon the occurrence of a Delisting\nEvent or Change of Control (as defined in the document governing the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock), holders of\nthe Series B Preferred Stock will have the right (unless, prior to the Delisting Event Conversion Date or Change of Control\nConversion Date, as applicable, we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock)\nto convert some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock into our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative\nconsideration), and under these circumstances we will also have a special optional redemption right to redeem the Series B\nPreferred Stock. Upon such a conversion, the holders will be limited to a maximum number of shares of our common stock\nequal to the Share Cap (as defined in the document governing the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock) multiplied by the\nnumber of shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted. If the common stock price is less than $19.275, subject to\nadjustment, the holders will receive a maximum of 1.29702 shares of our common stock per share of Series B Preferred\nStock, which may result in a holder receiving value that is less than the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred\nStock. In addition, those features of the Series B Preferred Stock may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from\nmaking an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the\nCompany under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock\nwith the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price or that shareholders may otherwise believe is\nin their best interests.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be\neligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \"qualified dividend income.\" Distributions paid to corporate U.S.\nholders on the Series B Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-\ncorporate U.S. holders on the Series B Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to\n\"qualified dividend income,\" if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. Although we presently have accumulated earnings and profits, we may not have sufficient current or\naccumulated earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock to qualify\nas dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to any\nfiscal year fail to be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, corporate U.S. holders would be unable to\nuse the dividends-received deduction and non-corporate U.S. holders may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates\napplicable to \"qualified dividend income\" and generally would be required to reduce their tax basis in the Series B\nPreferred Stock by the extent to which the distribution is not treated as a dividend.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the\nconversion rate of the Series B Preferred Stock even though such holders do not receive a corresponding cash dividend.\nThe conversion rate for the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. A failure to adjust (or\nto adjust adequately) the conversion rate after an event that increases the proportionate interest of the Series B Preferred\nStock holders in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to you. If a holder is a non-U.S. holder, any deemed\ndividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an\napplicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Series B Preferred Stock. In April 2016, the\nU.S. Treasury issued proposed income tax regulations in regard to the taxability of changes in conversion rights that will\napply to the Series B Preferred Stock when published in final form and may be applied to us before final publication in\ncertain instances.\n21\nThe indenture governing the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Notes\") and the 9.25% Senior Notes\ndue 2029 (the \"2029 Senior Notes\") does not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we incur any\nadditional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, the holders of that debt will be\nentitled to share ratably with holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection\nwith any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or dissolution. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of\nproceeds paid to holders of Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. Incurrence of additional debt would also further reduce\nthe cash available to invest in operations, as a result of increased debt service obligations. If new debt is added to our\ncurrent debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes, because:\n● it could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the Senior Notes and\n2029 Senior Notes;\n● a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations would have to be dedicated to interest and principal\npayments and may not be available for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general\ncorporate or other purposes;\n● it may impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future;\n● it may limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity;\n● it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n● it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on\nthe Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, we could be in default on the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, and this default\ncould cause us to be in default on other indebtedness, to the extent outstanding. Conversely, a default under any other\nindebtedness, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the related agreement and entitle the\nholders thereof to bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. In addition, such\ndefault or acceleration may result in an event of default and acceleration of other indebtedness, entitling the holders thereof\nto bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. If a judgment is obtained by any\nsuch holders, such holders could seek to collect on such judgment from the assets of Atlanticus. If that should occur, we\nmay not be able to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available,\nit may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nHowever, no event of default under the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes would result from a default or\nacceleration of, or suit, other exercise of remedies or collection proceeding by holders of, our other outstanding debt, if any.\nAs a result, all or substantially all of our assets may be used to satisfy claims of holders of our other outstanding debt, if\nany, without the holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes having any rights to such assets.\nThe Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any\nsecured indebtedness that we currently have or that we may incur in the future. The Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes\nare not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries have currently outstanding or\nmay incur in the future to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the\nSenior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional secured (or\nunsecured) indebtedness in the future. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of\nany of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against\nthe assets pledged to secure that indebtedness and may consequently receive payment from these assets before they may be\nused to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.\nThe Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities\nof our subsidiaries. The Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are obligations exclusively of Atlanticus and not of any of our\nsubsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes and\n2029 Senior Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Therefore,\nin any bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) of our subsidiaries\nwill have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders\nof the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a\ncreditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the\nassets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims.\nConsequently, the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities\n(including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as\n22\nfinancing vehicles or otherwise. The indenture governing the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes does not prohibit us or\nour subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness in the future or granting liens on our assets or the assets of our\nsubsidiaries to secure any such additional indebtedness. In addition, future debt and security agreements entered into by our\nsubsidiaries may contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by\nour subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes contains limited protection for holders of the\nSenior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. The indenture under which the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes were issued\noffers limited protection to holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. The terms of the indenture and the Senior\nNotes and 2029 Senior Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a\nvariety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on the Senior Notes and 2029\nSenior Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes does not place any\nrestrictions on our or our subsidiaries’ ability to:\n● issue debt securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any\nindebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in\nright of payment to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing\nsuch indebtedness or other obligations, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our\nsubsidiaries and which therefore would be structurally senior to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes and\n(4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our\nequity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries;\n● pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities\nsubordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes;\n● sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially\nall of our assets);\n● enter into transactions with affiliates;\n● create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n● make investments; or\n● create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indenture does not include any protection against certain events, such as a change of control, a\nleveraged recapitalization or \"going private\" transaction (which may result in a significant increase of our indebtedness\nlevels), restructuring or similar transactions. Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes does not protect holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes in the event that we experience changes\n(including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not\nrequire that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income,\ncash flow, or liquidity. Also, an event of default or acceleration under our other indebtedness would not necessarily result in\nan \"event of default\" under the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms\nof the indenture may have important consequences for holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, including\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes or\nnegatively affecting the trading value of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.\nOther debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the\nSenior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of\nany such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the Senior Notes and\n2029 Senior Notes.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, and may be forced to take other actions\nto satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments\non, or to refinance our obligations under, our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and that of our\nsubsidiaries, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial and business\nfactors, many of which may be beyond our control.\nWe may not maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,\npremium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt\nservice obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity\ncapital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of\n23\ninterest on, and principal of, our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet\nour scheduled debt service obligations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional\nfinancing. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be\nrequired to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to\nconsummate those sales, or if we do, at an opportune time, the proceeds that we realize may not be adequate to meet debt\nservice obligations when due. Repayment of our indebtedness, to a certain degree, is also dependent on the generation of\ncash flows by our subsidiaries (none of which are guarantors of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes) and their ability to\nmake such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be\npermitted to, make distributions or other payments to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of\nour subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, applicable U.S. and foreign legal and contractual\nrestrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or\nother payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nAn increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the value of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes. In general, as market interest rates rise, notes bearing interest at a fixed rate decline in value. Consequently, if market\ninterest rates increase, the market value of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes may decline.\nWe may issue additional notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes, we may from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior\nNotes, create and issue additional notes which may rank equally with the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. If any such\nadditional notes are not fungible with the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes initially offered hereby for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, such additional notes will have one or more separate CUSIP numbers.\nThe ratings for the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn\nentirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or\nagencies and such ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing\nrating agency. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes. Ratings\ndo not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and the ratings of the Senior Notes and 2029\nSenior Notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business, or the structure or market value of the Senior Notes and\n2029 Senior Notes. We may elect to issue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating in the future. If we issue\nother securities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or\nwithdrawn, could adversely affect the market for or the market value of the Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes.\nNote Regarding Risk Factors\nThe risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material. However, they are not the\nonly ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, also\nmay adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be\nwrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking\nstatements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could\ndecline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required\nby law.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT STRAGEY\nWe have developed and implemented cybersecurity risk management processes intended to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information.\nWhile everyone at our company plays a part in managing cybersecurity risks, primary cybersecurity oversight\nresponsibility is shared by our Board of Directors, the audit committee of the Board of Directors (\"Audit Committee\") and\nsenior management. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management\nprogram.\n24\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n● physical, technological and administrative controls intended to support our cybersecurity and data governance\nframework, including controls designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our key\ninformation systems and customer, employee, bank partner and other third-party information stored on those\nsystems, such as access controls, encryption, data handling requirements and other cybersecurity safeguards,\nand internal policies that govern our cybersecurity risk management and data protection practices;\n● a defined procedure for timely incident detection, containment, response and remediation, including a written\nsecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents;\n● cybersecurity risk assessment processes designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical\nsystems, information, products, services and broader enterprise Information Technology (\"IT\") environment;\n● a security team responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes and security controls;\n● the use of external consultants or other third-party experts and service providers, where considered\nappropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls;\n● annual cybersecurity and privacy training of employees, including incident response personnel and senior\nmanagement, and specialized training for certain teams depending on their role and/or access to certain types\nof information, such as consumer information; and\n● a third-party risk management process that includes internal vetting of certain third-party vendors and service\nproviders with whom we may share data.\nOver the past fiscal year, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of\nany previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including\nour business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. We will continue to monitor and assess our cybersecurity\nrisk management program as well as invest in and seek to improve such systems and processes as appropriate. If we were to\nexperience a material cybersecurity incident in the future, such incident may have a material effect, including on our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For more information regarding cybersecurity risks that we\nface and potential impacts on our business related thereto, refer to Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nCybersecurity Governance\nWith oversight from our Board of Directors, the Audit Committee is primarily responsible for assisting our Board\nof Directors in fulfilling its ultimate oversight responsibilities relating to risk assessment and management, including\nrelating to cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Audit Committee oversees management’s\nimplementation of our cybersecurity risk management program, including processes and policies for determining risk\ntolerance, and reviews management’s strategies for adequately mitigating and managing identified risks, including risks\nrelating to cybersecurity threats.\nThe Audit Committee receives updates from our Chief Information Officer on our cybersecurity risks on a\nperiodic basis or more frequently if needed, and reviews metrics about cyber threat response preparedness, program\nmaturity milestones, risk mitigation status, third party service providers and the current and emerging threat landscape. In\naddition, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity threats or incidents,\nas well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.\nThe Audit Committee reports to our Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related to key\ncybersecurity risks, mitigation strategies and ongoing developments, on a periodic basis or more frequently as needed. The\nBoard of Directors also receives updates from our Chief Information Officer on our cyber risk management program and\nother matters relating to our data privacy and cybersecurity approach, including risk mitigations to bolster and enhance our\ndata protection and data governance framework. Members of our Board of Directors receive presentations that include\ncybersecurity topics and the management of key cybersecurity risks from our Chief Information Officer as part of the\ncontinuing education of our Board of Directors on topics that impact public companies.\nOur management team, including our Chief Information Officer, is responsible for assessing and managing our\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats and for our overall cybersecurity risk management program on a day-to-day basis,\nand supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and the relationship with our retained external cybersecurity\nconsultants. Our Chief Information Officer’s experience includes years of working in the cybersecurity field in various\nindustries, including the financial services industry.\n25\nOur management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and\nincidents through various means, including briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other\ninformation obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts\nand reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe currently lease 73,124 square feet of office space in Atlanta, Georgia for our executive offices and the primary\noperations of our CaaS segment. We have sub-leased 3,100 square feet of this office space. Our Auto Finance segment\nprincipally operates from 2,670 square feet of leased office space in Lake Mary, Florida, with additional offices and branch\nlocations in various states and territories. We believe that our facilities are suitable to our business and that we will be able\nto lease or purchase additional facilities as our needs, if any, require.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. There are\ncurrently no pending legal proceedings that are expected to be material to us.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n26\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER\nMATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"ATLC.\" As of February\n22, 2024, there were 42 record holders of our common stock, which does not include persons whose stock is held in\nnominee or \"street name\" accounts through brokers, banks and intermediaries.\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our repurchases of common stock during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023.\nTotal Maximum\nNumber of Number of\nShares Shares that\nPurchased May Yet\nas Part of Be\nPublicly Purchased\nTotal Announced under the\nNumber of Average Plans or Plans or\nShares Price Paid Programs Programs\nPurchased per Share (1) (2) (3)\nOctober 1 - October 31 ................................................................. 63,764 $ 29.34 63,764 4,166,284\nNovember 1 - November 30 ......................................................... 47,685 $ 30.17 22,089 4,144,195\nDecember 1 - December 31 .......................................................... — $ — — 4,144,195\nTotal ............................................................................................. 111,449 $ 29.70 85,853 4,144,195\n(1) Because withholding tax-related stock repurchases are permitted outside the scope of our 5,000,000 share Board-\nauthorized repurchase plan, these amounts exclude shares of stock returned to us by employees in satisfaction of\nwithholding tax requirements on exercised stock options and vested stock grants. There were 20,434 such shares\nreturned to us during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n(2) Because withholding stock repurchases related to stock option exercise prices are permitted outside the scope of\nour 5,000,000 share Board-authorized repurchase plan, these amounts exclude shares of stock returned to us by\nemployees in satisfaction of stock option exercise prices on exercised grants. There were 5,162 such shares\nreturned to us during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n(3) Pursuant to a share repurchase plan authorized by our Board of Directors on March 15, 2022, we are authorized to\nrepurchase 5,000,000 shares of our common stock through June 30, 2024.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our repurchases of Series B Preferred Stock during the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023.\nMaximum\nTotal Number of\nNumber of Shares that\nShares May Yet\nPurchased Be\nas Part of Purchased\nTotal Publicly under the\nNumber of Average Announced Plans or\nShares Price Paid Plans or Programs\nPurchased per Share Programs (1)\nOctober 1 - October 31 ................................................................. — $ — — 498,194\nNovember 1 - November 30 ......................................................... — $ — — 498,194\nDecember 1 - December 31 .......................................................... — $ — — 498,194\nTotal ............................................................................................. — $ — — 498,194\n(1) On November 8, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of our\nSeries B Preferred Stock through June 30, 2024.\n27\nWe will continue to evaluate our common stock price and Series B Preferred Stock prices relative to other\ninvestment opportunities and, to the extent we believe that the repurchase of our common stock or Series B Preferred Stock\nrepresents an appropriate return of capital, we will repurchase shares of our common stock or Series B Preferred Stock.\nDividends\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. As we continue to pursue our growth\nstrategy, we will assess our cash flow, the long-term capital needs of our business and other uses of cash. Payment of any\ncash dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash\nrequirements and contractual restrictions. Furthermore, dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred\nStock are payable in preference to any common stock dividends. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B\nPreferred Stock, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of $1.90625 per share each year, which is\nequivalent to 7.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share. For additional information, see Part II, Item\n7 \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity, Funding and\nCapital Resources.\"\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes\nincluded therein, where certain terms have been defined.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-\nlooking statements. We base these forward-looking statements on our current plans, expectations and beliefs about future\nevents. There are risks, including the factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report, that our\nactual experience will differ materially from these expectations. For more information, see \"Cautionary Notice Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements\" at the beginning of this Report.\nIn this Report, except as the context suggests otherwise, the words \"Company,\" \"Atlanticus Holdings\nCorporation,\" \"Atlanticus,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" \"ours,\" and \"us\" refer to Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and its subsidiaries and\npredecessors.\nOVERVIEW\nAtlanticus is a financial technology company powering more inclusive financial solutions for everyday Americans.\nWe leverage data, analytics, and innovative technology to unlock access to financial solutions for the millions of Americans\nwho would otherwise be underserved. According to data published by Experian, 40% of Americans had FICO® scores of\nless than 700. We believe this equates to a population of over 100 million everyday Americans in need of access to credit.\nThese consumers often have financial needs that are not effectively met by larger financial institutions. By facilitating\nappropriately priced consumer credit and financial service alternatives with value-added features and benefits curated for\nthe unique needs of these consumers, we endeavor to empower better financial outcomes for everyday Americans.\nCurrently, within our Credit as a Service (\"CaaS\") segment, we apply our technology solutions, in combination\nwith the experiences gained, and infrastructure built from servicing over $39 billion in consumer loans over more than 25\nyears of operating history, to support lenders in offering more inclusive financial services. These products include private\nlabel credit and general purpose credit cards originated by lenders through multiple channels, including retail and\nhealthcare, direct mail solicitation, digital marketing and partnerships with third parties. The services of our bank partners\nare often extended to consumers who may not have access to financing options with larger financial institutions. Our\nflexible technology solutions allow our bank partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decisioning platform\nwith the existing infrastructure of participating retailers, healthcare providers and other service providers. Using our\ntechnology and proprietary predictive analytics, lenders can make instant credit decisions utilizing hundreds of inputs from\nmultiple sources and thereby offer credit to consumers overlooked by many providers of financing who focus exclusively\non consumers with higher FICO scores. Atlanticus’ underwriting process is enhanced by large language models and\nmachine learning, enabling lenders to make fast, sound decisions when it matters most.\n28\nWe are principally engaged in providing products and services to lenders in the U.S. and, in most cases, we invest\nin the receivables originated by lenders who utilize our technology platform and other related services. From time to time,\nwe also purchase receivables portfolios from third parties. In this Report, \"receivables\" or \"loans\" typically refer to\nreceivables we have purchased from our bank partners or from third parties.\nUsing our infrastructure and technology, we also provide loan servicing, including risk management and customer\nservice outsourcing, for third parties. Also, through our CaaS segment, we engage in testing and limited investment in\nconsumer finance technology platforms as we seek to capitalize on our expertise and infrastructure. Additionally, we report\nwithin our CaaS segment: 1) servicing income; and 2) gains or losses associated with investments previously made in\nconsumer finance technology platforms. These include investments in companies engaged in mobile technologies,\nmarketplace lending and other financial technologies. None of these companies are publicly-traded and the carrying value\nof our investment in these companies is not material. One of these companies, Fintiv Inc., has sued Apple, Inc., Walmart,\nInc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc. for patent infringement. Fintiv Inc. has approximately 150 patents related to secure money\ntransfer on computer and mobile devices. The transaction volume in these areas has increased dramatically over the last five\nyears. If Fintiv Inc. is successful in the patent litigation, there could be large exposure, including treble damages for these\ncompanies. The claimed losses sustained by this patent infringement are substantial and could be measured in the billions of\ndollars. We believe on a diluted basis that we will own over 10% of the company. Apple has vigorously contested the\nclaims, and we expect it to continue doing so. In light of the uncertainty around these lawsuits, we will continue to carry\nthese investments on our books at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges.\nThe recurring cash flows we receive within our CaaS segment principally include those associated with (1) private\nlabel credit and general purpose credit card receivables, (2) servicing compensation and (3) credit card receivables\nportfolios that are unencumbered or where we own a portion of the underlying structured financing facility.\nOur credit and other operations are heavily regulated, which may cause us to change how we conduct our\noperations either in response to regulation or in keeping with our goal of leading the industry in adherence to consumer-\nfriendly practices. We have made meaningful changes to our practices over the past several years, and because our account\nmanagement practices are evolutionary and dynamic, it is possible that we may make further changes to these practices,\nsome of which may produce positive, and others of which may produce adverse, effects on our operating results and\nfinancial position. Customers at the lower end of the credit score range intrinsically have higher loss rates than do customers\nat the higher end of the credit score range. As a result, the products we support are priced to reflect expected loss rates for\nour various risk categories. See \"Consumer and Debtor Protection Laws and Regulations—CaaS Segment\" in Item 1 and\nItem 1A, \"Risk Factors\" contained in this Report.\nSubject to possible disruptions caused by inflation, rising interest rates, COVID-19 and supply chain interruptions,\nwe believe that our private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables are generating, and will continue to\ngenerate, attractive returns on assets, thereby facilitating debt financing under terms and conditions (including advance rates\nand pricing) that will support attractive returns on equity, and we continue to pursue growth in this area.\nWithin our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and/or service loans\nsecured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor-plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent\nautomotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. We generate revenues\non purchased loans through interest earned on the face value of the installment agreements combined with the accretion of\ndiscounts on loans purchased. We generally earn discount income over the life of the applicable loan. Additionally, we\ngenerate revenues from servicing loans on behalf of dealers for a portion of actual collections and by providing back-up\nservicing for similar quality assets owned by unrelated third parties. We offer a number of other products to our network of\nbuy-here, pay-here dealers (including our floor-plan financing offering), but the majority of our activities are represented by\nour purchases of auto loans at discounts and our servicing of auto loans for a fee. As of December 31, 2023, our CAR\noperations served 650 dealers in 32 states and two U.S. territories. The core operations continue to perform well (achieving\nconsistent profitability and generating positive cash flows and growth).\nFair Value Election\nWe adopted ASU 2016-13 beginning January 1, 2022. This ASU requires the use of an impairment model that is\nbased on expected rather than incurred losses. The ASU also allows for a one-time fair value election for receivables.\nUpon adoption, we elected the fair value option for all remaining loans receivable associated with our private label credit\nand general purpose credit card platform previously measured at amortized cost and recorded an increase to our\nAllowances for credit losses for our remaining Loans at amortized cost associated with our Auto Finance segment. We\nbelieve the use of fair value for these receivables more closely approximates the true economics of these receivables,\n29\nbetter matching the yields and corresponding charge-offs. We believe the fair value option also enables us to report GAAP\nnet income that provides increased transparency into our profitability and asset quality. See Note 2, \"Significant\nAccounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components-Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" to our\nconsolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of our adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Atlanticus and our Markets\nIn March 2020, a national emergency was declared under the National Emergencies Act due to a new strain of\ncoronavirus. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global supply chains and business\noperations. In addition, rising inflation in 2021 and 2022 resulted in increased costs for many goods and services. As a\nresult of persistently high inflation, interest rates have been on the rise. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the\nongoing regional conflict in the Middle East have intensified supply chain disruptions and heightened uncertainty\nsurrounding the near-term outlook for the broader economy. The impacts of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by both\nconsumers and governments, rising energy costs, inflation, rising interest rates, and unresolved geopolitical tensions could\nsignificantly affect the economic outlook. The duration and severity of the effects of these impacts on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and liquidity remain uncertain.\nBorrowers impacted by COVID-19 requesting hardship assistance may have received temporary relief from\npayments or fee waivers. While these measures mitigated credit losses, related economic disruptions subsequently resulted\nin increased portfolio credit losses. The Biden administration ended the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies\non May 11, 2023. The long term impact that the cessation of certain benefits provided under emergency relief programs\nwill have on our consumers is uncertain although the remaining financial statement impact for those customers previously\nprovided the aforementioned short-term payment deferrals and fee waivers is not material.\nFor more information, refer to Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" and, in particular, \"Other Risks of our Business –\nThe reaction to COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and may have a further adverse impacts on\nour performance, results of operations and access to capital.\" and \"Other Risks of our Business – Our business and\noperations may be negatively affected by rising prices and interest rates.\"\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the Year Ended Increases\nDecember 31, (Decreases)\nfrom 2022 to\n(In Thousands) 2023 2022 2023\nTotal operating revenue ............................................................... $ 1,155,246 $ 1,046,104 $ 109,142\nOther non-operating revenue ....................................................... 630 809 (179)\nInterest expense ...........................................................................

Total operating revenue consists of: 1) interest income, finance charges and late fees on\nconsumer loans, 2) other fees on credit products including annual and merchant fees and 3) ancillary, interchange and\nservicing income on loan portfolios.\nPeriod-over-period results primarily relate to growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card\nproducts, the receivables of which increased to $2,411.3 million as of December 31, 2023 from $2,120.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022. We experienced higher period over period growth in our general purpose credit card acquisitions for\nboth the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2023 than in our acquisition of private label credit receivables.\nThis increase is primarily due to consistent quarterly growth in new customers serviced throughout 2023 compared to\nseasonally driven growth with our private label credit receivables. Growth within our private label credit receivables for\nboth the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2023 was largely due to growth associated with our largest\nexisting retail partners. The relative mix of receivable acquisitions can lead to some variation in our corresponding revenue\nas general purpose credit card receivables typically generate higher gross yields than private label credit receivables do. We\nare currently experiencing continued period-over-period growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card\nreceivables and to a lesser extent in our CAR receivables—growth that we expect to result in net period-over-period growth\nin our total interest income and related fees for these operations for 2024. Future periods’ growth is also dependent on the\naddition of new retail partners to expand the reach of private label credit operations as well as growth within existing\npartnerships and the level of marketing investment for the general purpose credit card operations. Other revenue on our\nconsolidated statements of income consists of ancillary, interchange and servicing income. Ancillary and interchange\nrevenues are largely impacted by growth in our receivables as discussed above. These fees are earned when customers we\nserve use their cards over established card networks. We earn a portion of the interchange fee the card networks charge\nmerchants for the transaction. We earn servicing income by servicing loan portfolios for third parties. Unless and/or until\nwe grow the number of contractual servicing relationships we have with third parties or our current relationships grow their\nloan portfolios, we will not experience significant growth and income within this category. As discussed elsewhere in this\nReport we adopted the fair value option under ASU 2016-13, beginning January 1, 2022, for all remaining loans receivable\nassociated with our private label credit and general purpose credit card platform previously measured at amortized cost.\nThis has resulted in an increase in the recognition of certain fee categories with future changes in the fair value of the\nassociated receivables being included as part of our \"Changes in fair value of loans\" on our consolidated statements of\nincome. The above discussions on expectations for finance, fee and other income are based on our current expectations. See\nNote 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components-Recent Accounting\nPronouncements\" to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of our adoption of ASU\n2016-13.\nOther non-operating revenue. Included within our Other non-operating revenue category is income (or loss)\nassociated with investments in non-core businesses or other items not directly associated with our ongoing operations.\nNone of these companies are publicly-traded and there are no material pending liquidity events. We will continue to carry\nthe investments on our books at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges.\nInterest expense. Variations in interest expense are due to new borrowings associated with growth in private label\ncredit and general purpose credit card receivables and CAR operations as evidenced within Note 10, \"Notes Payable,\" to\nour consolidated financial statements, offset by our debt facilities being repaid commensurate with net liquidations of the\nunderlying credit card, auto finance and installment loan receivables that serve as collateral for the facilities. Outstanding\nnotes payable, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, associated with our private label credit and general\npurpose credit card platform increased to $1,796.0 million as of December 31, 2023 from $1,586.0 million as of December\n31, 2022. The majority of this increase in outstanding debt relates to the addition of multiple revolving credit facilities\nduring 2023. Recent increases in the federal funds rate have started to increase our interest expense as we have raised\nadditional capital (or replaced existing facilities) over the last two years. We anticipate additional debt financing over the\nnext few quarters as we continue to grow coupled with increased effective interest rates resulting from federal funds rate\nincreases. As such, we expect our quarterly interest expense for these operations to increase compared to prior periods.\nHowever, we do not expect our interest expense to increase significantly in the short term (absent raising additional capital)\nbecause over 85% of interest rates on our outstanding debt are fixed. Adding to interest expense in 2024, subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2023, we sold approximately $57.3 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2029.\nProvision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses covers, with respect to such receivables, changes in\nestimates regarding our aggregate loss exposures on (1) principal receivable balances, (2) finance charges and late fees\nreceivable underlying income amounts included within our total interest income category, and (3) other fees receivable.\nRecoveries of charged off receivables, consist of amounts received from the efforts of third-party collectors and through the\n31\nsale of charged-off accounts to unrelated third parties. All proceeds received associated with charged-off accounts, are\ncredited to the allowances for credit losses.\nWe have experienced a period-over-period increase in our provision for credit losses primarily reflecting growth in\nthe underlying receivables subject to this provision as well as slight increases in delinquency rates, similar to those\nexperienced in periods prior to COVID-19 and the related government stimulus programs. See Note 2, \"Significant\nAccounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components,\" to our consolidated financial statements for\nfurther credit quality statistics and analysis. We expect that our provision for credit losses will continue to increase\nmodestly in 2024 in relation to growth in the underlying Auto Finance receivables.\nChanges in fair value of loans. The increase in Changes in fair value of loans was largely driven by growth in the\nunderlying receivables (as noted above). For both periods presented, we included asset performance degradation in our\nforecasts to reflect the possibility of delinquency rates increasing in the near term (and the corresponding increase in\ncharge-offs and decrease in payments) above the level that historical and current trends would suggest. Also impacting this\nincrease in Changes in fair value of loans was a reduction in the discount rate applied to the net cash flows associated with\nthese investments during the second quarter of 2022. The applied discount rate represents estimates third-party market\nparticipants could use in determining fair value. The reduction in this discount rate during the second quarter of\n2022 reflected the asset level returns we believe would be required by market participants based on an asset backed\nsecuritization agreement entered into during that period. See Note 6 \"Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\" included herein\nfor further discussion of assumptions underlying this calculation. For credit card receivables for which we use fair value\naccounting, we expect our change in fair value of credit card receivables recorded at fair value to increase commensurate\nwith growth in these receivables. We may, however, adjust our forecasts to reflect macroeconomic events. Thus, the fair\nvalues are subject to potentially high levels of volatility if we experience changes in the quality of our credit card\nreceivables or if there are significant changes in market valuation factors (e.g., interest rates and spreads) in the future.\nAdditionally, as receivables associated with both 1) assets acquired prior to our tightened underwriting standards adopted\nduring the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters) and 2) those assets negatively impacted by inflation,\ngradually become a smaller percentage of the portfolio, we expect to see overall improvements in the measured fair value\nof our portfolios of acquired receivables.\nTotal operating expenses. Total operating expenses variances for the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, reflect the following:\n● modest increases in salaries and benefit costs related to both the growth in the number of employees and\ninflationary compensation pressure. We expect some continued increase in this cost in 2024 compared to 2023\nas we expect our receivables to continue to grow and as a result we expect to modestly increase our number of\nemployees;\n● increases in card and loan servicing expenses due to growth in receivables associated with our investments in\nprivate label credit and general purpose credit card receivables, which grew to $2,411.3 million outstanding\nfrom $2,120.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As many of\nthe expenses associated with our card and loan servicing efforts are now variable based on the amount of\nunderlying receivables, we would expect this number to continue to grow in 2024 commensurate with growth\nin our receivables. Offsetting a portion of this increase are significant reductions in our servicing costs per\naccount, resulting from the realization of greater economies of scale and increased use of automation as our\nreceivables have grown.\n● decreases in marketing and solicitation costs primarily due to significant decreases in origination and brand\nmarketing support for the year ended December 31, 2023 when compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022. This recent decline in marketing and solicitation costs is a direct result of tightened underwriting\nstandards adopted during the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters). These costs started\nto increase in the third and fourth quarter of 2023, and we expect some increases in period over period results\nfor 2024, although the frequency and timing of increased marketing efforts could vary and are dependent on\nmacroeconomic factors such as national unemployment rates and federal funds rates; and\n● other expenses primarily relate to costs associated with occupancy or other third party expenses that are\nlargely fixed in nature. Some costs including legal expenses and travel expenses are variable based on growth.\nIncluded in 2022 was a one-time $8.5 million accrual related to a settlement of outstanding litigation\nassociated with our Auto Finance segment. While we expect some increase in these costs (excluding the\naccrued litigation costs) as we continue to grow our receivable portfolios, we do not anticipate the increases to\nbe meaningful.\n32\nCertain operating costs are variable based on the levels of accounts and receivables we service (both for our own\nreceivables and for others) and the pace and breadth of our growth in receivables. However, a number of our operating\ncosts are fixed. As we have significantly grown our managed receivables levels over the past two years with minimal\nincrease in the fixed portion of our card and loan servicing expenses as well as our salaries and benefits costs, we have\nrealized greater operating efficiency.\nNotwithstanding our cost management activities, we expect increased levels of expenditures associated with\nanticipated growth in private label credit and general purpose credit card operations. These expenses will primarily relate\nto the variable costs of marketing efforts and card and loan servicing expenses associated with new receivable\nacquisitions. Unknown ongoing potential impacts related to the aforementioned inflation and other global disruptions\ncould result in more variability in these expenses and could impair our ability to acquire new receivables, resulting in\nincreased costs despite our efforts to manage costs effectively.\nNoncontrolling interests. We reflect the ownership interests of noncontrolling holders of equity in our majority-\nowned subsidiaries as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income. In November 2019, a wholly-\nowned subsidiary issued 50.5 million Class B preferred units at a purchase price of $1.00 per unit to an unrelated third\nparty. The units carry a 16% preferred return paid quarterly, with up to 6 percentage points of the preferred return to be\npaid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The units have both call and put rights and are also\nsubject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not satisfied, could allow for the securities to be\nput back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional 50.0 million Class B preferred units under\nthe same terms. A holder of the Class B Preferred Units may, at its election, require the Company to redeem part or all of\nsuch holder’s Class B Preferred Units for cash at $1.00 per unit, on or after October 14, 2024. The proceeds from the\ntransaction were used for general corporate purposes. We have included the issuance of these Class B preferred units as\ntemporary noncontrolling interests on the consolidated balance sheets and the associated dividends are included as a\nreduction of our net income attributable to common shareholders on the consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes. We experienced an effective income tax expense rate of 20.6% and 9.8% for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our effective income tax expense rates for these years are\nbelow the statutory rate principally due to (1) deductions associated with the exercise of stock options and the vesting of\nrestricted stock at times when the fair value of our stock exceeded such share-based awards’ grant date values and (2) our\ndeduction for income tax purposes of amounts characterized in our consolidated financial statements as dividends on a\npreferred stock issuance, such amounts constituting deductible interest expense on a debt issuance for tax\npurposes. Offsetting the above factors are the effects on our effective tax rate of state and foreign income tax expense,\ntaxes on global intangible low-taxed income, and executive compensation deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of\nthe Code. Further details related to the above are reflected in Note 12, \"Income Taxes\".\nWe report income tax-related interest and penalties (including those associated with both our accrued liabilities for\nuncertain tax positions and unpaid tax liabilities) within our income tax line item on our consolidated statements of\nincome. We likewise report the reversal of income tax-related interest and penalties within such line item to the extent we\nresolve our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or unpaid tax liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor. We\nrecognized $0.4 million in potential interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to de minimis interest expense experienced in 2022.\nCaaS Segment\nOur CaaS segment includes our activities related to our servicing of and our investments in the private label credit\nand general purpose credit card operations, our various credit card receivables portfolios, as well as other product testing\nand investments that generally utilize much of the same infrastructure. The types of revenues we earn from our investments\nin receivables portfolios and services primarily include fees and finance charges, merchant fees or annual fees associated\nwith the private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables.\nWe record (i) the finance charges, merchant fees and late fees assessed on our CaaS segment receivables in the\nRevenue - Consumer loans, including past due fees category on our consolidated statements of income, (ii) the annual,\nmonthly maintenance, returned-check, cash advance and other fees in the Revenue - Fees and related income on earning\nassets category on our consolidated statements of income, and (iii) the charge-offs (and recoveries thereof) as a component\nwithin our Changes in fair value of loans on our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, we show the effects of fair\nvalue changes for those credit card receivables for which we have elected the fair value option as a component of Changes\nin fair value of loans in our consolidated statements of income.\n33\nWe historically have invested in receivables portfolios through subsidiary entities. If we control through direct\nownership or exert a controlling interest in the entity, we consolidate it and reflect its operations as noted above. If we exert\nsignificant influence but do not control the entity, we record our share of its net operating results in the equity in income of\nequity-method investee category on our consolidated statements of income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, we present managed receivables, total\nmanaged yield, total managed yield ratio, combined principal net charge-off ratio, percent of managed receivables 30-59\ndays past due, percent of managed receivables 60-89 days past due and percent of managed receivables 90 or more days past\ndue, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures aid in the evaluation of the\nperformance of our credit portfolios, including our risk management, servicing and collection activities and our valuation of\npurchased receivables. The credit performance of our managed receivables provides information concerning the quality of\nloan originations and the related credit risks inherent with the portfolios. Management relies heavily upon financial data and\nresults prepared on the \"managed basis\" in order to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our\nperformance and allocate resources.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. These non-\nGAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\nsubstitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures or the calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures are provided below for each of the fiscal\nperiods indicated.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures include only the performance of those receivables underlying consolidated\nsubsidiaries (for receivables carried at amortized cost basis and fair value) and exclude the performance of receivables held\nby our former equity method investee. As the receivables underlying our former equity method investee reflect a small and\ndiminishing portion of our overall receivables base, we do not believe their inclusion or exclusion in the overall results is\nmaterial. Additionally, we calculate average managed receivables based on the quarter-end balances.\nThe comparison of non-GAAP managed receivables to our GAAP financial statements requires an understanding\nthat managed receivables reflect the face value of loans, interest and fees receivable without any adjustment for potential\ncredit losses to reflect fair value.\nBelow are (i) the reconciliation of Loans at fair value to Loans at amortized cost and (ii) the calculation of managed\nreceivables:\nAt or for the Three Months Ended\n2023 2022\nDec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31\n(in Millions) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\nLoans at fair value ................ $ 2,173.8 $ 2,050.0 $ 1,916.1 $ 1,795.6 $ 1,818.0 $ 1,728.1 $ 1,616.9 $ 1,405.8\nFair value mark against\nreceivable (2) .................... $ 237.5 $ 265.2 $ 257.9 $ 260.1 $ 302.1 $ 322.3 $ 293.0 $ 272.9\nLoans at amortized cost ........ $ 2,411.3 $ 2,315.2 $ 2,174.0 $ 2,055.7 $ 2,120.1 $ 2,050.4 $ 1,909.9 $ 1,678.7\nTotal managed receivables ... $ 2,411.3 $ 2,315.2 $ 2,174.0 $ 2,055.7 $ 2,120.1 $ 2,050.4 $ 1,909.9 $ 1,678.7\nFair value to face value ratio\n(3) ..................................... 90.2% 88.5% 88.1% 87.3% 85.8% 84.3% 84.7% 83.7%\n(1) We elected the fair value option to account for certain loans receivable associated with our private label\ncredit and general purpose credit card platform that were acquired on or after January 1, 2020, and, as\ndiscussed in more detail above in \"—Overview,\" on January 1, 2022, we elected the fair value option under\nASU 2016-13 for those private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables that were previously\naccounted for under the amortized cost method.\n(2) The fair value mark against receivables reflects the difference between the face value of a receivable and the\nnet present value of the expected cash flows associated with that receivable. See Note 6, \"Fair Values of\nAssets and Liabilities\" to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of\nassumptions underlying this calculation.\n(3) The Fair value to face value ratio is calculated using Loans at fair value as the numerator, and Loans at\namortized cost, as the denominator.\n34\nAs discussed above, our managed receivables data differ in certain aspects from our GAAP data. First, managed\nreceivables data are based on billings and actual charge-offs as they occur without regard to any changes in fair value of\nloans or changes in our allowances for credit losses (in periods where applicable). Second, for managed receivables data, we\namortize certain fees (such as annual and merchant fees) and expenses (such as marketing expenses) associated with our\nFair Value Receivables over the expected life of the corresponding receivable and recognize other costs, such as claims\nmade under credit deferral programs, when paid. Under fair value accounting, these fees are recognized when billed or upon\nreceivable acquisition and marketing expenses are recognized when incurred. Third, managed receivables data excludes the\nimpacts of equity in income of equity method investees.

The average age of the accounts underlying our receivables, the timing and size of receivable purchases, the\nsuccess of our collection and recovery efforts and general economic conditions all affect our delinquency and charge-off\nrates. The average age of the accounts underlying our portfolios of receivables also affects the stability of our delinquency\nand loss rates. We consider this delinquency and charge-off data in our allowances for credit losses for our other credit\nproduct receivables that we report at amortized cost. Our strategy for managing delinquency and receivables losses\nconsists of account management throughout the life of the receivable.

Delinquencies have the potential to impact net income in the form of net credit losses.\nDelinquencies also are costly in terms of the personnel and resources dedicated to resolving them. We intend for the\nreceivables management strategies we use on our portfolios to manage and, to the extent possible, reduce the higher\ndelinquency rates that can be expected with the younger average age of the newer receivables in our managed portfolio.\nThese management strategies include conservative credit line management and collection strategies intended to optimize\nthe effective account-to-collector ratio across delinquency categories. We measure the success of these efforts by reviewing\ndelinquency rates. These rates exclude receivables that have been charged off.\nDuring the first and second quarters of 2023 we experienced increased delinquency rates in conjunction with\nslower receivables growth, higher energy costs and rising inflation and the resulting negative impact on consumers. This\nincrease abated in the third and fourth quarters as certain of these costs decreased and consumers adjusted to new price\npoints for these consumer staples while simultaneously enjoying a strong employment environment.\nAs we continue to acquire newer private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables, we expect our\ndelinquency rates to marginally increase in 2024 when compared to the same periods in prior years. This increase will be\nmost prevalent in the first quarter of 2024 (and to a lesser degree in the second quarter of 2024) as the remaining accounts\nthat were enrolled in short-term payment deferrals, due to hardship claims resulting from COVID-19, are expected to\ncharge off. Receivables enrolled in these short-term payment deferrals continued to accrue interest and their delinquency\nstatus did not change through their respective deferment periods. We continue to actively work with consumers that\nindicate hardship as a result of COVID-19; however, the number of impacted consumers is a small part of our overall\nreceivable base. In early 2021, nearly all of these customers were considered current and thus the receivables underlying\ntheir accounts were not considered delinquent. The exclusion of these accounts resulted in lower delinquency rates for those\nperiods than we would have otherwise expected. The remainder of these accounts were removed from hardship status with\nthe end of the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. While these accounts have resulted in\nhigher than normal reported delinquency rates, the expected charge offs will not result in a further economic impact to us as\nthe majority of these accounts were already considered in our changes in fair value.\nFurther impacting expected 2024 delinquency rates, is an ongoing planned shift in our receivables mix to higher\nyielding assets. These assets tend to have higher corresponding delinquencies and chargeoffs and will contribute to\nmarginally higher delinquency rates (and a corresponding higher net interest margin ratio). We also expect continued\nseasonal payment patterns on these receivables that impact our delinquencies in line with prior periods. For example,\ndelinquency rates historically are lower in the first quarter of each year due to the benefits of seasonally strong payment\npatterns associated with tax refunds for many consumers. Offsetting some of this expected increase in delinquencies is\ncontinued growth in the portfolio which will continue to mute some of the aforementioned delinquency increase. Our\nbeliefs for future delinquency rates are predicated on the assumption that the slowing rate of inflation will continue and our\nrecent tightened underwriting standards implemented in the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters),\nwill prove effective at reducing account delinquencies.\nTotal managed yield ratio, annualized. During 2021 and much of 2022, we experienced growth in newer, higher\nyielding receivables, including private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables. While this growth has\ncontributed to higher overall total managed yield ratios, we expect this growth also will continue to result in higher charge-\noff and delinquency rates than those experienced historically. General purpose credit card receivables tend to have higher\ntotal yields than private label credit receivables, so recent declining rates of growth of these receivables have resulted in\nslightly lower total managed yield ratios when compared to similar periods in prior years. With tightened underwriting\nstandards implemented in the second quarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters), we continue to expect slightly\nlower managed yield ratios (and correspondingly lower delinquency rates) associated with these newer receivables for early\n2024 when compared to those ratios in 2022. Subsequent to the first quarter, we expect our total managed yield ratio to\nincrease as the aforementioned receivables mix shift to higher yielding assets becomes a larger component of our acquired\nreceivables.\nCombined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized. We charge off our CaaS segment receivables when they\nbecome contractually more than 180 days past due. For all of our products, we charge off receivables within 30 days of\nnotification and confirmation of a customer’s bankruptcy or death. However, in some cases of death, we do not charge off\nreceivables if there is a surviving, contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full. When the\nprincipal of an outstanding loan is charged off, the related finance charges and fees are simultaneously charged off,\nresulting in a reduction to our Total managed yield.\nGrowth within our general purpose credit card receivables (as a percent of outstanding receivables) has resulted in\nincreases in our charge-offs over time. The increase in the combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized in late 2022\nand throughout 2023 is a reflection of increased delinquencies noted in 2022 as consumer behavior reverted to historical\n39\nnorms (similar to those experienced in periods prior to COVID-19). Additionally, inflation, particularly as it relates to\nhigher gas prices, negatively impacted some consumers' ability to make payments on outstanding loans and fees receivable.\nAs delinquency rates continue to be elevated relative to historically normalized levels (i.e., those periods prior to\nCOVID-19 and the related government stimulus programs), and with our ongoing receivables mix shift into products with\nhigher yields and corresponding charge offs, we expect combined principal net charge-off rates to continue to increase,\nwhen compared to comparable prior periods. These increased charge-off rates are expected to continue through the second\nquarter of 2024 before returning to historically normalized levels. This expectation is predicated on the assumption that the\nslowing rate of inflation will continue. Our charge-off ratio has also been impacted due to (and will continue to be impacted\nby): 1) charge-offs associated with previously mentioned accounts enrolled in short-term payment deferrals (2) higher\nexpected charge-off rates on the private label credit and general purpose credit card receivables corresponding with higher\nyields on these receivables, (3) continued testing of receivables with higher risk profiles, which leads to periodic increases\nin combined principal net charge offs, (4) the aforementioned tightened underwriting standards implemented in the second\nquarter 2022 (and continued in subsequent quarters) that will slow the pace of growth in our receivables base, and (5)\nnegative impacts on some consumers' ability to make payments on outstanding loans and fees receivable as a result of\nCOVID-19 and the related economic impacts. While charge-offs associated with previously mentioned accounts enrolled in\nshort-term payment deferrals will have a negative impact on our Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized\nthrough the second quarter of 2024, they are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of\nincome as the majority of these accounts were already considered in our changes in fair value. Further impacting our\ncharge-off rates are the timing and size of solicitations that serve to minimize charge-off rates in periods of high receivable\nacquisitions but also exacerbate charge-off rates in periods of lower receivable acquisitions.\nInterest expense ratio, annualized. Our interest expense ratio, annualized reflects interest costs associated with\nour CaaS segment. This includes both direct receivables funding costs as well as general unsecured lending. Recent impacts\nto this ratio primarily relate to the timing and size of outstanding debt as well as the addition of new funding facilities. In\ngeneral, we have obtained lower cost financing with fixed interest rates, resulting in lower interest expense ratios. Recent\nincreases in the federal funds borrowing rate have led to an increase in spreads for newly-originated debt and for that\nportion of debt which does not have fixed rates. As such, we have seen our Interest expense ratio, annualized increase\nthroughout 2023 and we expect the interest expense ratio to increase when compared to prior quarters throughout 2024 as\nwe replace existing financing arrangements with new ones.\nNet interest margin ratio, annualized. Our Net interest margin ratio, annualized represents the difference between\nour Total managed yield ratio, annualized, our Combined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized and our Interest expense\nratio, annualized. Recent declines in this ratio when compared to corresponding prior periods relate primarily to recent (and\nprojected) increases in our principal net charge-offs as noted above. Given recent increases in delinquency rates, we expect\nthis ratio to continue to fall for the fourth quarter of 2023 and into early 2024 relative to corresponding periods in 2022 and\n2023 before returning to more historical norms. Changes in the mix shift of acquired receivables noted above will also lead\nto increases in the Net interest margin, annualized as the higher yielding receivables become a larger component of our total\nportfolio.\nAverage APR. The average annual percentage rate (\"APR\") charged to customers varies by receivable type, credit\nhistory and other factors. The APRs for receivables originated through our private label credit platform range from 0% to\n36.0%. For general purpose credit card receivables, APRs typically range from 19.99% to 36.0%. We have experienced\nminor fluctuations in our average APR based on the relative product mix of receivables purchased during a period. For\nthose receivables that did not contain fixed APRs we have seen some increases in rates charged, as the underlying rates are\ntied to the federal funds borrowing rate which increased throughout 2022 and for the first seven months of 2023. We\ncurrently expect our average APRs in 2024 to remain consistent with average APRs over the past several quarters; however,\nthe timing and relative mix of receivables acquired could cause some minor fluctuations. We do not acquire or service\nreceivables that have an APR above 36.0%.\nReceivables purchased during period. Receivables purchased during period reflect the gross amount of\ninvestments we have made in a given period, net of any credits issued to consumers during that same period. For most\nperiods presented, our private label credit receivable purchases experienced overall growth largely based on the addition of\nnew private label credit retail partners as well as growth within existing retail partnerships, as previously discussed. We\nmay experience periodic declines in these acquisitions due to: the loss of one or more retail partners; seasonal purchase\nactivity by consumers; labor shortages and supply chain disruptions; or the timing of new customer originations by our\nissuing bank partners. We currently expect to see increases in receivable acquisitions associated with our retail partnerships\nwhen compared to the same period in prior years, although we expect the pace of acquisitions to slow. Our general purpose\ncredit card receivable acquisitions tend to have more volatility based on the issuance of new credit card accounts by our\n40\nissuing bank partners and the availability of capital to fund new purchases. Nonetheless, we expect continued growth in the\nacquisition of these general purpose credit card receivables during 2024.\nAuto Finance Segment\nCAR, our auto finance platform acquired in April 2005, principally purchases and/or services loans secured by\nautomobiles from or for, and also provides floor-plan financing for, a prequalified network of independent automotive\ndealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. We have expanded these operations\nto also include certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles both in the\nU.S. and U.S. territories.\nCollectively, as of December 31, 2023, we served 650 dealers through our Auto Finance segment in 32 states and\ntwo U.S. territories.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFor reasons set forth above within our CaaS segment discussion, we also provide managed receivables-based\nfinancial, operating and statistical data for our Auto Finance segment. Reconciliation of the auto finance managed\nreceivables data to GAAP data requires an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual\ncharge-offs as they occur, without regard to any changes in our allowances for credit losses. Similar to the managed\ncalculation above, the average managed receivables used in the ratios below is calculated based on the quarter ending\nbalances of consolidated receivables.\nA reconciliation of our operating revenues to comparable amounts used in our calculation of Total managed yield\nratios follows (in millions):\nAt or for the Three Months Ended\n2023 2022\nDec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31\nConsumer loans,\nincluding past due\nfees ............................. $ 10.1 $ 10.1 $ 9.7 $ 9.2 $ 9.0 $ 9.1 $ 8.8 $ 8.3\nFees and related income\non earning assets ........ 0.1 — — — — — — —\nOther revenue ................ 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.3\nTotal operating\nrevenue ....................... 10.4 10.3 9.9 9.4 9.3 9.3 9.0 8.6\nFinance charge-offs ....... — — — — — — — —\nTotal managed yield ...... $ 10.4 $ 10.3 $ 9.9 $ 9.4 $ 9.3 $ 9.3 $ 9.0 $ 8.6\nThe calculation of Combined principal net charge-offs used in our Combined principal net charge-off ratio,\nannualized follows (in millions):\nAt or for the Three Months Ended\n2023 2022\nDec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sep. 30 Jun. 30 Mar. 31\nGross charge-offs .......... $ 1.1 $ 1.0 $ 0.8 $ 1.0 $ 1.2 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.4\nFinance charge-offs (1) . — — — — — — — —\nRecoveries .....................

We expect modest growth in the level of our managed receivables in 2024 when compared\nto the same periods in prior years as CAR expands within its current geographic footprint and continues plans for service\narea expansion. Although we continue to expand our CAR operations, the Auto Finance segment faces strong competition\nfrom other specialty finance lenders, as well as the indirect effects on us of our buy-here, pay-here dealership partners’\ncompetition with other franchise dealerships for consumers interested in purchasing automobiles. We continually evaluate\nbulk purchases of receivables and have experienced good growth in our receivables base throughout 2023 resulting from\nseveral bulk purchases; however, the timing and size of such purchases are difficult to predict.\nDelinquencies. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, early 2022 delinquency rates benefitted from government\nstimulus programs that resulted in customer payments in excess of historical experience. While we have experienced recent\nincreases in our delinquency rates (and related charge-offs), we do not believe they will have a significantly adverse impact\non our results of operations; even at slightly elevated rates, we earn significant yields on CAR’s receivables and have\nsignificant dealer reserves (i.e., retainages or holdbacks on the amount of funding CAR provides to its dealer customers) to\nprotect against meaningful credit losses. Delinquency rates also tend to fluctuate based on seasonal trends and historically\nare lower in the first quarter of each year as seen above due to the benefits of strong payment patterns associated with tax\nrefunds for many consumers.\nTotal managed yield ratio, annualized. We have experienced modest fluctuations in our total managed yield ratio\nlargely impacted by the relative mix of receivables in various products offered by CAR as some shorter-term product\nofferings tend to have higher yields. Yields on our CAR products over the last few quarters are consistent with our\nexpectations over the coming quarters. Further, we expect our total managed yield ratio to remain in line with current\nexperience, with moderate fluctuations based on relative growth or declines in average managed receivables for a given\nquarter. These variations depend on the relative mix of receivables in our various product offerings. Additionally, our\nproduct offerings in the U.S. territories tend to have slightly lower yields than those offered in the U.S. As such, growth in\nthat region also will serve to slightly depress our overall total managed yield ratio, yet we expect growth in that region to\ncontinue to generate attractive returns on assets.\nCombined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized and recovery ratio, annualized. We charge off auto finance\nreceivables when they are between 120 and 180 days past due, unless the collateral is repossessed and sold before that\npoint, in which case we will record a charge off when the proceeds are received. Combined principal net charge-off ratios\nin the above table reflect the lower delinquency rates we have recently experienced. Increases in our Combined principal\nnet charge-off ratios for the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 are indicative of our charge off levels returning to\nhistorically normalized levels (i.e., those periods prior to COVID-19 and the related government stimulus programs). While\nwe anticipate our charge offs to be incurred ratably across our portfolio of dealers, specific dealer-related losses are difficult\nto predict and can negatively influence our combined principal net charge-off ratio. We continually re-assess our dealers\nand will take appropriate action if we believe a particular dealer’s risk characteristics adversely change. While we have\nappropriate dealer reserves to mitigate losses across the majority of our pool of receivables, the timing of recognition of\nthese reserves as an offset to charge offs is largely dependent on various factors specific to each of our dealer partners\nincluding ongoing purchase volumes, outstanding balances of receivables and current performance of outstanding loans. As\nsuch, the timing of charge-off offsets is difficult to predict; however, we believe that these reserves are adequate to offset\nany loss exposure we may incur. Additionally, the products we issue in the U.S. territories do not have dealer reserves with\nwhich we can offset losses. We also expect our recovery rate to fluctuate modestly from quarter to quarter due to the timing\nof the sale of repossessed autos.\nDefinitions of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal managed yield ratio, annualized. Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which includes (as\nappropriate for each applicable disclosed segment) the: 1) finance charge and late fee income billed on all consolidated\noutstanding receivables and the amortization of merchant fees, collectively included in the consumer loans, including past\ndue fees category on our consolidated statements of income; plus 2) credit card fees (including over-limit fees, cash\nadvance fees, returned check fees and interchange income), earned, amortized amounts of annual membership fees with\nrespect to certain credit card receivables, collectively included in our fees and related income on earning assets category\non our consolidated statements of income; plus 3) servicing, other income and other activities collectively included in our\n43\nother operating income category on our consolidated statements of income; minus 4) finance charge and fee losses from\nconsumers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables balances, as well as from bankrupt and deceased consumers. The\ndenominator is our average managed receivables.\nCombined principal net charge-off ratio, annualized. Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which\nis the aggregate consolidated amounts of principal losses from consumers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables\nbalances, as well as from bankrupt and deceased consumers, less current-period recoveries (including recoveries from\ndealer reserve offsets for our CAR operations), as reflected in Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated\nFinancial Statement Components—Loans, Interest and Fees Receivable\", and the denominator of which is average\nmanaged receivables. Recoveries on managed receivables represent all amounts received related to managed receivables\nthat previously have been charged off, including payments received directly from consumers and proceeds received from\nthe sale of those charged-off receivables. Recoveries typically have represented less than 2% of average managed\nreceivables.\nInterest expense ratio, annualized. Represents an annualized fraction, the numerator of which is the annualized\ninterest expense associated with the CaaS segment (See Note 3, \"Segment Reporting\" to our consolidated financial\nstatements) and the denominator of which is average managed receivables.\nNet interest margin ratio, annualized. Represents the Total managed yield ratio, annualized less the Combined\nprincipal net charge-off ratio, annualized less the Interest expense ratio, annualized.\nLIQUIDITY, FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur primary focus is expanding the reach of our financial technology in order to grow our private label credit and\ngeneral purpose credit card receivables and generate revenues from these investments that will allow us to maintain\nconsistent profitability. Increases in new and existing retail partnerships and the expansion of our investments in general\npurpose credit card finance products have resulted in year-over-year growth of total managed receivables levels, and we\nexpect growth to continue in the coming quarters.\nAccordingly, we will continue to focus on (i) obtaining the funding necessary to meet capital needs required by the\ngrowth of our receivables, (ii) adding new retail partners to our platform to continue growth of the private label credit\nreceivables, (iii) growing general purpose credit card receivables, (iv) effectively managing costs, and (v) repurchasing\noutstanding shares of our common and preferred stock. We believe that our actions taken to date, our unrestricted cash,\nfuture cash provided by operating activities, availability under our debt facilities, and access to the capital markets will\nprovide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs.\nAll of our CaaS segment’s structured financing facilities are expected to amortize down with collections on the\nreceivables within their underlying trusts and should not represent significant refunding or refinancing risks to our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Facilities that could represent near-term significant refunding or refinancing needs (within the\nnext 24 months) as of December 31, 2023 are those associated with the following notes payable in the amounts indicated (in\nmillions):\nUnsecured term debt (expiring August 26, 2024) ......................................................................................... $ 17.4\nRevolving credit facility (expiring December 11, 2024) that is secured by certain receivables and\nrestricted cash ............................................................................................................................................ 14.3\nRevolving credit facility (expiring July 20, 2025) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted\ncash ............................................................................................................................................................ 47.5\nRevolving credit facility (expiring October 30, 2025) that is secured by certain receivables and restricted\ncash ............................................................................................................................................................ 38.6\nRevolving credit facility (expiring November 1, 2025) that is secured by certain receivables and\nrestricted cash ............................................................................................................................................ 42.7\nTotal .............................................................................................................................................................. $ 160.5\nBased on the state of the debt capital markets, the performance of our assets that serve as security for the above\nfacilities, and our relationships with lenders, we view imminent refunding or refinancing risks with respect to the above\nfacilities as moderate in the current environment. We believe that the quality of our new receivables should allow us to raise\nmore capital through increasing the size of our facilities with our existing lenders and attracting new lending relationships,\nalbeit at increased costs due to the aforementioned recent increases in the federal funds rate. Further details concerning the\n44\nabove debt facilities and other debt facilities we use to fund the acquisition of receivables are provided in Note 10, \"Notes\nPayable,\" to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nIn November 2021, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (included on our\nconsolidated balance sheet as \"Senior notes, net\"). The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and\nrank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to the Company’s future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The senior\nnotes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the\nvalue of the assets securing such indebtedness, and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future\nindebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries (excluding any amounts owed by\nsuch subsidiaries to the Company). The senior notes bear interest at the rate of 6.125% per annum. Interest on the senior\nnotes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year. The senior notes mature\non November 30, 2026. We repurchased $1.4 million and $0.0 of the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes for\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn June and July 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,188,533 shares of 7.625% Series B Cumulative Perpetual\nPreferred Stock, liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\"), for net proceeds of\napproximately $76.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting expenses and\nthe structuring fee. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, when and as declared by our Board\nof Directors, in the amount of $1.90625 per share each year, which is equivalent to 7.625% of the $25.00 liquidation\npreference per share.\nOn August 10, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \"Preferred Stock Sales\nAgreement\") providing for the sale by the Company of up to an aggregate offering price of $100.0 million of our (i) Series B\nPreferred Stock and (ii) senior notes, from time to time through a sales agent, in connection with the Company's \"at-the-\nmarket\" offering program (the \"Preferred Stock ATM Program\"). Further, on December 29, 2023, the Company entered into\nan At-The-Market Sales Agreement (the \"Common Stock Sales Agreement\") providing for the sale by the Company of its\ncommon stock, no par value per share (the \"Common Stock\"), up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million, from time\nto time to or through a sales agent, in connection with the Company’s Common Stock \"at-the-market\" offering program (the\n\"Common Stock ATM Program\"). Sales pursuant to both the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement and Common Stock Sales\nAgreement, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket. The sales agents will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and\nsales practices up to the amount specified in, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the placement notices.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we sold 53,727 shares and 19,607 shares, respectively, of our\nSeries B Preferred Stock under the Preferred Stock ATM Program. We received $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively,\nin net proceeds from sales under the Preferred Stock ATM Program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no shares\nwere sold under our Common Stock ATM Program.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased and contemporaneously retired 1,806 shares\nand 3,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate cost of $29,000 and $69,000, respectively.\nOn November 14, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary issued 50.5 million Class B preferred units at a purchase price\nof $1.00 per unit to an unrelated third party. The units carry a 16% preferred return paid quarterly, with up to 6 percentage\npoints of the preferred return to be paid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The units have both\ncall and put rights and are also subject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not satisfied, could\nallow for the securities to be put back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional 50.0 million\nClass B preferred units under the same terms. A holder of the Class B Preferred Units may, at its election, require the\nCompany to redeem part or all of such holder’s Class B Preferred Units for cash at $1.00 per unit, on or after October 14,\n2024. The proceeds from the transaction were used for general corporate purposes. We have included the issuance of these\nClass B preferred units as temporary noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Class\nB preferred units are deducted from Net income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to\ncommon shareholders. See Note 5, \"Redeemable Preferred Stock\" and Note 13, \"Net Income Attributable to Controlling\nInterests Per Common Share\" to our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nOn November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove\nVentures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (\"Dove\"). The agreement provided for a senior secured term loan\nfacility in an amount of up to $40.0 million at any time outstanding. On December 27, 2019, the Company issued 400,000\nshares of its Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $40.0 million, in exchange for full\n45\nsatisfaction of the $40.0 million that the Company owed Dove under the Loan and Security Agreement. Dividends on the\npreferred stock are 6% per annum (cumulative, non-compounding) and are payable as declared, and in preference to any\ncommon stock dividends, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The Company may,\nat its option, redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on or after January 1, 2025 at a redemption price equal to $100\nper share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. At the request of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Series\nA Preferred Stock, the Company is required to offer to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price\nequal to $100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, at the option of the holders thereof, on or after January\n1, 2024. Upon the election by the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, each share of the Series A\nPreferred Stock is convertible into the number of shares of the Company’s common stock as is determined by dividing (i)\nthe sum of (a) $100 and (b) any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such share by (ii) an initial conversion price equal to\n$10 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances to prevent dilution.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $339.3 million in unrestricted cash held by our various business subsidiaries.\nBecause the characteristics of our assets and liabilities change, liquidity management is a dynamic process for us, driven by\nthe pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities. We historically have financed our business through cash flows from\noperations, asset-backed structured financings and the issuance of debt and equity. Details concerning our cash flows for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n● During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $459.3 million of cash flows from operations\ncompared to our generation of $347.6 million of cash flows from operations during the year ended December\n31, 2022. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally related to an increase in\nfinance and fee collections associated with growing private label credit and general purpose credit card\nreceivables as well as decreased year-over-year payments made to pay federal and state taxes. Collections on\nreceivables have generally benefited from increased consumer payments as a result of government stimulus\npayments. As the impact of these stimulus payments has largely diminished, consumer payments have\nreturned to historical levels.\n● During the year ended December 31, 2023, we used $672.2 million of cash from our investing activities,\ncompared to use of $682.3 million of cash from investing activities during the year ended December 31,\n2022. This slight decrease in cash used is primarily due to decreases in the level of net investments primarily\nin general purpose credit card receivables relative to the same period in 2022 resulting from tightened\nunderwriting standards as well as marginal increases in recoveries on charged-off receivables.\n● During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $163.3 million of cash from financing activities,\ncompared to our generating $261.3 million of cash from financing activities during the year ended December\n31, 2022. In both periods, the data reflect borrowings associated with private label credit and general purpose\ncredit card receivables (discussed further in Note 10, \"Notes Payable\") offset by net repayments of amortizing\ndebt facilities as payments are made on the underlying receivables that serve as collateral. Additionally\noffsetting the decline in cash provided from financing activities between 2023 and 2022, we purchased and\nretired $89.0 million of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022 pursuant to both open\nmarket and private purchases and the return of stock by holders of equity incentive awards to pay tax\nwithholding obligations compared to $17.7 million of such purchases during the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nBeyond our immediate financing efforts discussed throughout this Report, we will continue to evaluate debt and\nequity issuances as a means to fund our investment opportunities. We expect to take advantage of any opportunities to\nraise additional capital if terms and pricing are attractive to us. Any proceeds raised under these efforts or additional\nliquidity available to us could be used to fund (1) additional investments in private label credit and general purpose credit\ncard finance receivables as well as the acquisition of credit card receivables portfolios and (2) further repurchases or\nredemptions of preferred and common stock. Pursuant to share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, we\nare authorized to repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock and 500,000 shares of our Series B Preferred\nStock through June 30, 2024.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe do not currently have any off-balance-sheet arrangements; however, we do have certain contractual\narrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur; we refer to these\narrangements as contingent commitments. We do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any\nmaterial amounts being paid by us. See Note 11, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to our consolidated financial\nstatements included herein for further discussion of these matters.\n46\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components,\" to our\nconsolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe have prepared our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are numerous and\ncomplex. We have summarized our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In\nmany instances, the application of GAAP requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to\nparticular facts and circumstances. A variance in the estimates used or a variance in the application or interpretation of\nGAAP could yield a materially different accounting result. It is impracticable for us to summarize every accounting\nprinciple that requires us to use judgment or estimates in our application. Nevertheless, we describe below the areas for\nwhich we believe that the estimations, judgments or interpretations that we have made, if different, would have yielded the\nmost significant differences in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our significant accounting policies and the related assumptions, in particular,\nthose mentioned below, with the audit committee of the Board of Directors.\nMeasurements for Loans at Fair Value\nOur valuation of loans at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows using a valuation model of\nexpected cash flows and the estimated cost to service and collect those cash flows. Our valuation model uses inputs that\nare not observable but reflect our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value.\nWe estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally-developed\nestimates of assumptions third-party market participants would use in determining fair value, including estimates of gross\nyield billed by our bank partner, purchase and payment rates by consumers, expected credit loss rates due to nonpayment\non the receivables, expected servicing costs to collect cash flows, and discount rates which approximate required returns\nby a purchaser of expected cash flows. All of these assumptions are primarily based on historical performance. These\nvaluation models are calculated by combining similarly priced loans and vintages to determine a stream of expected cash\nflows which are then discounted. The individual discounted pools of cash flows are then aggregated to determine the total\nexpected discounted cash flows on the outstanding receivable at a given measurement period.\nThe estimates for the above mentioned assumptions significantly affect the reported amount (and changes thereon)\nof our loans at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. For a summary of how\ncertain key inputs (derived from the above assumptions) to our valuation model have changed since December 31, 2022,\nrefer to Note 6 \"Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\" in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nincluded in this report. For more information regarding the potential impact that changes in these key inputs might have on\nour Income before income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, refer to Item 7A., \"Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" included elsewhere in this report.\nAllowances for credit losses\nThrough our analysis of loan performance, delinquency data, charge-off data, economic trends and the potential\neffects of those economic trends on consumers, we establish allowances for credit losses as an estimate of the expected\ncredit losses inherent with those loans, interest and fees receivable that we do not report at fair value. Our loans at\namortized cost consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans in our Auto Finance segment. These loans are further\ndivided into pools based on common characteristics such as contract or acquisition channel. For each pool, we determine\nthe necessary allowances for credit losses using reasonable and supportable forecasts that analyze some or all of the\nfollowing attributes unique to each type of receivable pool: historical loss rates on similar loans; current delinquency and\nroll-rate trends which may indicate consumer loss rates in excess or less than those which historical trends might suggest;\nvintage analyses based on the number of months an account has been in existence; the effects of changes in the economy\non consumers such as inflation or other macroeconomic changes; changes in underwriting criteria; unfunded commitments\n(to the extent they are unconditional), and estimated recoveries. The aforementioned inputs are calculated using historical\ntrends over the most recent five year period, and adjusted as needed for current trends and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. These inputs are considered in conjunction with (and potentially reduced by) any unearned fees and discounts\nthat may be applicable for an outstanding loan receivable. To the extent that actual results differ from our estimates of\ncredit losses on loans at amortized cost, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially affected.\n47\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various risks, particularly related to our private label credit\nand general purpose credit cards as well as our Auto Finance segment. These risks primarily relate to interest rate risk,\ncredit risk, market return risk, payment risk and counterparty risk, each of which is described below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk reflects the risk that, as interest rates rise on secured debt, we are unable to reprice the underlying\nassets that serve as collateral for that debt. Certain of our financing facilities are priced at spreads over floating interest rates\n(such as SOFR or the Prime Rate) and, as such, increases in those rates could have a negative impact on our results of\noperations. We mitigate this risk by minimizing the amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations with the significant\nmajority of our debt facilities bearing fixed interest rates. To the extent interest rates on our non-fixed interest rate facilities\nincrease, our margin (between a floating cost of funds and a fixed rate interest income stream on the underlying collateral)\nmay become compressed to the extent we are unable to reprice those assets.\nAll of our Auto Finance segment’s loans receivable are fixed rate amortizing loans and typically are not eligible to\nbe repriced. As such, we incur interest rate risks within our Auto Finance segment because funding under our structured\nfinancing facilities is priced at a spread over a floating rate benchmark. In a rising rate environment, our net interest margin\nbetween a floating cost of funds and a fixed rate interest income stream may become compressed. We believe we are able to\neffectively mitigate this risk due to the short term nature of many of our receivables and the ability to adjust pricing on new\nreceivable purchases.\nThe following table summarizes the potential effect on pre-tax earnings over the next 12 months from interest\nexpense, assuming we are unable to reprice the underlying assets that serve as collateral, on that portion of notes payable\nsubject to interest rate volatility. The sensitivity analysis performed by management assumes an immediate hypothetical\nincrease and decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points (dollars in millions). Actual results could differ materially\nfrom these estimates:\nImpact on Pre-Tax earnings if\nInterest Rates:\nAs of\nDecember 31, Increase 100 Decrease 100\n2023 Basis Points Basis Points\nNotes payable subject to interest rate risk .......................................... $ 208.1 $ (2.1) $ 2.1\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of default that results from a consumer who is unwilling or unable to pay his or her\nreceivable balance. Most receivables associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit cards serve as\ncollateral on debt for which creditors do not have recourse against the general assets of the Company. As such, for these\nassets, our credit risk is limited to repurchase obligations due to fraud or origination defects. For those assets that do not\nserve as collateral for debt or for which creditors on collateralized debt have recourse against the general assets of the\nCompany, we are subject to credit risk to the extent we are not able to fully recover the principal balance of the receivable.\nWe minimize this risk through a robust underwriting and fraud detection process designed to minimize losses and comply\nwith applicable laws and our standards. In addition, we believe this risk is mitigated by our deep experience in customer\nservice and collections from more than 25 years of operations.\n48\nThe following table summarizes (in millions) the potential effect on pre-tax earnings and the potential effect on the\nfair values of loans on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, based on a sensitivity analysis performed by\nmanagement assuming an immediate hypothetical change in credit loss rates by 10% for the next 12 months. The sensitivity\ndoes not factor in other associative impacts that could occur in such a scenario. This could include both active and passive\naccount actions including limiting purchases, assessments of additional fees or increases in interest rates. The fair value and\nearnings sensitivities are applied only to financial assets that existed at the balance sheet date, which included our loans,\ninterest and fees receivable, at fair value and our loans, interest and fees receivable, gross. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates:\nImpact if Credit Loss Rates:\nAs of\nDecember 31, Increase 10 Decrease 10\n2023 Percent Percent\nLoans at fair value .............................................................................. $ 2,173.8 $ 2,084.1 $ 2,263.4\nLoans at amortized cost, net ............................................................... $ 98.4 $ 98.2 $ 98.6\nIncome (loss) before income taxes ..................................................... $ (89.9) $ 89.8\nMarket Return Risk\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss that may result from changes in required market rates of return. We are exposed\nto such market return risk directly through our loans, interest and fees receivable, at fair value which are measured on a\nrecurring basis. Loans, interest and fees receivable, at fair value rely upon unobservable inputs. These are measured at fair\nvalue using a discounted cash flow methodology in which the discount rate represents estimates third-party market\nparticipants could use in determining fair value. The discount rates for our Loans, interest and fees receivable, at fair value\nmay change due to changes in expected loan performance or changes in the expected returns of similar financial instruments\navailable in the market.\nThe following table summarizes (in millions) the potential effect on pre-tax earnings and the potential effect on the\nfair values of loans on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, based on a sensitivity analysis performed by\nmanagement assuming an immediate hypothetical change in required market rates of return by 10%. The fair value and\nearnings sensitivities are applied only to financial assets that existed at the balance sheet date, which included all of our\nloans, interest and fees receivable, at fair value and our loans, interest and fees receivable, gross. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates:\nImpact if Discount Rates:\nAs of\nDecember 31, Increase 10 Decrease 10\n2023 Percent Percent\nLoans at fair value .............................................................................. $ 2,173.8 $ 2,132.6 $ 2,216.3\nIncome (loss) before income taxes ..................................................... $ (41.2) $ 42.5\nPayment Risk\nPayment risk reflects the risk that changes in the economy could result in reduced payment rates on our\nreceivables. In a strong economy, consumers' incomes may increase which may lead to increased payment rates. In a weak\neconomy, consumers' incomes may decrease which may lead to decreased payment rates. Likewise, the availability of\ngovernment stimulus payments to consumers during a weak economy may cause payment rates to increase. Similar to our\ncredit risk, we believe this risk is mitigated by our deep experience in customer service and collections from over 25 years\nof operations. We may also take active and passive account actions including limiting purchases, assessments of additional\nfees or increases in interest rates if results indicate a possible exposure.\n49\nThe following table summarizes (in millions) the potential effect on pre-tax earnings and the potential effect on the\nfair values of loans on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, based on a sensitivity analysis performed by\nmanagement assuming an immediate hypothetical change in payment rates by 10% for the next 12 months.

We seek to mitigate this risk by ensuring that we have sufficient borrowing capacity with a\nvariety of well-established counterparties to meet our funding needs. As of December 31, 2023, we had total borrowings\nassociated with our loans at fair value and our loans at amortized cost of $1.9 billion.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSee the Index to Financial Statements in Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\"\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2023, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rule 13a-15(e) under the Act) was carried out on behalf of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation and our subsidiaries by our\nmanagement and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (principal financial officer). Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) for Atlanticus Holdings\nCorporation and our subsidiaries. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework (2013 framework).\nBased on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, management has concluded that internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been\naudited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying attestation\nreport, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023. BDO's report is on page F-1 of the attached financial statements.\n50\nRemediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\nAs previously reported, the Company’s management determined that they did not maintain effective controls and\nretain sufficient documentary evidence to support the precision of review over the development of cash flow forecasts used\nin the calculation of the fair value estimate of loans at fair value. This deficiency represented a material weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company’s management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the\nmaterial weakness identified above, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the material weakness described above and designed a remediation plan to enhance the Company’s internal\ncontrol environment. To remediate the material weakness, the Company’s management enhanced the design of certain\nreview controls to include sufficient precision of management’s review as well as retain incremental evidence that supports\nthe effectiveness of controls related to the development and review of cash flow forecasts used in the calculation of the fair\nvalue estimate of loans at fair value. These enhanced controls were implemented as of June 30, 2023, and have been tested\nand determined to be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the\nmaterial weakness identified above has been effectively remediated as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Controls\nThe Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect\nthat the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting will\nprevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple\nerror or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or\nmore people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in\nachieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations\nin a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)\nof the Act) adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such\nterms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).\nITEM 9C.

In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\nthe COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, shareholders’ equity and temporary equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 4, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A,\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 4, 2024\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nAtlanticus Holdings Corporation\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation (the \"Company\") as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and temporary equity and\ncash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial\nstatements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nyears then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (\"COSO\") and our report dated March 4, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\nDiscount rate utilized in estimating the fair value of Loans at Fair Value\nAs described in Note 6 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company has outstanding loans at fair\nvalue of $2,174 million at December 31, 2023. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, all loans\nassociated with the Company’s private label credit and general-purpose credit cards are included within loans at fair value.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the loans using a discounted cash flow model, which considers various\nunobservable inputs such as credit losses, purchase rates, payment rates, servicing costs, contractual servicing fees, costs of\nfunds, discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables. The Company re-evaluates the fair value of loans at the\nclose of each measurement period. The impact of changes in the fair value of loans at fair value is reflected within the\nperiod incurred and can have a material impact on the financial results of the Company.\nWe identified the discount rates as the significant assumptions used by the Company to estimate the fair value of\noutstanding loans at fair value to be a critical audit matter. The discount rates used to discount projected cash flows that\nthird-party market participants would use are based upon unobservable inputs and are considered highly subjective as there\nis no active market for these loans. Auditing the discount rates involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the\nnature of audit evidence and nature and extent of audit effort required including the involvement of individuals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Testing the relevance and reliability of data related to the discount rates by agreeing data to internal and external third-\nparty sources.\n● Involving professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation to assist in the evaluation of the\nreasonableness of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value by comparing to market-based\ndiscount rates to determine if such assumptions were relevant, reliable, and reasonable for the purpose used, including\nconsideration of evidence (e.g., external economic data, peer data, internal company data) that may be contradictory to\nthe conclusion reached by management.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 4, 2024\nF-3\nAtlanticus Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents (including $158.0 million and $202.2 million\nassociated with variable interest entities at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively) ....................................................................................................... $ 339,338 $ 384,984\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (including $20.5 million and $27.6 million\nassociated with variable interest entities at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively) ....................................................................................................... 44,315 48,208\nLoans, interest and fees receivable:\nLoans at fair value (including $2,128.6 million and $1,735.9 million\nassociated with variable interest entities at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively) .............................................................. 2,173,759 1,817,976\nLoans at amortized cost ................................................................................. 118,045 105,267\nAllowances for credit losses ..........................................................................

Description of Our Business\nOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atlanticus Holdings Corporation (the\n\"Company\") and those entities we control. We are a purpose driven financial technology company. We are primarily\nfocused on facilitating consumer credit through the use of our financial technology and related services. Through our\nsubsidiaries, we provide technology and other support services to lenders who offer an array of financial products and\nservices to consumers who may have been declined by other providers of credit.\nWe are principally engaged in providing products and services to lenders in the U.S. and, in most cases, we invest\nin the receivables originated by lenders who utilize our technology platform and other related services. From time to time,\nwe also purchase receivables portfolios from third parties. In these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\n\"receivables\" or \"loans\" typically refer to receivables we have purchased from our bank partners or from third parties.\nWithin our Credit as a Service (\"CaaS\") segment, we apply our technology solutions, in combination with the\nexperiences gained, and infrastructure built from servicing over $39 billion in consumer loans over more than 25 years of\noperating history, to support lenders in offering more inclusive financial services. These products include private label\ncredit and general purpose credit cards originated by lenders through multiple channels, including retailers and healthcare\nproviders, direct mail solicitation, digital marketing and partnerships with third parties. The services of our bank partners\nare often extended to consumers who may not have access to financing options with larger financial institutions. Our\nflexible technology solutions allow our bank partners to integrate our paperless process and instant decisioning platform\nwith the existing infrastructure of participating retailers, healthcare providers and other service providers. Using our\ntechnology and proprietary predictive analytics, lenders can make instant credit decisions utilizing hundreds of inputs from\nmultiple sources and thereby offer credit to consumers overlooked by many providers of financing who focus exclusively\non consumers with higher FICO scores. Atlanticus’ underwriting process is enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning, enabling fast, sound decision-making when it matters most.\nWe also report within our CaaS segment: 1) servicing income; and 2) gains or losses associated with investments\npreviously made in consumer finance technology platforms. These include investments in companies engaged in mobile\ntechnologies, marketplace lending and other financial technologies. None of these companies are publicly-traded and the\ncarrying values of our investments in these companies are not material.\nWithin our Auto Finance segment, our CAR subsidiary operations principally purchase and/or service loans\nsecured by automobiles from or for, and also provide floor plan financing for, a pre-qualified network of independent\nautomotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here, used car business. We purchase auto loans\nat a discount and with dealer retentions or holdbacks that provide risk protection. Also within our Auto Finance segment,\nwe are providing certain installment lending products in addition to our traditional loans secured by automobiles.\nAs a result of the declaration of a national emergency and the associated government policy responses to COVID-\n19 and corresponding inflation, certain consumers were previously offered the ability to defer their payment without\npenalty during the national emergency period. In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an \"Interagency\nStatement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the\nCoronavirus\" (\"COVID-19 Guidance\"). The COVID-19 Guidance encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with\nborrowers that were unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. In accordance with\nthe COVID-19 Guidance, certain consumers negatively impacted by COVID-19 were provided short-term payment\ndeferrals and fee waivers. Receivables enrolled in these short-term payment deferrals continued to accrue interest and their\ndelinquency status was not changed through the deferment period. The Biden administration ended the COVID-19 national\nand public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. This action ended the flexibility provided under the COVID-19 Guidance.\nThe long-term impact that the cessation of certain benefits provided under emergency relief programs will have on our\nconsumers is uncertain although the remaining financial statement impact for those customers previously provided the\naforementioned short-term payment deferrals and fee waivers is not material.\nF-8\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Consolidated Financial Statement Components\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial\nstatements, as well as a description of significant components of our consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of\nthe date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each\nreporting period. We base these estimates on information available to us as of the date of the financial statements. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates. Certain estimates, such as credit losses, payment rates, servicing\ncosts, discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables, significantly affect the reported amount (and changes\nthereon) of our Loans at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income.\nWe have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions for financial reporting purposes.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The\nCompany’s policy is to consolidate the financial statements of entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The\nCompany determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity or variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and if the accounting guidance requires consolidation. For more\ninformation on the Company's VIEs, see Note 8 \"Variable Interest Entities\".\nUnrestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market investments and overnight deposits. We\nconsider all highly liquid cash investments with low interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less to be\ncash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. We maintain unrestricted cash and\ncash equivalents for general operating purposes. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in accounts at regulated\ndomestic financial institutions in amounts that exceed FDIC insured amounts. All cash balances are maintained at well\ncapitalized institutions.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes certain collections on loans, interest and fees receivable, the cash balances of which are\nrequired to be distributed to noteholders under our debt facilities. Our restricted cash balances also include minimum cash\nbalances held in accounts at the request of certain of our business partners.\nLoans, Interest and Fees Receivable\nWe maintain two categories of Loans on our consolidated balance sheets: those that are carried at fair value (Loans\nat fair value) and those that are carried at net amortized cost (Loans at amortized cost). For our Loans at fair value (within\nour CaaS segment), interest and fees are discontinued when the receivable becomes contractually 90 or more days past due.\nFor our Loans at amortized cost (within our Auto Finance segment), we continue interest and fee billings until the time of\nchargeoff if there is adequate value associated with the underlying asset serving as collateral for the receivable. Once a loan\ndiscontinues accruing interest and fees it is ineligible to return to accrual status. We charge off receivables underlying our\nLoans at fair value, against our Changes in fair value of loans, when they become contractually more than 180 days past\ndue, or 120 days past due if they are enrolled in an installment loan product. We charge off our Loans at amortized\ncost receivables, against our Allowances for credit losses, when they become contractually more than 180 days past due.\nFor all of our receivables portfolios, we charge off receivables within 30 days of notification and confirmation of a\ncustomer’s bankruptcy or death. However, in some cases of death, we do not charge off receivables if there is a surviving,\ncontractually liable individual or estate large enough to pay the debt in full.\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments on January 1, 2022. This ASU requires the use of an impairment model (the current expected credit loss\n(\"CECL\") model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses. The ASU also allows for a one-time fair value\nelection for receivables. Upon adoption, we elected the fair value option for all remaining loans receivable associated with\nF-9\nour private label credit and general purpose credit card platform previously measured at amortized cost and recorded an\nincrease to our Allowances for credit losses for our remaining Loans at amortized cost associated with our Auto Finance\nsegment. The adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to our opening balance of retained earnings of $8.6 million.\nLoans at fair value. Loans at fair value represent receivables for which we have elected the fair value option (the\n\"Fair Value Receivables\"). The Fair Value Receivables are held by entities that qualify as VIEs, and are consolidated onto\nour consolidated balance sheets, some portfolios of which are unencumbered and some of which are still encumbered under\nstructured or other financing facilities. Loans and finance receivables include accrued and unpaid interest and fees. As\ndiscussed above, as of January 1, 2022 all receivables associated with our private label credit and general purpose credit\ncards are included within this category of receivables.\nUnder the fair value option, direct loan origination fees (such as annual and merchant fees) are taken into income\nwhen billed to the consumer or upon loan acquisition and direct loan origination costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the loans using a discounted cash flow model, which considers various\nunobservable inputs such as credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and yields earned on credit card\nreceivables. The Company re-evaluates the fair value of loans receivable at the close of each measurement period. Changes\nin the fair value of loans are recorded as a component of \"Changes in fair value of loans\" in the consolidated statements of\nincome in the period of the fair value changes. Changes in the fair value of loans include the impact of current period\ncharge-offs associated with these receivables.\nFurther details concerning our loans at fair value are presented within Note 6, \"Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities.\"\nLoans at amortized cost. Our loans at amortized cost, currently consist of receivables associated with our Auto\nFinance segment’s operations. We purchased auto loans with outstanding principal of $233.6 million and $214.7 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, through our pre-qualified network of independent automotive\ndealers and automotive finance companies.\nWe show an allowances for credit losses for our loans at amortized cost. A considerable amount of judgment is\nrequired to assess the ultimate amount of expected losses on loans at amortized cost, and we regularly evaluate and update\nour methodologies to determine the most appropriate allowance necessary. Our loans at amortized cost consist of smaller-\nbalance, homogeneous loans in our Auto Finance segment. These loans are further divided into pools based on common\ncharacteristics such as contract or acquisition channel. For each pool, we determine the necessary allowances for credit\nlosses using reasonable and supportable forecasts that analyze some or all of the following attributes unique to each type of\nreceivable pool: historical loss rates on similar loans; current delinquency and roll-rate trends which may indicate consumer\nloss rates in excess or less than those which historical trends might suggest; vintage analyses based on the number of\nmonths an account has been in existence; the effects of changes in the economy on consumers such as inflation or other\nmacroeconomic changes; changes in underwriting criteria; unfunded commitments (to the extent they are unconditional),\nand estimated recoveries. The aforementioned inputs are calculated using historical trends over the most recent five year\nperiod, and adjusted as needed for current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We may individually evaluate a\nreceivable or pool of receivables for credit losses if circumstances indicate that the receivable or pool of receivables may be\nat higher risk for non-performance than other receivables (e.g., if a particular retail or auto-finance partner has indications\nof non-performance (such as a bankruptcy) that could impact the underlying pool of receivables we purchased from the\npartner).\nCertain of our loans at amortized cost also contain components of deferred revenue related to loan discounts on the\npurchase of our auto finance receivables. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted average\nremaining accretion period for the $17.9 million and $16.2 million of deferred revenue reflected in the consolidated balance\nsheets was 26 and 27 months, respectively.\nA roll-forward (in millions) of our allowances for credit losses by class of receivable is as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Auto Finance\nAllowances for credit losses:\nBalance at beginning of period ...................................................................................................................... $ (1.6)\nProvision for credit losses .......................................................................................................................... (2.2)\nCharge-offs ................................................................................................................................................ 3.9\nRecoveries ................................................................................................................................................. (1.9)\nBalance at end of period ................................................................................................................................ $ (1.8)\nF-10\nOther\nUnsecured\nCredit Auto Lending\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Cards Finance Products Total\nAllowances for credit losses:\nBalance at beginning of period ..................................................... $ (43.4) $ (1.4) $ (12.4) $ (57.2)\nCumulative effects from adoption of fair value under the CECL\nstandard ..................................................................................... 43.4 — 12.4 55.8\nCumulative effects from adoption of the CECL standard ............ — (0.2) (0.2)\nProvision for credit losses ......................................................... — (1.3) — (1.3)\nCharge-offs ............................................................................... — 2.6 — 2.6\nRecoveries ................................................................................ — (1.3) — (1.3)\nBalance at end of period ............................................................... $ — $ (1.6) $ — $ (1.6)\nDelinquent loans at amortized cost reflect the principal, fee and interest components of loans we did not collect on\nor prior to the contractual due date. Amounts we believe we will not ultimately collect are included as a component in our\noverall allowances for credit losses.\nRecoveries, noted above, consist of amounts received from the efforts of third-party collectors. All proceeds\nreceived, associated with charged-off accounts, are credited to the allowances for credit losses.\nWe consider loan delinquencies a key indicator of credit quality because this measure provides the best ongoing\nestimate of how a particular class of receivables is performing. An aging of our delinquent loans at amortized cost (in\nmillions) as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023 Auto Finance\n30-59 days past due ....................................................................................................................................... $ 9.4\n60-89 days past due ....................................................................................................................................... 3.4\n90 or more days past due ............................................................................................................................... 3.5\nDelinquent loans at amortized cost ................................................................................................................ 16.3\nCurrent loans at amortized cost ..................................................................................................................... 101.7\nTotal loans at amortized cost ......................................................................................................................... $ 118.0\nBalance of loans greater than 90-days delinquent still accruing interest and fees ......................................... $ 2.6\nAs of December 31, 2022 Auto Finance\n30-59 days past due ....................................................................................................................................... $ 8.5\n60-89 days past due ....................................................................................................................................... 3.0\n90 or more days past due ............................................................................................................................... 2.1\nDelinquent loans at amortized cost ................................................................................................................ 13.6\nCurrent loans at amortized cost ..................................................................................................................... 91.7\nTotal loans at amortized cost ......................................................................................................................... $ 105.3\nBalance of loans greater than 90-days delinquent still accruing interest and fees ......................................... $ 1.7\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures on January 1, 2023. The disclosures required by this ASU are\nrequired for receivables held at amortized cost and exclude those accounted for using fair value. As the significant majority\nof the Company's receivables are held at fair value, the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the\nCompany's financial results and accompanying disclosures.\nWe review our Loans at amortized cost to determine if any modifications for borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty were made that would qualify the receivable as a Financial Difficulty Modification (\"FDM\"). This could include a\nrestructuring of the loan terms to alleviate the burden of the borrower's near-term cash requirements, such as a modification\nof terms to reduce or defer cash payments to help the borrower attempt to improve its financial condition. For the years\nended December 31, 2023, no Loans at amortized cost qualified as a FDM. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, we\nreviewed our Loans at amortized cost to determine if any modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were\nmade that would qualify the receivable as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\"). This could include a restructuring of the\nF-11\nloan terms to alleviate the burden of the borrower's near-term cash requirements, such as a modification of terms to reduce\nor defer cash payments to help the borrower attempt to improve its financial condition. For the years ended December 31,\n2022, no Loans at amortized cost qualified as a TDR.\nProperty at Cost, Net of Depreciation\nWe capitalize costs related to internal development and implementation of software used in our operating\nactivities. These capitalized costs consist almost exclusively of fees paid to third-party consultants to develop code and\ninstall and test software specific to our needs and to customize purchased software to maximize its benefit to us.\nWe record our property at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We compute depreciation expense\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are approximately 5 years for furniture,\nfixtures and equipment, and 3 years for computers and software. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of\ntheir estimated useful lives or the terms of their respective underlying leases.\nWe periodically review our property to determine if it is impaired. We incurred no impairment costs in the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception, and leases are classified as either operating or\nfinance leases at the lease commencement date. An arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or explicitly identifies an\nasset to be used and conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration. Right-of-use\n(\"ROU\") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation\nto make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the\nlease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. When readily determinable, we use the implicit\nrate within the lease. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the estimated rate of interest for fully collateralized and fully\namortizing borrowings over a similar term as the lease payments at commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate is\nused to determine the present value of lease payments. Our expected lease terms may include options to extend or terminate\nthe lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term\nleases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Expenses associated with operating leases are recorded in\nOther expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not\ncapitalized.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets include amounts paid to third parties for marketing and other services as well as\namounts owed to us by third parties. Prepaid amounts are expensed as the underlying related services are performed. Also\nincluded are (1) commissions paid associated with our various office leases which we amortize into expense over the lease\nterms, (2) ongoing deferred costs associated with service contracts and (3) investments in consumer finance technology\nplatforms carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses reflect both the billed and unbilled amounts owed at the end of a period\nfor services rendered.\nRevenue Recognition and Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nConsumer Loans, Including Past Due Fees\nConsumer loans, including past due fees reflect interest income, including finance charges, and late fees on loans\nin accordance with the terms of the related customer agreements. Discounts received associated with auto loans that are not\nincluded as part of our Fair Value Receivables are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related loans using\nthe effective interest method. Premiums, discounts, annual fees and merchant fees paid or received associated with Fair\nValue Receivables are recognized upon receivable acquisition. Finance charges and fees, net of amounts that we consider\nuncollectible, are included in loans, interest and fees receivable and revenue when the fees are earned based upon the\ncontractual terms of the loans.\nF-12\nFees and Related Income on Earning Assets\nFees and related income on earning assets primarily include fees associated with credit products such as annual fee\nbillings and cash advance fees, among others. These fees are assessed on the receivables underlying the private label and\ngeneral purpose credit cards we service.\nFees are assessed on private label and general purpose credit card accounts underlying our credit card receivables\naccording to the terms of the related agreements and we recognize these fees as income when they are charged to the\ncustomers’ accounts. Fees and related income on earning assets, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included\nin loans, interest and fees receivable and revenue when the fees are earned based upon the contractual terms of the loans.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue includes revenues associated with interchange revenues, servicing income and ancillary product\nofferings (primarily associated with a credit protection program offered by our issuing bank partner). We recognize these\nfees as income in the period earned.\nOther non-operating revenue\nOther non-operating revenue includes revenues associated with investments in equity method investees and other\nrevenues not associated with our ongoing business operations.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe majority of our revenue is earned from financial instruments and is not included within the scope of\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". We have determined that\nrevenue from contracts with customers would primarily consist of interchange revenues in our CaaS segment and servicing\nrevenue and other customer-related fees in both our CaaS segment and our Auto Finance segment. Interchange fees are\nearned when our customers’ cards are used over established card networks. We earn a portion of the interchange fee the\ncard networks charge merchants for the transaction and these fees are settled daily. Servicing revenue is generated by\nmeeting contractual performance obligations related to the collection of amounts due on receivables, and is settled with the\ncustomer net of our fee, which can be settled daily or monthly. Service charges and other customer related fees are earned\nfrom customers based on the occurrence of specific services and are paid by customers per the terms of their credit\nagreement. None of these revenue streams result in an ongoing obligation beyond what has already been rendered. Revenue\nfrom these contracts with customers comprises Other revenue on our consolidated statements of income. Components (in\nthousands) of our revenue from contracts with customers is as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023 CaaS Auto Finance Total\nInterchange revenues, net (1) ............................................................. $ 21,453 $ — $ 21,453\nServicing income ................................................................................ 3,340 749 4,089\nService charges and other customer related fees ................................ 11,731 75 11,806\nTotal revenue from contracts with customers ............................. $ 36,524 $ 824 $ 37,348\n(1) Interchange revenue is presented net of customer reward expense.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022 CaaS Auto Finance Total\nInterchange revenues, net (1) ............................................................. $ 24,926 $ — $ 24,926\nServicing income ................................................................................ 3,259 888 4,147\nService charges and other customer related fees ................................ 13,658 67 13,725\nTotal revenue from contracts with customers ..................................... $ 41,843 $ 955 $ 42,798\n(1) Interchange revenue is presented net of customer reward expense.\nF-13\nCard and Loan Servicing Expenses\nCard and loan servicing costs primarily include collections and customer service expenses. Within this category of\nexpenses are personnel, service bureau, cardholder correspondence and other direct costs associated with our collections\nand customer service efforts. Card and loan servicing costs also include outsourced collections and customer service\nexpenses. We expense card and loan servicing costs as we incur them, with the exception of prepaid costs, which we\nexpense over respective service periods.\nMarketing and Solicitation Expenses\nWe expense product solicitation costs, including printing, credit bureaus, list processing, telemarketing, postage,\nand internet marketing fees, as we incur these costs or expend resources.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The\nguidance requires an assessment of credit losses based on expected rather than incurred losses (known as the current\nexpected credit loss model). This generally will result in the recognition of allowances for losses earlier than under current\naccounting guidance for trade and other receivables, held to maturity debt securities and other instruments. The FASB has\nadded several technical amendments (ASU 2018-19, 2019-04, 2019-10, 2019-11 and 2020-03) to clarify technical aspects\nof the guidance and applicability to specific financial instruments or transactions. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU\n2019-05, which allows entities to measure assets in the scope of ASC 326-20, except held to maturity securities, using the\nfair value option when they adopt the new credit impairment standard. The election can be made on an instrument by\ninstrument basis. We adopted ASU 2016-13 beginning January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method of\nadoption. We elected the fair value option for all receivables in our CaaS segment previously measured at amortized cost.\nFor all other receivables, we recorded an increase to our Allowances for credit losses using the current expected credit loss\nmodel. As a result of our adoption, we increased our Loans at fair value (net of the related revaluation) by $315.0 million\n(with a corresponding decrease to Loans at amortized cost of $375.7 million), a decrease to our Allowances for credit losses\nof $55.6 million, a decrease to our Deferred revenue of $15.6 million, a decrease to Accounts payable and accrued expenses\nof $600 thousand, an increase to our deferred tax liability of $2.5 million, and an increase to our retained earnings of $8.6\nmillion. The aforementioned impacts associated with our adoption of ASU 2016-13 primarily relate to those assets within\nour CaaS segment with an immaterial impact to our Auto Finance segment receivables.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides an optional expedient and exceptions for\napplying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by\nreference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Scope, which refines the scope of ASC 848 and clarifies some of its guidance as part of the FASB’s\nmonitoring of global reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, \"Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848\", to extend the temporary accounting rules under Topic 848 from\nDecember 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. These ASUs are effective for all entities upon their respective issuance dates\nthrough December 31, 2024. We have reviewed all outstanding financial agreements, noting none utilize London Interbank\nOffered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as the reference rate and, as such, determined there is no impact to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn March 31, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled\nDebt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings\nby creditors while adding disclosures for certain loan restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty. This guidance requires an entity to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an\nexisting loan. Additionally, the ASU requires disclosure of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for\nfinancing receivables. The disclosures required by this ASU are required for receivables held at amortized cost and exclude\nthose accounted for using fair value. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2023. As the significant majority of the\nCompany's receivables are held at fair value, the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's\nfinancial results and accompanying disclosures.\nF-14\n3. Segment Reporting\nWe operate primarily within one industry consisting of two reportable segments by which we manage our\nbusiness. Our two reportable segments are: CaaS and Auto Finance.\nWe have no material amounts of long lived assets located outside of the U.S.\nWe measure the profitability of our reportable segments based on their income after allocation of specific costs\nand corporate overhead; however, our segment results do not reflect any charges for internal capital allocations among our\nsegments. Overhead costs are allocated based on headcounts and other applicable measures to better align costs with the\nassociated revenues.\nSummary operating segment information (in thousands) is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 CaaS Auto Finance Total\nRevenue:\nConsumer loans, including past due fees ............................. $ 839,995 $ 39,128 $ 879,123\nFees and related income on earning assets ........................... 238,691 84 238,775\nOther revenue ....................................................................... 36,524 824 37,348\nTotal operating revenue, net ............................................................... 1,115,210 40,036 1,155,246\nOther non-operating revenue ................................................ 422 208 630\nTotal revenue .................................................................................. 1,115,632 40,244 1,155,876\nInterest expense ..............................................................................

Shareholders’ Equity and Preferred Stock\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased and contemporaneously retired 575,156\nshares and 1,674,161 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.6 million and $88.9 million, respectively,\npursuant to both open market and private purchases and the return of stock by holders of equity incentive awards to pay tax\nwithholding obligations.\nF-15\nPreferred Stock\nIn June and July 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,188,533 shares of 7.625% Series B Cumulative Perpetual\nPreferred Stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\"), liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (the \"Series B Preferred\nStock\"), for net proceeds of approximately $76.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but\nbefore deducting expenses and the structuring fee. We pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock,\nwhen and as declared by our Board of Directors, in the amount of $1.90625 per share each year, which is equivalent to\n7.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased and contemporaneously retired 1,806 shares\nand 3,500 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate cost of $29,000 and $69,000, respectively.\nATM Programs\nOn August 10, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \"Preferred Stock\nSales Agreement\") providing for the sale by the Company of up to an aggregate offering price of $100.0 million of our (i)\nSeries B Preferred Stock and (ii) senior notes, from time to time through a sales agent, in connection with the Company's\n\"at-the-market\" offering program (the \"Preferred Stock ATM Program\"). Further, on December 29, 2023, the Company\nentered into an At-The-Market Sales Agreement (the \"Common Stock Sales Agreement\") providing for the sale by the\nCompany of its common stock, no par value per share, up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million, from time to time\nto or through a sales agent, in connection with the Company’s Common Stock ATM Program (\"Common Stock ATM\nProgram\"). Sales pursuant to both the Preferred Stock Sales Agreement and Common Stock Sales Agreement, if any, may\nbe made in transactions that are deemed to be \"at-the-market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The sales agents will\nmake all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices up to the\namount specified in, and otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the placement notices.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we sold 53,727 shares and 19,607 shares, respectively of\nour Series B Preferred Stock under our Preferred Stock ATM Program for net proceeds of $1.1 million and $0.4 million,\nrespectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no common shares were sold under the Company’s Common\nStock ATM Program.\n5. Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove\nVentures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (\"Dove\"). The agreement provided for a senior secured term loan\nfacility in an amount of up to $40.0 million at any time outstanding. On December 27, 2019, the Company issued 400,000\nshares of its Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $40.0 million, in exchange for full\nsatisfaction of the $40.0 million that the Company owed Dove under the Loan and Security Agreement. Dividends on the\npreferred stock are 6% per annum (cumulative, non-compounding) and are payable as declared, and in preference to any\ndividends on common stock and Series B Preferred Stock, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no\nmaturity date. The Company may, at its option, redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on or after January 1, 2025 at\na redemption price equal to $100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. At the request of holders of a\nmajority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company shall offer to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Stock at\na redemption price equal to $100 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, at the option of the holders thereof,\non or after January 1, 2024. Upon the election by the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, each\nshare of the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into the number of shares of the Company’s common stock as is\ndetermined by dividing (i) the sum of (a) $100 and (b) any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such share by (ii) an\ninitial conversion price equal to $10 per share, subject to certain adjustment in certain circumstances to prevent dilution.\nGiven the redemption rights contained within the Series A Preferred Stock, we account for the outstanding preferred stock\nas temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock are deducted from\nNet income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to common shareholders. The common\nstock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock is included in our calculation of Net income attributable to\ncommon shareholders per share—diluted. See Note 13, \"Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common\nShare\" for more information.\nDove is a limited liability company owned by three trusts. David G. Hanna is the sole shareholder and the\nPresident of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of one of the trusts, and David G. Hanna and members of his\nimmediate family are the beneficiaries of this trust. Frank J. Hanna, III is the sole shareholder and the President of the\nF-16\ncorporation that serves as the sole trustee of the other two trusts, and Frank J. Hanna, III and members of his immediate\nfamily are the beneficiaries of these other two trusts.\nOn November 14, 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary issued 50.5 million Class B preferred units at a purchase price\nof $1.00 per unit to an unrelated third party. The units carry a 16% preferred return to be paid quarterly, with up to 6\npercentage points of the preferred return to be paid through the issuance of additional units or cash, at our election. The\nunits have both call and put rights and are also subject to various covenants including a minimum book value, which if not\nsatisfied, could allow for the securities to be put back to the subsidiary. In March 2020, the subsidiary issued an additional\n50.0 million Class B preferred units under the same terms. A holder of the Class B Preferred Units may, at its election,\nrequire the Company to redeem part or all of such holder’s Class B Preferred Units for cash at $1.00 per unit, on or after\nOctober 14, 2024. The proceeds from the transaction are being used for general corporate purposes. The Company has the\nright to redeem the Class B Preferred Units at any time with notice. We have included the issuance of these Class B\npreferred units as temporary noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends paid on the Class B\npreferred units are deducted from Net income attributable to controlling interests to derive Net income attributable to\ncommon shareholders. See Note 13, \"Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share\" for more\ninformation.\n6. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in\nthe principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on\nthe measurement date.\nWe update our fair value analysis each quarter, with changes since the prior reporting period reflected as a\ncomponent of \"Changes in fair value of loans\" in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in interest rates, credit\nspreads, discount rates, realized and projected credit losses and cash flow timing will lead to changes in the fair value of\nloans and therefore impact earnings.\nFair value differs from amortized cost accounting in the following ways:\n● Receivables are recorded at their fair value, not their principal and fee balance or cost basis;\n● The fair value of the loans takes into consideration net charge-offs for the remaining life of the loans with no\nseparate allowance for credit loss calculation;\n● Certain fee billings (such as annual or merchant fees) and expenses of loans are no longer deferred but\nrecognized (when billed or incurred) in income or expense, respectively;\n● The net present value of cash flows associated with future fee billings on existing receivables are included in\nfair value;\n● Changes in the fair value of loans impact net margins; and\n● Net charge-offs are recognized as they occur rather than through the establishment of an allowance and\nprovision for credit losses for those loans, interest and fees receivable carried at amortized cost.\nFor receivables that are carried at net amortized cost, we include disclosures of the fair value of such receivables to\nthe extent practicable within the disclosures below.\nWhere applicable, we account for our financial assets and liabilities at fair value based upon a three-tiered\nvaluation system. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs use quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs use inputs other\nthan quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2\ninputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market\nactivity for the asset or liability. Where inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value\nhierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined\nis based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nF-17\nValuations and Techniques for Assets\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires\njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The table below summarizes (in thousands) by fair value\nhierarchy the December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 fair values and carrying amounts of (1) our assets that are\nrequired to be carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements and (2) our assets not carried at fair value, but\nfor which fair value disclosures are required:\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Carrying\nAssets Inputs Inputs Amount of\nAssets – As of December 31, 2023 (1) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets\nLoans at amortized cost for which it is practicable to\nestimate fair value and which are carried at net\namortized cost ................................................................... $ — $ — $ 105,409 $ 98,425\nLoans at fair value ................................................................ $ — $ — $ 2,173,759 $ 2,173,759\n(1) For cash, deposits and investments in equity securities, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of\nfair value.\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable Carrying\nAssets Inputs Inputs Amount of\nAssets – As of December 31, 2022 (1) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets\nLoans at amortized cost for which it is practicable to\nestimate fair value and which are carried at net\namortized cost ................................................................... $ — $ — $ 94,968 $ 87,434\nLoans at fair value ................................................................ $ — $ — $ 1,817,976 $ 1,817,976\n(1) For cash, deposits and investments in equity securities, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of\nfair value.\nFor those asset classes above that are required to be carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements,\ngains and losses associated with fair value changes are detailed on our consolidated statements of income as a component of\n\"Changes in fair value of loans\". For our loans, interest and fees receivable included in the above table, we assess the fair\nvalue of these assets based on our estimate of future cash flows net of servicing costs, and to the extent that such cash flow\nestimates change from period to period, any such changes are considered to be attributable to changes in instrument-\nspecific credit risk.\nFor Level 3 assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, the\nfollowing table presents (in thousands) a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022:\nLoans at Fair Value\n2023 2022\nBalance at January 1, $ 1,817,976 $ 1,026,424\nCumulative effects from adoption of fair value under the CECL standard — 314,985\nChanges in fair value of loans at fair value, included in earnings 71,024 (32,574 )\nChanges in fair value due to principal charge-offs, net of recoveries (538,146) (367,213 )\nChanges in fair value due to finance and fee charge-offs (222,455) (177,282 )\nPurchases 2,427,095 2,466,676\nFinance and fees, added to the account balance 970,006 874,749\nSettlements (2,351,741) (2,287,789 )\nBalance at December 31, $ 2,173,759 $ 1,817,976\nF-18\nThe unrealized gains and losses for assets within the Level 3 category presented in the tables above include\nchanges in fair value that are attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.\nLoans at Fair Value. The fair value of loans at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows using a\nvaluation model of expected cash flows and the estimated cost to service and collect those cash flows. We estimate the\npresent value of these future cash flows using internally-developed estimates of assumptions third-party market participants\nwould use in determining fair value, including estimates of credit losses, payment rates, servicing costs, discount rates and\nyields earned on credit card receivables.\nFor Level 3 assets carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs, the\nfollowing table presents quantitative information about the valuation techniques and the inputs used in the fair value\nmeasurement as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our fair value models include market degradation to reflect\nthe possibility of delinquency rates increasing in the near term (and the corresponding increase in charge-offs and decrease\nin payments) above the level that historical and current trends would suggest. This market degradation is included in the\nbelow quantitative information:\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurement\nFair Value at December 31, Valuation Unobservable Range (Weighted\nFair Value Measurement 2023 (in thousands) Technique Input Average)(1)\nGross yield, net of\nDiscounted cash finance charge\nLoans at fair value ................. $ 2,173,759 flows charge-offs 28.3% to 38.4% (34.5%)\nPayment rate 9.5% to 9.6% (9.5%)\nExpected principal\ncredit loss rate 30.8% to 35.6% (32.7%)\nServicing rate 3.0% to 3.4% (3.2%)\nDiscount rate 7.1% to 13.1% (10.0%)\nFair Value at December 31, Valuation Unobservable Range (Weighted\nFair Value Measurement 2022 (in thousands) Technique Input Average)(1)\nGross yield, net of\nDiscounted cash finance charge\nLoans at fair value ................. $ 1,817,976 flows charge-offs 24.7% to 36.1% (31.6%)\nPayment rate 5.0% to 11.4% (10.3%)\nExpected principal\ncredit loss rate 9.2% to 30.3% (30.2%)\nServicing rate 3.5% to 6.4% (3.6%)\nDiscount rate 5.6% to 15.0% (10.1%)\n(1) Weighted average rates are calculated using the quotient of the gross outstanding balance of receivables\nat period end for each pool of receivables and the entire pool of receivables multiplied by the applicable\nrate for each pool of receivables\nF-19\nValuations and Techniques for Liabilities\nOur assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires\njudgment and considers factors specific to the liability.

We have evaluated\nthe fair value of our third party debt by analyzing the expected repayment terms and credit spreads included in our recent\nfinancing arrangements obtained with similar terms. These recent financing arrangements provide positive evidence that the\nunderlying data used in our assessment of fair value has not changed relative to the general market and therefore the fair\nvalue of our debt continues to be the same as the carrying value.

Variable Interest Entities\nThe Company contributes the vast majority of receivables to VIEs. These entities are sometimes established to\nfacilitate third party financing. When assets are contributed to a VIE, they serve as collateral for the debt securities issued\nby that VIE. The evaluation of whether the entity qualifies as a VIE is based upon the sufficiency of the equity at risk in the\nlegal entity. This evaluation is generally a function of the level of excess collateral in the legal entity. We consolidate VIEs\nwhen we hold a variable interest and we have exposure to loss that has the potential to be significant and therefore, are the\nprimary beneficiary. Through our role as servicer, we have the power to direct activities to service the receivables (in\naccordance with defined servicing procedures), and as such, have the ability to significantly impact the economic\nperformance of those VIEs. In certain circumstances we guarantee the performance of the underlying debt or agree to\ncontribute additional collateral when necessary, which results in retention of exposure to loss that has the potential to be\nsignificant. As a result, the Company is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIEs. When collateral is pledged, it is\nnot available for the general use of the Company and can only be used to satisfy the related debt obligation. The results of\noperations and financial position of consolidated VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement and held a variable\ninterest (in millions):\nAs of\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents ........................................................................... $ 158.0 $ 202.2\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents ............................................................................... 20.5 27.6\nLoans at fair value ........................................................................................................... 2,128.6 1,735.9\nTotal Assets held by VIEs ............................................................................................... $ 2,307.1 $ 1,965.7\nNotes Payable, net held by VIEs ..................................................................................... $ 1,795.9 $ 1,586.0\nMaximum exposure to loss due to involvement with VIEs ............................................. $ 2,099.0 $ 1,756.0\n9. Leases\nWe have operating leases primarily associated with our corporate offices and regional service centers as well as\nfor certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 to 11 years, some of which include options, at our\ndiscretion, to extend the leases for additional periods generally on one-year revolving periods. Other leases allow for us to\nterminate the lease based on appropriate notification periods. For certain of our leased offices, we sublease a portion of the\nunoccupied space. The components of lease expense associated with our lease liabilities and supplemental cash flow\ninformation related to those leases were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease cost, gross .............................................................................................. $ 2,558 $ 4,431\nSublease income ..............................................................................................................

This lease covers approximately 73,000 square feet and commenced in June 2022 for a\n146 month term. The total commitment under this lease is approximately $27.8 million and is included in the table above.\nIn connection with the commencement of this lease, we discontinued most of the subleasing arrangements with third\nparties for space at our corporate headquarters. A right-of-use asset and liability was recorded at the commencement date\nof this lease.\nIn addition, we occasionally lease certain equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable leases, which are\naccounted for as capital leases in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2023, we had no material\nnon-cancelable capital leases with initial or remaining terms of more than one year.\nF-23\n10.

See Note 8, \"Variable Interest Entities\" for more information.\n(6) Creditors do not have recourse against the general assets of the Company but only to the collateral within the VIEs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Prime Rate was 8.50% and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") was\n*\n5.38%.\nIn October 2015, we (through a wholly owned subsidiary) entered a revolving credit facility with a (as\nsubsequently amended) $50.0 million revolving borrowing limit that can be drawn to the extent of outstanding eligible\nprincipal receivables (of which $38.6 million was drawn as of December 31, 2023). This facility is secured by the loans,\ninterest and fees receivable and related restricted cash and accrues interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 3.0%. The\nfacility matures on October 30, 2025 and is subject to certain affirmative covenants, including a liquidity test and an\neligibility test, the failure of which could result in required early repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance.\nThe facility is guaranteed by Atlanticus, which is required to maintain certain minimum liquidity levels.\nIn October 2016, we (through a wholly owned subsidiary) entered a revolving credit facility available to the\nextent of outstanding eligible principal receivables of our CAR subsidiary (of which $42.7 million was drawn as of\nDecember 31, 2023). This facility is secured by the financial and operating assets of CAR and accrues interest at an annual\nrate equal to SOFR plus a range between 2.25% and 2.6% based on certain ratios. The loan is subject to certain affirmative\ncovenants, including a coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a collateral performance test, the failure of which could result\nin required early repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance. In periods subsequent to October 2016, we\namended the original agreement to either extend the maturity date and/or expand the capacity of this revolving credit\nfacility. As of December 31, 2023, the facility's borrowing limit was $65.0 million and the facility matures on November\n1, 2025.

An amendment was completed in July 2023 that extended the\nmaturity to July 20, 2025. There were no other material changes to the existing terms. The facility is subject to certain\naffirmative covenants, including payment, delinquency and charge-off tests, the failure of which could result in required\nearly repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance. The note is guaranteed by Atlanticus.\nIn 2018, we (through a wholly owned subsidiary) entered a revolving credit facility to sell up to an aggregate\n$100.0 million of notes that are secured by the receivables and other assets of the trust (of which $0.0 million was\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023) that can be drawn upon to the extent of outstanding eligible receivables. The\ninterest rate on the notes equals the SOFR plus 3.75%. The facility matures on December 15, 2025, and is subject to\ncertain affirmative covenants and collateral performance tests, the failure of which could result in required early\nrepayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance of notes. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate borrowing limit\nwas $100.0 million.\nIn June 2019, we (through a wholly owned subsidiary) entered a revolving credit facility with a (as subsequently\namended) $20.0 million revolving borrowing limit that is available to the extent of outstanding eligible principal\nreceivables (of which $14.3 million was drawn as of December 31, 2023).

The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and\nrank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated\nindebtedness, and will rank senior in right of payment to the Company’s future subordinated indebtedness, if any. The\nsenior notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of\nthe value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and\nfuture indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries (excluding any amounts\nowed by such subsidiaries to the Company).

The senior notes\nwill mature on November 30, 2026. We are amortizing fees associated with the issuance of the senior notes into interest\nexpense over the expected life of the notes. Amortization of these fees for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\ntotaled $1.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. We repurchased $1.4 million and $0.0 of the outstanding principal\namount of these senior notes for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nGeneral\nUnder finance products available in the private label credit and general purpose credit card channels, consumers\nhave the ability to borrow up to the maximum credit limit assigned to each individual’s account. Unfunded commitments\nunder these products aggregated $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023. We have never experienced a situation in which all\nborrowers have exercised their entire available lines of credit at any given point in time, nor do we anticipate this will ever\noccur in the future. Moreover, there would be a concurrent increase in assets should there be any exercise of these lines of\ncredit.\nAdditionally, our CAR operations provide floor-plan financing for a pre-qualified network of independent\nautomotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy-here, pay-here used car business. The floor plan financing\nallows dealers and finance companies to borrow up to the maximum pre-approved credit limit allowed in order to finance\nongoing inventory needs. These loans are secured by the underlying auto inventory and, in certain cases where we have\nother lending products outstanding with the dealer, are secured by the collateral under those lending arrangements as well,\nincluding any outstanding dealer reserves. As of December 31, 2023, CAR had unfunded outstanding floor-plan financing\ncommitments totaling $10.2 million. Each draw against unused commitments is reviewed for conformity to pre-established\nguidelines and is not unconditional.\nUnder agreements with third-party originating and other financial institutions, we have pledged security\n(collateral) related to their issuance of consumer credit and purchases thereunder, of which $23.8 million remains pledged\nas of December 31, 2023 to support various ongoing contractual obligations.\nF-27\nUnder agreements with third-party originating and other financial institutions, we have agreed to indemnify the\nfinancial institutions for certain liabilities associated with the services we provide on behalf of the financial institutions—\nsuch indemnification obligations generally being limited to instances in which we either (a) have been afforded the\nopportunity to defend against any potentially indemnifiable claims or (b) have reached agreement with the financial\ninstitutions regarding settlement of potentially indemnifiable claims. As of December 31, 2023, we have assessed the\nlikelihood of any potential payments related to the aforementioned contingencies as remote. We would accrue liabilities\nrelated to these contingencies in any future period if and in which we assess the likelihood of an estimable payment as\nprobable.\nUnder the account terms, consumers have the option of enrolling with our issuing bank partners in a credit\nprotection program, which would make the minimum payments owed on their accounts for a period of up to six months\nupon the occurrence of an eligible event. Eligible events typically include loss of life, job loss, disability, or hospitalization.\nAs an acquirer of receivables, our potential exposure under this program, if all eligible participants applied for this benefit,\nwas $75.2 million as of December 31, 2023. We have never experienced a situation in which all eligible participants have\napplied for this benefit at any given point in time, nor do we anticipate this will ever occur in the future. We include our\nestimate of future claims under this program within our fair value analysis of the associated receivables.\nConcentrations\nWe acquire all of our fair value receivables under agreements with two third-party originating institutions.\nOur five largest retail partners account for over 70% of our outstanding private label credit receivables as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Our receivables base is diverse and spread across individual consumers in the U.S. As of December\n31, 2023, only one state (Texas) had receivables concentration in excess of 10% of the total pool of receivables.\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. There are currently\nno pending legal proceedings that are expected to be material to us.\n12. Income Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of\ntemporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and\ntheir respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe current and deferred portions (in thousands) of our federal, foreign, and state and other income tax expenses\nor benefits are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal income tax (expense):\nCurrent tax benefit .................................................................................................... $ 11,536 $ 4,352\nDeferred tax (expense) ............................................................................................. (34,056) (16,623 )\nTotal federal income tax (expense) ................................................................................. $ (22,520) $ (12,271 )\nForeign income tax (expense):\nCurrent tax (expense) ............................................................................................... $ (124) $ (183 )\nDeferred tax benefit .................................................................................................. 10 3\nTotal foreign income tax (expense) ................................................................................. $ (114) $ (180 )\nState and other income tax (expense):\nCurrent tax (expense) benefit ................................................................................... $ (191) $ 2,146\nDeferred tax (expense) .............................................................................................

Our effective income tax expense rates for these years are below the statutory rate\nprincipally due to (1) deductions associated with the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock at times\nwhen the fair value of our stock exceeded such share-based awards’ grant date values and (2) our deduction for income tax\npurposes of amounts characterized in our consolidated financial statements as dividends on a preferred stock issuance, such\namounts constituting deductible interest expense on a debt issuance for tax purposes. Offsetting the above factors are the\neffects on our effective tax rate of state and foreign income tax expense, taxes on global intangible low-taxed income, and\nexecutive compensation deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code. Further details related to the above are\nreflected in the table below reconciling our effective income tax expense rate to the statutory rate.\nWe report income tax-related interest and penalties (including those associated with both our accrued liabilities for\nuncertain tax positions and unpaid tax liabilities) within our income tax line item on our consolidated statements of\nincome. We likewise report the reversal of income tax-related interest and penalties within such line item to the extent we\nresolve our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or unpaid tax liabilities in a manner favorable to our accruals therefor. We\nrecognized $0.4 million in potential interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to de minimis interest expense experienced in 2022.\nThe following table reconciles our effective income tax expense rate to the statutory rate for 2023 and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nStatutory federal expense rate ......................................................................................... 21.0 % 21.0%\n(Decrease) increase in statutory federal tax expense rate resulting from:\nShare-based compensation .......................................................................................

The ultimate\nrealization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which\ntemporary differences are deductible. In making our valuation allowance determinations, we consider all available positive\nand negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including our past and anticipated future performance, the\nreversal of deferred tax liabilities, the length of carry-back and carry-forward periods, and the implementation of tax\nplanning strategies. Because our valuation allowance evaluations require consideration of future events, significant\njudgment is required in making the evaluations, and our conclusions could be materially different if our expectations are not\nmet. Our valuation allowances totaled $18.7 million and $20.7 million as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\nCertain of our deferred tax assets relate to federal, foreign, and state net operating losses, and we have no other net\noperating loss, capital loss, or credit carryforwards other than those noted herein. We have recorded a federal deferred tax\nasset of $35.2 million (based on indefinite-lived federal net operating loss carryforwards of $167.3 million). We have\nrecorded state deferred tax assets of $26.5 million based on state net operating loss carryforwards, some of which are\nindefinite-lived and some which expire in various years beginning in 2024; valuation allowances of $18.2 million have be\nrecorded, however, against the $26.5 million of such state deferred tax assets.\nOur subsidiaries file federal, foreign, and/or state and other income tax returns. In the normal course of our\nbusiness, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as\nthe U.S., the U.K., and various U.S. states and territories. With a few exceptions of a non-material nature, we are no longer\nsubject to federal, state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for years prior to 2019.\nF-30\nRoll-forwards (in thousands) of our unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest related thereto of $1.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2022) from the beginning to the end of 2023 and\n2022, respectively, are as follows:\n2023 2022\nBalance at January 1, ....................................................................................................... $ (22,692) $ (605 )\nReductions based on tax positions related to prior years .......................................... 21,983 79\n(Additions) based on tax positions related to prior years ......................................... — (11,965 )\n(Additions) based on tax positions related to the current year ................................. (29) (10,201 )\nBalance at December 31, ................................................................................................. $ (738) $ (22,692 )\nOur unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax expense rate are not material at only\n$1.1million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n13. Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests Per Common Share\nWe compute net income attributable to controlling interests per common share by dividing net income attributable\nto controlling interests by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (including participating securities)\noutstanding during the period, as discussed below. Diluted computations applicable in financial reporting periods in which\nwe report income use the treasury stock method to reflect the potential dilution to the basic income per share of common\nstock computations that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, were converted\ninto common stock or were to result in the issuance of common stock that would share in our results of operations. In\nperforming our net income attributable to controlling interests per share of common stock computations, we apply\naccounting rules that require us to include all unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding in our basic and diluted calculations.\nCommon stock and certain unvested share-based payment awards earn dividends equally, and we have included all\noutstanding restricted stock awards in our basic and diluted calculations for current and prior periods.\nThe following table sets forth the computations of net income attributable to controlling interests per share of\ncommon stock (in thousands, except per share data):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to controlling interests ....................................................... $ 102,845 $ 135,597\nPreferred stock and preferred unit dividends and discount accretion ....................... (25,198) (25,076 )\nNet income attributable to common shareholders—basic ........................................ 77,647 110,521\nEffect of dilutive preferred stock dividends and discount accretion ........................ 2,400 2,400\nNet income attributable to common shareholders—diluted ..................................... $ 80,047 $ 112,921\nDenominator:\nBasic (including unvested share-based payment awards) (1) ................................... 14,504 14,629\nEffect of dilutive stock compensation arrangements and exchange of preferred\nstock ...................................................................................................................... 4,378 4,747\nDiluted (including unvested share-based payment awards) (1) ................................ 18,882 19,376\nNet income attributable to common shareholders per share—basic ........................ $ 5.35 $ 7.55\nNet income attributable to common shareholders per share—diluted ...................... $ 4.24 $ 5.83\n(1) Shares related to unvested share-based payment awards included in our basic and diluted share counts\nwere 230,428 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 137,046 for the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nAs their effects were anti-dilutive, we excluded stock options to purchase 0.1 million shares from our net income\nattributable to controlling interests per share of common stock calculations for the year ended December 31, 2023. We\nexcluded stock options to purchase 0.1 million shares from our net income attributable to controlling interests per share of\ncommon stock calculations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nF-31\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we included 4.0 million shares of common stock for each\nperiod in our outstanding diluted share counts associated with our Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 5, \"Redeemable\nPreferred Stock\", for a further discussion of these convertible securities.\n14. Stock-Based Compensation\nWe currently have two stock-based compensation plans, the Second Amended and Restated Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan (the \"ESPP\") and the Fourth Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Fourth Amended 2014\nPlan\"). Our ESPP provides that we may issue up to 500,000 shares of our common stock under the plan. Our Fourth\nAmended 2014 Plan provides that we may grant up to 5,750,000 options on or shares of our common stock (and other types\nof equity awards) to members of our Board of Directors, employees, consultants and advisors. The Fourth Amended 2014\nPlan was approved by our shareholders in May 2019. As of December 31, 2023, 47,111 shares remained available for\nissuance under the ESPP and 2,134,266 shares remained available for issuance under the Fourth Amended 2014 Plan.\nExercises and vestings under our stock-based compensation plans resulted in no income tax-related charges to\npaid-in capital during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we granted 148,546 shares and 105,360 shares of restricted\nstock and restricted stock units (net of any forfeitures), respectively, with aggregate grant date fair values of $3.7 million\nand $4.9 million, respectively. We incurred expenses of $3.1 million and $2.6 million during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, related to restricted stock awards. When we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units,\nwe defer the grant date value of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit and amortize that value (net of the value of\nanticipated forfeitures) as compensation expense with an offsetting entry to the paid-in capital component of our\nconsolidated shareholders’ equity. Our restricted stock awards typically vest over a range of 12 to 60 months (or other term\nas specified in the grant which may include the achievement of performance measures) and are amortized to salaries and\nbenefits expense ratably over applicable vesting periods. As of December 31, 2023, our unamortized deferred compensation\ncosts associated with non-vested restricted stock awards were $3.9 million with a weighted-average remaining amortization\nperiod of 2.6 years. No forfeitures have been included in our compensation cost estimates based on historical forfeiture\nrates.\nThe table below includes additional information about outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nNumber of Date Fair\nShares Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 ................................................................................. 147,317 $ 40.88\nIssued............................................................................................................................... 152,446 $ 25.26\nVested ..............................................................................................................................

(3,900 ) $ 37.51\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 ................................................................................. 244,225 $ 32.75\nF-32\nStock Options\nThe exercise price per share of the options awarded under the Fourth Amended 2014 Plan must be equal to or\ngreater than the market price on the date the option is granted. The option period may not exceed 10 years from the date of\ngrant. We had expense of $0.7 million and $1.6 million related to stock option-related compensation costs during the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. When applicable, we recognize stock option-related compensation\nexpense for any awards with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. The table\nbelow includes additional information about outstanding options:\nWeighted\nAverage of\nWeighted Remaining\nAverage Contractual Aggregate\nNumber of Exercise Life (in Intrinsic\nShares Price years) Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 .............................................. 802,163 $ 12.23\nIssued............................................................................................ — $ —\nExercised ......................................................................................

We had $0.1 million and $0.8\nmillion of unamortized deferred compensation costs associated with non-vested stock options as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, with a weighted average remaining amortization period of 0.5 years as of December 31, 2023.\nUpon exercise of outstanding options, the Company issues new shares.\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\nWe maintain a defined contribution retirement plan (\"401(k) plan\") for our U.S. employees that provides for a\nmatching contribution by us. All full time U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. We made matching\ncontributions of $748,734 and $341,245 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were\nincluded as a component of Salaries and benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAlso, all employees, excluding executive officers, are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Under the ESPP,\nemployees can elect to have up to 10% of their annual wages withheld to purchase our common stock up to a fair market\nvalue of $10,000. The amounts deducted and accumulated by each participant are used to purchase shares of common stock\non or as promptly as practicable after the last business day of each month. The price of stock purchased under the ESPP is\napproximately 85% of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the purchase date. Employees contributed\n$108,351 to purchase 3,929 shares of common stock in 2023 and $107,995 to purchase 3,280 shares of common stock in\n2022 under the ESPP. The ESPP covers up to 100,000 shares of common stock. Our charge to expense associated with the\nESPP was $35,691 and $35,348 in 2023 and 2022 respectively, which were included as a component of Salaries and\nbenefits in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-33\n16. Related Party Transactions\nUnder a shareholders’ agreement which we entered into with certain shareholders, including David G. Hanna,\nFrank J. Hanna, III and certain trusts that were Hanna affiliates, following our initial public offering (1) if one or more of\nthe shareholders accepts a bona fide offer from a third party to purchase more than 50% of the outstanding common stock,\neach of the other shareholders that is a party to the agreement may elect to sell his shares to the purchaser on the same terms\nand conditions, and (2) if shareholders that are a party to the agreement owning more than 50% of the common stock\npropose to transfer all of their shares to a third party, then such transferring shareholders may require the other shareholders\nthat are a party to the agreement to sell all of the shares owned by them to the proposed transferee on the same terms and\nconditions.\nIn June 2007, we entered into a sublease for 1,000 square feet (as later adjusted to 3,100 square feet) of excess\noffice space at our Atlanta headquarters with HBR Capital, Ltd. (\"HBR\"), a company co-owned by David G. Hanna and his\nbrother Frank J. Hanna, III. The sublease rate per square foot is the same as the rate that we pay under the prime lease.\nUnder the sublease, HBR paid us $95,653 and $62,422 for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The aggregate amount of payments\nrequired under the sublease from January 1, 2024 to the expiration of the sublease in May 2024 is $40,184.\nIn January 2013, HBR began leasing the services of certain employees from us. HBR reimburses us for the full\ncost of the employees, based on the amount of time devoted to HBR. In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we\nreceived $605,374 and $404,302, respectively, of reimbursed costs from HBR associated with these leased employees.\nOn November 26, 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Dove.\nThe agreement provided for a senior secured term loan facility in an amount of up to $40.0 million at any time outstanding.\nOn December 27, 2019, the Company issued 400,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial\nliquidation preference of $40.0 million, in exchange for full satisfaction of the $40.0 million that the Company owed Dove\nunder the Loan and Security Agreement. Dove is a limited liability company owned by three trusts. David G. Hanna is the\nsole shareholder and the President of the corporation that serves as the sole trustee of one of the trusts, and David G.
