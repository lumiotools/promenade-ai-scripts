As I noted last year, there has never been a\nmore exciting time for J&J Snack Foods.\nOur 2023 results underscore tremendous progress across the\norganization thanks to the dedicated efforts of our employees and the\npositive impact of strategic initiatives undertaken in the last two years. As\nwe build leadership across core departments and categories, expand\nmanufacturing capabilities, optimize distribution, and foster a winning\ncompany culture, we are experiencing a new level of momentum that can\nbe felt throughout the organization.\n(cid:46)(cid:61)(cid:75)(cid:77)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:75)(cid:3) NET SALES (000)’s $ $1,558,829\nOPERATING INCOME (000)’s $ 109,518\n(cid:65)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:30)(cid:74)(cid:65)(cid:61)(cid:62)(cid:3)\nEARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE $ 4.08\nOur 2023 top line results marked the third consecutive year of double-digit net sales growth up 12.9% for the year, reflecting $178\nmillion in incremental sales. These results were driven by continued growth across all three of our business segments, highlighting\nthe health of our business and consumer appeal of our products and brands. I am incredibly pleased with the success of our work to\nimprove margins and drive profitability. Gross margin improved to 30.1% for the year as we continued to improve operating\nefficiencies and reduce distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue. This led to operating income increasing by 77.2% for the\nfull year.\n*Looking ahead to 2024, our company has never been more aligned in its vision and strategy. We continue to be guided by 5 core\nstrategies: Grow and Protect Our Brands, Dominate Core Categories, Cross-Sell the Portfolio, Invest in Our Future, and Embrace our\nCulture. We are collaborating better than ever and finding new sales opportunities across our portfolio. Our strategy continues to\nsupport our financial goals of growing sales faster than the market, creating expense leverage, and growing profits faster than sales.\nAs we evaluate future growth opportunities, we remain highly disciplined in seeking acquisitions and partnerships that complement\nour brand portfolio and business model, and that offer attractive shareholder returns. Financially, we have the resources and balance\nsheet to invest in growth as opportunities align.\nIn summary, we are building a winning culture, our business is strong, and we are aligned on core strategies that position us for\ncontinued success in fiscal 2024 and beyond. The diverse nature of our product portfolio combined with the power of our brands and\naffordability of our price points will continue to serve us well as we move forward. And our focus on cross selling the portfolio will\ncontinue to open new product opportunities and channels. I am so proud of our J&J employees and their relentless focus on satisfying\nthe consumer and want to thank them for their efforts in delivering a record 2023 year.\nSincerely,\n*This annual report contains forward-looking statements that are based on numerous Dan Fachner\nassumptions about future events and conditions which may prove to be inaccurate.\nSee “Forward – Looking Statements” on page 1 of this annual report.

These\nsegments are described below.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker for Food Service, Retail Supermarkets and Frozen Beverages reviews detailed\noperating income statements and sales reports in order to assess performance and allocate resources to each individual\nsegment. Sales and operating income are key variables monitored by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and management\nwhen determining each segment’s and the Company’s financial condition and operating performance. In addition, the Chief\nOperating Decision Maker reviews and evaluates depreciation, capital spending and assets of each segment on a quarterly\nbasis to monitor cash flow and asset needs of each segment (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial\ninformation about segments).\nFood Service\nThe primary products sold by the Food Service segment are soft pretzels, frozen novelties, churros, handheld products and\nbaked goods.

Soft pretzel sales amounted to 19% of the\nCompany’s revenue in fiscal year 2023, 19% in fiscal year 2022, and 20% in fiscal year 2021.\n2\nCertain of the Company’s soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes\nof the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling a participating school to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of\nthe Company’s soft pretzels from the USDA.\nThe Company’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. Soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to\ntwenty-four ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by the Company’s twister machines. These soft pretzel tying\nmachines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, we make\nsoft pretzels which are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily quick-frozen in either raw\nor baked form and packaged for delivery.\nThe Company’s principal marketing program in the Food Service segment includes supplying ovens, mobile\nmerchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale\nof soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that rebake frozen\nsoft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven. The Company retains ownership of the\nequipment placed in customer locations, and as a result, customers are not required to make an investment in equipment.\nFrozen Novelties\nThe Company’s frozen novelties are marketed primarily under the DIPPIN’DOTS, LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT,\nDOGSTERS, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names.

Handheld products are sold to the Food\nService and Retail Supermarket segments. Handheld product sales amounted to 6% of the Company’s sales in fiscal year\n2023 and 7% in both fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nBakery Products\nThe Company’s bakery products are marketed under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRY HOME,\nMARY B’S, DADDY RAY’S and HILL & VALLEY brand names, and under private labels.

The primary products sold to the retail supermarket channel are soft pretzels, frozen novelties and handheld\nproducts.\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for\n43%, 43% and 43% of our sales during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with our largest customer\naccounting for 9% of our sales in fiscal 2023, 8% of our sales in fiscal 2022 and 11% of our sales in fiscal 2021. Five of the\nten customers in 2023 are food distributors who sell our product to many end users. The loss of one or more of our large\ncustomers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts\nand make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service\nperformance. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business. If\nreceivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our operating income would be adversely impacted.\nThe Food Service and the Frozen Beverages segments sell primarily to foodservice channels. The Retail Supermarkets\nsegment sells primarily to the retail supermarket channel.\nThe Company’s customers in the Food Service segment include snack bars and food stands in chain, department and mass\nmerchandising stores, malls and shopping centers, fast food and casual dining restaurants, stadiums and sports arenas,\nleisure and theme parks, convenience stores, movie theatres, warehouse club stores, schools, colleges and other institutions,\nand independent retailers. Machines and machine parts are sold to other food and beverage companies. Within the food\nservice industry, the Company’s products are purchased by the consumer primarily for consumption at the point-of-sale.\nThe Company sells its products to an estimated 85-90% of supermarkets in the United States. Products sold to retail\nsupermarket customers are primarily soft pretzel products, including SUPERPRETZEL and AUNTIE ANNE’S, frozen\nnovelties including LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice, MINUTE MAID Juice Bars and Soft Frozen Lemonade, WHOLE FRUIT\nfrozen fruit bars, WHOLE FRUIT Sorbet, PHILLY SWIRL cups and sticks, MARY B’S biscuits and dumplings, DADDY\nRAY’S fig and fruit bars, HILL & VALLEY baked goods, and ICEE Squeeze-Up Tubes. Within the retail supermarket\nindustry, the Company’s frozen and prepackaged products are purchased by the consumer for consumption at home.\nMarketing and Distribution\nThe Company supports its portfolio of brands with national and regional marketing programs. For the Food Service and\nFrozen Beverages segments’ customers, these marketing programs includes providing ovens, mobile merchandisers,\ndisplay cases, freezers, kiosks, warmers, frozen beverage dispensers and other merchandising equipment for the individual\ncustomer’s requirements and point-of-sale materials as well as participating in trade shows and in-store demonstrations.\nThe Company’s ongoing advertising and promotional campaigns for its Retail Supermarket segment’s products include\nconsumer advertising campaigns across traditional and digital channels, and print/digital media with value added shopper\noffers and promotions.\nThe Company develops and introduces new products on a routine basis. The Company evaluates the success of new\nproduct introductions on the basis of sales and profit levels.\nThe Company’s products are sold through a network of food brokers, independent sales distributors and the Company’s\nown direct sales force. For its snack food products, the Company maintains warehouse and distribution facilities in\nPennsauken, Bellmawr and Bridgeport, New Jersey; Vernon (Los Angeles), Colton and Lancaster, California; Brooklyn,\nNew York; Scranton and Hatfield, Pennsylvania; Carrollton (Dallas) and Terrell, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Moscow Mills\n(St. Louis), Missouri; Pensacola and Tampa, Florida; Solon, Ohio; Weston, Oregon; Holly Ridge, North Carolina; Rock\nIsland, Illinois; and Paducah, Kentucky. Frozen beverages and machine parts are distributed from 170 Company managed\nwarehouse and distribution facilities located in 44 states, Mexico and Canada, which allow the Company to directly service\nits customers in the surrounding areas. The Company’s products are shipped in frozen and other vehicles from the\nCompany’s manufacturing and warehouse facilities on a fleet of Company operated tractor-trailers, trucks and vans, as well\nas by independent carriers.\n5\nSeasonality\nThe Company’s sales are seasonal because frozen beverage sales and frozen novelties sales are generally higher during the\nwarmer months.\nTrademarks and Patents\nThe Company has a significant trademark portfolio, the most important of which are SUPERPRETZEL, TEXAS TWIST,\nNEW YORK PRETZEL, BAVARIAN BAKERY, SOFTSTIX and BRAUHAUS for its pretzel products; DIPPIN’ DOTS,\nSHAPE-UPS, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL and LUIGI’S for its frozen novelties; ¡HOLA!, and CALIFORNIA\nCHURROS for its churros; ICEE, ARCTIC BLAST, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE for its frozen beverages;\nFUNNEL CAKE FACTORY for its funnel cake products, and MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRY\nHOME, CAMDEN CREEK, MARY B’S, DADDY RAY’S and HILL & VALLEY for its bakery products.\nThe Company markets frozen beverages under the trademark ICEE in all of the United States and in Mexico and Canada.\nAdditionally, the Company has the international rights to the trademark ICEE.\nThe trademarks, when renewed and continuously used, have an indefinite term and are considered important to the\nCompany as a means of identifying its products. The Company considers its trademarks important to the success of its\nbusiness.\nThe Company has numerous patents related to the manufacturing and marketing of its products.\nSuppliers\nThe Company’s manufactured products are produced from raw materials which are readily available from numerous\nsources. With the exception of the Company’s churro production equipment, funnel cake production equipment and soft\npretzel twisting equipment, all of which are made for the Company by independent third parties, and certain specialized\npackaging equipment, the Company’s manufacturing equipment is readily available from various sources. Syrup for frozen\nbeverages is purchased primarily from The Coca-Cola Company, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Inc., the Pepsi Cola Company, and\nJogue, Inc. Cups. Straws and lids are readily available from various suppliers. Parts for frozen beverage dispensing\nmachines are purchased from several sources.\nCompetition\nSnack food and bakery products markets are highly competitive. The Company’s principal products compete against\nsimilar and different food products manufactured and sold by numerous other companies, some of which are substantially\nlarger and have greater resources than the Company. As the soft pretzel, frozen novelties, bakery products and related\nmarkets evolve, additional competitors and new competing products may enter the markets. Competitive factors in these\nmarkets include product quality, customer service, taste, price, identity and brand name awareness, method of distribution\nand sales promotions.\n6\nThe Company believes it is the only national distributor of soft pretzels. However, there are numerous regional and local\nmanufacturers of food service and retail supermarket soft pretzels as well as several chains of retail pretzel stores.\nIn Frozen Beverages, the Company competes directly with other frozen beverage companies. There are many other regional\nfrozen beverage competitors throughout the country and one large retail chain which uses its own frozen beverage brand.\nThe Company competes with large soft drink manufacturers for counter and floor space for its frozen beverage dispensing\nmachines at retail locations and with products which are more widely known than the ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and\nPARROT ICE frozen beverages.\nThe Company competes with several other companies in the frozen novelties and bakery products markets.\nRisks Associated with Foreign Operations\nForeign operations can involve greater risk than doing business in the United States. Foreign economies differ favorably or\nunfavorably from the United States’ economy in such respects as the level of inflation and debt, which may result in\nfluctuations in the value of the country’s currency and real property. Sales of our foreign operations were $70.2 million,\n$45.2 million and $20.8 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2023, the total assets\nof our foreign operations were $61.5 million or 4.8% of total assets. At September 24, 2022, the total assets of our foreign\noperations were $42.7 million or 3.5% of total assets.\nGovernment Regulation and Food Safety\nOur business operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a\nproducer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality,\nlabeling and distribution standards, including regulations promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and\nthe Food Safety Modernization Act. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws.\nBased upon available information, the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect\nupon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal 2023 and is not expected to have a material\nimpact in fiscal 2024.\nOur Food Safety & Quality (FSQA) personnel within our Compliance Department have broad, diverse academic and\nexperience credentials and oversee all aspects of product safety & quality control across the Company. Our facilities are\nGlobal Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified and are audited annually by third-party certification bodies. Our “Food\nSafety & Quality Plans” are validated and verified to ensure product safety and quality. We have implemented Corporate\nStandards which are aligned with GFSI and Regulatory standards and routinely conduct audits to ensure compliance. We\nprovide bi-weekly support calls for FSQA and Plant Leadership and annual Food Safety Summit Meetings to develop and\nstrengthen our facility teams. As part of the onboarding process, and throughout their careers, employees are engaged in\nfood safety discussions and trainings to provide safe, high-quality products to customers and consumers.\nHuman Capital Management\nEmployees and Labor Relations\nThe Company has approximately 5,000 full and part-time employees and approximately 800 workers employed by staffing\nagencies as of September 30, 2023. About 1,400 production and distribution employees throughout the Company are\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its culture and employee relations to be positive.\n7\nEmployee Safety\nWe maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We have a\nteam of dedicated Employee Health & Safety professionals within our Compliance Department who oversee all aspects of\nemployee safety across the company. We keep our employees safe by ensuring all employees receive ongoing support and\ntraining. We have developed and implemented processes to identify and eliminate safety incidents by reducing their\nfrequency and severity. We also closely review and monitor our safety performance. According to data from the U.S\nBureau of Labor Statistics, the Company’s Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and Days Away, Restricted or\nTransferred (“DART”) incident rates were lower than food manufacturing averages. Our goal is to reduce Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recordable incidents year over year.\nProfessional Development\nWe deploy a variety of training programs throughout the organization and go to great lengths to make learning and\nknowledge available to our employees. Programs such as tuition reimbursement, mentorships, internships and internal\ntrainings are some of the ways in which we invest in our people and their knowledge. We know that these investments are\nnot only beneficial for our employees, but they are also important for the future success of our business. We continue to see\nincreases in internal promotions across all levels of the organization.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that having an inclusive and diverse culture strengthens our ability to recruit and develop talent and allows our\nemployees to thrive and succeed. Diversity of input and perspectives is an essential part of our strategic plan to build a\nwinning team and culture. We believe that one key to success is attracting and retaining a diverse workforce that reflects\nour consumers of today and tomorrow, and we strive to do so. We also strive to foster an inclusive and diverse workplace\nculture where colleagues feel a sense of belonging, and are included in discussions and valued for their contributions.\nCompensation\nWe believe in equal pay for equal work and that compensation should match talent, experience and skill set of a person.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s internet address is www.jjsnack.com.

Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks described below,\ntogether with all the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and\nuncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us\nor that we currently deem insignificant or immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or prospects. The following is a discussion of known potentially significant risks which\ncould result in harm to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks of Shortages or Increased Cost of Raw Materials\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials\nand energy. The raw materials and energy which we use for the production and distribution of our products are largely\ncommodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by changes in global supply and\ndemand, weather conditions, agricultural uncertainty or governmental controls. We purchase these materials and energy\nmainly in the open market. Our procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may\npotentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. If commodity price changes result in increases in raw\nmaterials and energy costs, we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering\nreduced revenue and operating income.\nGeneral Economic Risk\nThe willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions.\nWorsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer\ndemand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause\nconsumers to forego certain purchases during economic downturns that could result in decreased demand for our business.\nThe economic uncertainty may limit our ability to increase or maintain prices and reduce sales of higher margin products.\nIn addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, efforts to combat inflation, financial and credit market\ndisruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us.\nRisks Relating to Pandemics, Epidemics, or Other Disease Outbreaks\nPandemics, epidemics, or other disease outbreaks could significantly change consumption patterns for our products. These\nchanges could force us to rapidly adapt to those new patterns, and, if we do not, our business could be materially and\nadversely affected. Additionally, pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks may depress or otherwise impact demand\nfor our products because quarantines may inhibit consumption or as the result of other factors. Restrictions on public\ngatherings or interactions may also limit the opportunity for our customers and consumers to purchase our products,\nespecially in certain of our sales channels, such as food service. Any economc downturn caused by any pandemic,\nepidemic, or other disease outbreak may also cause substantial changes in consumer behavior and our supply chain\noperations, some of which may materially affect our operations and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks of the Food Industry\nWe are subject to the risks of adverse changes in general economic conditions; evolving consumer preferences and\nnutritional and health-related concerns; changes in food distribution channels; federal, state and local food processing\ncontrols or other mandates; changes in federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, or in the application of\nsuch laws and regulations; consumer product liability claims; risks of product tampering and contamination; and negative\npublicity surrounding actual or perceived product safety deficiencies. The increased buying power of large supermarket\nchains, other retail outlets and wholesale food vendors could result in greater resistance to price increases and could alter\ncustomer inventory levels and access to shelf space.\nRisks of Shortages or Increased Costs of Labor\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The labor market in the United States is very competitive. We\ndepend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of employees, including our experienced management\nteam. We must hire, train and develop effective employees. We compete with other companies both within and outside of\nour industry for talented employees, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train, and retain other talented\npersonnel. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, and retain\nqualified individuals. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating\nresults. Additionally, a shortage in the labor pool and other general inflationary pressures or changes, and applicable laws\n9\nand regulations could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results\nor financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other associates may seek to be\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we\nare unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are\nunable to otherwise manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which could impair manufacturing or distribution of\nour products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase\nour costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or adapt to\nchanging business needs or strategy.\nEnvironmental Risks\nThe disposal of solid and liquid waste material and the discharge of airborne pollutants resulting from the preparation and\nprocessing of foods is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the\nenvironment. Such laws and regulations have an important effect on the food processing industry as a whole, requiring\nsubstantially all firms in the industry to incur material expenditures for modification of existing processing facilities and for\nconstruction of upgraded or new waste treatment facilities.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws\nor regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Enactment of\nmore stringent laws or regulations or more strict interpretation of existing laws and regulations may require additional\nexpenditure by us, some of which could have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Additionally, the\nfailure by any one or more of our suppliers to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating\nto the protection of the environment, or allegations of non-compliance, may disrupt their operations and could result in\naccompanying disruptions to our operations.\nRisks Resulting from Customer Concentration\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for\n43% of our sales during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with our largest customer accounting for 9% of our\nsales in 2023, 8% of our sales in 2022 and 11% of our sales in 2021.\nFive of the ten customers are food distributors who sell our product to many end users. The loss of one or more of our large\ncustomers could adversely affect our results of operations. These customers typically do not enter into long-term contracts\nand make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service\nperformance. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business. If\nreceivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our operating income would be adversely impacted.\nRisks Relating to Competition\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete against national and regional manufacturers and\ndistributors on the basis of price, quality, product variety, brand recognition and loyalty, and effective distribution. Many of\nour major competitors in the market are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Increased\ncompetition from our competitors could lead to downward pressure on prices and/or a decline in our market share, either of\nwhich could adversely affect our results. See “Competition” in Item 1 for more information about our competitors.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing and Distribution\nOur ability to purchase, manufacture and distribute products is critical to our success. Because we source certain products\nfrom single manufacturing sites, it is possible that we could experience a production disruption that results in a reduction or\nelimination of the availability of some of our products. If we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a\ntimely manner, or on favorable terms, it could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows, including the potential for long-term loss of product placement with various customers. We are\nalso subject to risks of other business disruptions associated with our dependence on production facilities and distribution\nsystems. Natural disasters, terrorist activity, cyberattacks or other unforeseen events could interrupt production or\ndistribution and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,\nincluding the potential for long-term loss of product placement with our customers.\n10\nRisks Relating to the Availability and Costs of Transportation\nOur ability to obtain adequate and reasonably priced methods of transportation to distribute our products, including\nrefrigerated trailers for many of our products, is a key factor to our success. Delays in transportation, including weather-\nrelated delays, and carrier capacity limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations. Further, higher fuel costs and increased line haul costs due to industry capacity constraints, customer delivery\nrequirements and a more restrictive regulatory environment could also negatively impact our financial results. We pay fuel\nsurcharges that fluctuate with the price of diesel fuel to third-party transporters of our products, and such surcharges can be\nsubstantial. Any sudden or dramatic increases in the price of diesel fuel would serve to increase our fuel surcharges and our\ncost of goods sold. These higher costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing Capacity Constraints\nOur current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of our products.\nOur ability to increase our manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the costs and availability of\nequipment, the equipment delivery and construction lead-times, installation, qualification, regulatory permitting and\nregulatory requirements. A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause our customer service\nlevels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally, which\nin turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In\naddition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively affect\nrelations with our employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions in our operations.\nRisks Relating to Acquisition Integration\nFrom time to time, the Company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture\ndepends on the Company’s ability to identify opportunities that help the Company meet its strategic objectives,\nconsummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.\nAcquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which\ninvolves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:\n-- integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses;\n-- the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired\nbusinesses;\n-- attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;\n-- creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs\nassociated with such matters; and\n-- expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and\nbrands.\nDivestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and\noperational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and\nfinancial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIn situations where acquisitions and divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of\nsuch acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the Company’s business or financial results could be negatively\nimpacted.\nNew Jersey Law and Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws May Inhibit a\nChange In Control\nThe New Jersey Shareholders' Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 14A:10A-1, et seq., may delay, deter or prevent a change in control\nby prohibiting the Company from engaging in a business combination transaction with an interested shareholder for a\nperiod of five years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a majority of our shareholders believe a\nchange in control would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In addition, our Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a future acquisition of\nJ & J Snack Foods Corp. not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an\nattractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in\n11\ntheir best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and\nobtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions of our Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that could delay, deter or prevent a future acquisition include the following:\n-- a classified Board of Directors;\n-- the requirement that our shareholders may only remove Directors for cause;\n-- limitations on share holdings and voting of certain persons who exceed the “Voting Threshold” specified in the\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;\n-- special Director voting rights are granted to certain “Experienced Directors” only in the event of a “hostile change\nof Board control,” as such terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;\n-- the ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, creditors and the local communities in which we operate;\n-- shareholders do not generally have the right to call special meetings or to act by written consent;\n-- our Bylaws contain advance notice procedures for nominations of Directors or submission of shareholder\nproposals at an annual meeting; and\n-- our Bylaws contain a forum selection clause providing that certain litigation against the Company can only be\nbrought in New Jersey state or federal courts.\nRisks Relating to Gerald B. Shreiber\nGerald B. Shreiber is the founder and a Director of the Company. He is currently beneficial owner of approximately 20% of\nits outstanding common stock, held in a trust for his benefit. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nprovides Mr. Shreiber with certain special voting rights with respect to any matters to be voted on by the Board of\nDirectors. As a result, as of the date of this Report, Mr. Shreiber is entitled to cast six (6) votes on all matters upon which\nthe Board of Directors is entitled to vote.\nRisk Related to Increases in our Health Insurance Costs\nThe costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative\nchanges, and general economic conditions. Because of the breadth and complexity of health care regulations as well as\nother health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislatures, we cannot predict with certainty the\nfuture effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of new or\nexisting health care reform laws or changes in enforcement policies could have a negative impact on our financial position\nand results of operations.\nRisk Related to Product Changes\nThere are risks in the marketplace related to trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, packing initiatives\nand new product introductions. We cannot be sure if our new products, product improvements, or packaging initiatives will\nbe accepted by customers.\nRisks Associated with Foreign Operations\nForeign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States’ economy in such respects as the level of\ninflation and debt, which may result in fluctuations in the value of the country’s currency. Further, there may be less\ngovernment regulation in various countries, and we may face difficulty in enforcing our legal rights outside the United\nStates. Additionally, in some foreign countries, there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitations\non the removal of property or other assets, political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could affect the\noperations and assets of U.S. companies doing business in that country. Any such difficulties noted above could affect our\nbusiness. Sales of our foreign operations were $70.2 million, $45.2 million and $20.8 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. At September 30, 2023, the total assets of our foreign operations were approximately $61.5 million or\n4.8% of total assets. At September 24, 2022, the total assets of our foreign operations were $42.7 million or 3.5% of total\nassets.\n12\nRisks Associated with our Information Technology Systems\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information\ntechnology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, manufacturing, order entry and\nfulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us\nby third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in production, billing, collecting,\nand ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of\noperations to suffer.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control,\nincluding fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including those against our third-party\nproviders and theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. Although we continue to monitor our\ninformation technology networks, if we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other\ninformation security breaches, we may suffer material financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur\nsignificant remediation costs or penalties.\nRisks Associated with Real or Perceived Safety Issues Regarding our Food Products\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product\ntampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We can be impacted by both real and\nunfounded claims regarding the safety of our operations, or concerns regarding mislabeled, adulterated, contaminated or\nspoiled food products. Any of these circumstances could necessitate a voluntary or mandatory recall due to a substantial\nproduct hazard, a need to change a product’s labeling or other consumer safety concerns. A pervasive product recall may\nresult in significant loss due to the costs of a recall, related legal claims, including claims arising from bodily injury or\nillness caused by our products, the destruction of product inventory, or lost sales due to product unavailability or negative\npublicity. A highly publicized product recall, whether involving us or any related products made by third parties, also could\nresult in a loss of customers or an unfavorable change in consumer sentiment regarding our products or any category in\nwhich we operate. In addition, an allegation of noncompliance with federal or state food laws and regulations could force us\nto cease production, stop selling our products or create significant adverse publicity that could harm our credibility and\ndecrease market acceptance of our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Associated with our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our\nbusiness. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret\nprotection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property in traditional retail and\ndigital environments. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens\nor removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect\nour business and financial results.\nCompeting intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or\ndisputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time consuming and may divert the attention of our management\nand key personnel from our business operations. We may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against\ndevelopment, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.\nRisks Associated with the Favorable Perception of our Brands\nWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands\nis critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and\nenhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish\nsignificantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner,\nadverse publicity about our products, packaging, ingredients, our environmental, social, human capital or governance\npractices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive\nconsumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by\nconsumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about\nus, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In\naddition, we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently\nin maintaining our brand image. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be\nadversely impacted.\n13\nRisk Associated with Generating Anticipated Cost Savings and/or Operating Efficiencies Associated with our Strategic\nInitiatives\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate\nefficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs. We continuously\npursue initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. We also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives in\nprocurement, manufacturing and logistics. Any failure or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans\ncould adversely affect our ability to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our\nbusiness. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and\nprofitability could decrease.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur sales are affected by the seasonal demand for our products. Demand is greater during the summer months primarily as\na result of the warm weather demand for our ICEE and frozen novelties products. Because of seasonal fluctuations, there\ncan be no assurance that the results of any particular quarter will be indicative of results for the full year or for future years.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nWe have no unresolved SEC staff comments to report.\nItem 2.

The Company’s retail supermarket customers\nare primarily supermarket chains.\nBusiness Trends\nCOVID-19\nDating back to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, the effects of COVID-19 on consumer behavior have\nimpacted the relevant demand for our Food Service, Retail, and Frozen Beverage segments. In fiscal 2020, we saw a shift in\ndemand towards increased at-home food consumption, which benefited our Retail segment, and away from in-restaurant\ndining, and experience driven activities, which negatively impacted our Food Service and Frozen Beverage segments. This\nshift in demand proved inconsistent and volatile over the course of the pandemic. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as part of\nthe pandemic economy that impacted our operations opened, sales in our Food Service and Frozen Beverages segments\nimproved.\nThe aforementioned shift, and overall volatility in demand, has had a significant impact on the operating results of each of\nour three segments over the past three fiscal years. Additional impacts from the pandemic have caused us to experience\nhigher hourly wage rates paid to our front-line employees, increased costs for personal protective equipment, increased\ncomplexity and uncertainty around production planning and forecasting, and overall lower levels of efficiency in our\nproduction and distribution network, all of which has unfavorably impacted our operating results. In fiscal 2023, our\noperating environment became more predictable and stable, and the majority of the volatility and shifts in demand that had\nbeen more present in fiscal 2021 and 2022, somewhat subsided.\nInflation\nWe continued to experience cost inflation through fiscal 2023, although the impact was significantly less than it had been in\nfiscal 2022, primarily tied to a smaller group of raw materials and packaging, and materially offset by the benefit of the\npricing actions that had been taken in fiscal 2022. The inflationary cost environment we experienced during fiscal 2022\nresulted in significantly higher input costs for our business. During fiscal 2022, we experienced unprecedented inflationary\npressures on commodities such as flour, oils, eggs, meats and dairy, in addition to notably higher costs for packaging,\nfreight and warehousing, and labor. To help offset these cost headwinds, we implemented a series of pricing actions\nthroughout fiscal 2022.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53- week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\nincluded in the last fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters,\nwhich occurred in the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks,\nwhereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each.\n17\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS:\nFiscal Year 2023 (53 weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2022 (52 weeks)\nResults of Consolidated Operations\nThe following discussion provides a review of results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared with the\nfiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nSummary of Results Fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales $ 1,558,829 $ 1,380,656 12.9%\nCost of goods sold 1,088,964 1,011,014 7.7%\nGross Profit 469,865 369,642 27.1%\nOperating expenses\nMarketing 110,258 91,636 20.3%\nDistribution 172,804 159,637 8.2%\nAdministrative 75,425 55,189 36.7%\nIntangible asset impairment charges 1,678 1,010\nOther general expense 182 371 (50.9)%\nTotal Operating Expenses 360,347 307,843 17.1%\nOperating Income 109,518 61,799 77.2%\nOther income (expense)\nInvestment income 2,743 980 179.9%\nInterest expense (4,747) (1,025 ) 363.1%\nEarnings before income taxes 107,514 61,754 74.1%\nIncome tax expense 28,608 14,519 97.0%\nNET EARNINGS $ 78,906 $ 47,235 67.0%\nComparisons as a Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022 Basis Pt Chg\nGross profit 30.1 % 26.8% 330\nMarketing 7.1 % 6.6% 50\nDistribution 11.1 % 11.6% (50 )\nAdministrative 4.8 % 4.0% 80\nOperating income 7.0 % 4.5% 250\nEarnings before income taxes 6.9 % 4.5% 240\nNet earnings 5.1 % 3.4% 170\n18\nNET SALES\nNet sales increased by $178.2 million, or 13%, to $1,558.8 million in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2023 net sales include $96.0\nmillion of net sales from Dippin’ Dots, an increase of $62.2 million from prior fiscal year with the increase primarily\nattributable to the timing of the acquisition in prior year results. Organic sales growth was driven by growth across all three\nof the Company’s business segments, led by our core products including soft pretzels, churros, frozen novelties and frozen\nbeverages. The organic sales growth was largely driven by improved marketing, new customers, additional product\nplacement, as well as the benefit of our pricing actions that had been taken throughout fiscal 2022. To a lesser extent, fiscal\n2023 net sales were benefited by the extra week in the fiscal year.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit increased by $100.2 million, or 27%, to $469.9 million in fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales\nincreased to 30.1% in fiscal 2023 from 26.8% in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was\ndriven by enhanced production efficiencies and the benefit of our fiscal 2022 pricing actions and a better product mix,\nalong with the stabilization of inflationary pressures on the back of historic highs in fiscal 2022. The cost of key ingredients\nincluding flour, oils, dairy and meats either declined, or remained materially flat, though double-digit increases were seen in\nsugar/sweeteners and mixes, which continued to negatively impact margins on certain products including frozen novelties\nand churros.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nTotal operating expenses increased by $52.5 million, or 17%, to $360.3 million in fiscal 2023 and increased as a percentage\nof sales to 23.1% in fiscal 2023 compared with 22.3% in fiscal 2022. The increase reflects the impact of inflationary\npressures across the majority of our cost line items including industry-wide freight and distribution cost increases and wage\nincreases that more heavily impacted the Company’s comparative results in the first and second fiscal quarters, offset\nsomewhat by the benefits seen from our strategic initiatives to improve logistics management and increase efficiency across\nour distribution network and supply chain. The increase also reflects the full year impact of a higher expense Dippin’ Dots\nbusiness in fiscal 2023 results.\nOperating expenses included intangible asset impairment charges of $1.7 million in fiscal 2023 and $1.0 million in fiscal\n2022. As a percentage of sales, marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 6.6% in fiscal 2022\nto 7.1% in fiscal 2023, with the increase driven by the additional investment in marketing spend associated with new\nproduct launches and the promotion of our core brands. Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.1%\nin fiscal 2023 from 11.6% in fiscal 2022, with the decrease driven by the benefits of our strategic initiatives to improve\nlogistics management and increase efficiency across our distribution network and supply chain. Administrative expenses as\na percentage of sales increased from 4.0% in fiscal 2022 to 4.8% in fiscal 2023, with the increase largely attributable to\nhigher performance-based bonus payments and continued investments in capability.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nInvestment income increased by $1.8 million, or 180%, to $2.7 million in fiscal 2023 due to the improving interest rate\nenvironment in fiscal 2023.\nInterest expense increased by $3.7 million, or 363%, to $4.7 million in fiscal 2023 due to the Company’s outstanding\nborrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 26.6%. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 year was 23.5%.\nNET EARNINGS\nNet earnings increased $31.7 million, or 67%, in fiscal 2023 to $78.9 million, or $4.08 per diluted share, from $47.2 million\nor $2.46 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022 as a result of the aforementioned items.\nThere are many factors which can impact our net earnings from year to year, among which are the supply and cost of raw\nmaterials and labor, insurance costs, factors impacting sales as noted above, the continuing consolidation of our customers,\nour ability to manage our manufacturing, marketing and distribution activities, our ability to make and integrate\nacquisitions and changes in tax laws and interest rates.\n19\nResults of Operations - Segments\nWe have three reportable segments, as disclosed in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements: Food\nService, Retail Supermarkets and Frozen Beverages.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker for Food Service, Retail Supermarkets and Frozen Beverages reviews monthly\ndetailed operating income statements and sales reports in order to assess performance and allocate resources to each\nindividual segment. Sales and operating income are the key variables monitored by the Chief Operating Decision Maker\nand management when determining each segment’s and the Company’s financial condition and operating performance. In\naddition, the Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews and evaluates depreciation, capital spending and assets of each\nsegment on a quarterly basis to monitor cash flow and asset needs of each segment.\nThe following table is a summary of sales and operating income, which is how we measure segment profit.\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales\nFood Service $ 981,840 $ 872,687 12.5%\nRetail Supermarket 215,428 197,943 8.8%\nFrozen Beverages 361,561 310,026 16.6%\nTotal Sales $ 1,558,829 $ 1,380,656 12.9%\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating Income\nFood Service $ 49,778 $ 18,512 168.9%\nRetail Supermarket 9,375 9,487 (1.2)%\nFrozen Beverages 50,365 33,800 49.0%\nTotal Operating Income $ 109,518 $ 61,799 77.2%\nFOOD SERVICE SEGMENT RESULTS\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nFood Service Sales to External Customers\nSoft pretzels $ 235,572 $ 205,752 14.5%\nFrozen novelties 145,425 78,183 86.0%\nChurros 108,927 88,242 23.4%\nHandhelds 82,292 92,130 (10.7)%\nBakery 378,149 381,526 (0.9)%\nOther 31,475 26,854 17.2%\nTotal Food Service $ 981,840 $ 872,687 12.5%\nFood Service Operating Income $ 49,778 $ 18,512 168.9%\nSales to food service customers increased $109.2 million, or 13%, to $981.8 million in fiscal 2023, which included an\nincrease of $62.2 million in sales from Dippin’ Dots. Soft pretzel sales to the food service market increased 14% to $235.6\nmillion for the year, led by the continued increase in sales of our core pretzel products. Frozen novelties sales increased\n$67.2 million, or 86%, to $145.4 million for the year, with the increase largely driven by incremental Dippin’ Dots sales\nduring fiscal 2023. Churro sales to food service customers were up 23% to $108.9 million for the year led by customer\nexpansion and growing menu penetration. Sales of bakery products decreased $3.4 million, or 1%, to $378.1 million for the\nyear, with the decrease attributable to the rationalization of certain lower margin Stock Keeping Units (“SKU”)’s. Handheld\n20\nsales to food service customers decreased 11% to $82.3 million in fiscal 2023, with the decrease largely attributable to\npricing declines related to the contractual pricing true-up of costing on certain raw material ingredients, as well as some\nvolume declines amongst certain customers in the product category. Sales of funnel cake increased $4.6 million, or 17%, to\n$31.5 million.\nSales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction were approximately $0.3 million for the fiscal\nyear. The benefit of the wrap of prior year price increases favorably impacted sales in the fiscal year, and more than offset\nsome volume declines seen in certain product categories.\nOperating income in our Food Service segment increased from $18.5 million in fiscal 2022 to $49.8 million in fiscal 2023,\nlargely driven by the benefit seen from the incremental Dippin’ Dots sales, as well as by improved gross margin\nperformance and improving distribution expenses.\nRETAIL SUPERMARKETS SEGMENT RESULTS\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nRetail Supermarket Sales to External Customers\nSoft pretzels $ 60,272 $ 61,925 (2.7)%\nFrozen novelties 115,807 108,911 6.3%\nBiscuits 25,074 24,695 1.5%\nHandhelds 16,655 5,640 195.3%\nCoupon redemption (2,561) (3,713 ) (31.0)%\nOther 181 485 (62.7)%\nTotal Retail Supermarket $ 215,428 $ 197,943 8.8%\nRetail Supermarket Operating Income $ 9,375 $ 9,487 (1.2)%\nSales of products to retail supermarkets increased $17.5 million, or 9%, to $215.4 million in fiscal year 2023. Soft pretzel\nsales to retail supermarkets were $60.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 3%, from sales in fiscal 2022. Soft pretzel\nsales to retail supermarkets were impacted by a softer consumer environment as retailers and grocery chains reported lower\ntraffic in stores and smaller baskets at certain points during fiscal 2023. Sales of frozen novelties increased $6.9 million, or\n6%, to $115.8 million in fiscal 2023. Sales of biscuits and dumplings increased 2% to $25.1 million in fiscal 2023.\nHandheld sales to retail supermarket customers increased 195% to $16.7 million in fiscal 2023, with the increase largely\ndriven by expansion with a major retailer.\nSales of new products in the first twelve months since their introduction in retail supermarkets were approximately $0.6\nmillion in fiscal 2023. Operating income in our Retail Supermarkets segment remained relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as\ncompared with fiscal 2022, with a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%. The relatively comparative flat operating income was\nthe result of gross margin challenges earlier in fiscal 2023 due to higher promotions and allowances, as well as inflationary\npressures on raw material costs, offset by stronger comparative performance in the fiscal third and fourth quarters of 2023,\nlargely driven by improved gross margin and lower distribution expenses.\nFROZEN BEVERAGES SEGMENT RESULTS\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(53 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nFrozen Beverages\nBeverages $ 224,655 $ 184,063 22.1%\nRepair and maintenance service 95,941 89,840 6.8%\nMachines revenue 37,933 33,601 12.9%\nOther 3,032 2,522 20.2%\nTotal Frozen Beverages $ 361,561 $ 310,026 16.6%\nFrozen Beverages Operating Income $ 50,365 $ 33,800 49.0%\n21\nTotal frozen beverage segment sales increased $51.5 million or 17% to $361.6 million in fiscal 2023.

The\nsales growth was largely driven by improved marketing, new customers, additional product placement, as well as a positive\npricing environment. Additional benefits were seen from our recent acquisition, and to a lessor extent, from the\ncomparative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fiscal 2022 sales compared with fiscal 2021 sales, with most of the\nlatter comparative benefit reflected in our first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 26.8% in fiscal 2022 from 26.1% in fiscal 2021. Inflation continued to\nbuild over the year which significantly pressured margins. The impact was especially pronounced in key raw material\npurchases like flour, eggs, dairy, chocolates and meats, as well as packaging and fuel. Pricing actions that were\nimplemented during fiscal 2022 helped to offset some of these significant cost pressures. Comparatively, the increase in\ngross profit percentage was largely attributable to the benefit of increased sales, as well as favorable product mix.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nTotal operating expenses increased $80.1 million to $307.8 million in fiscal 2022 and increased as a percentage of sales to\n22.3% of sales from 19.9% in fiscal 2021. The increase reflects the significant impact of inflationary pressures across the\nmajority of our cost line items including industry-wide freight and distribution cost increases, wage increases, and overall\nadministrative expense increases.\nOperating expenses included intangible asset impairment charges of $1.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.3 million in fiscal\n2021. Marketing and selling expenses decreased to 6.6% this year from 6.8% of sales in fiscal 2021 driven by effective\ninvestment of marketing dollars aligned with sales recovery. Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales increased to\n11.6% from 9.5% in fiscal 2021 due to rising freight and fuel costs. Administrative expenses were 4.0% and 3.5% of sales\nin fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOur investments generated before tax income of $1.0 million in fiscal 2022, down from $2.8 million in fiscal 2021 due to\ndecreases in the amount of investments.\nInterest expense increased by $1.0 million in fiscal 2023 due to the Company’s outstanding borrowings on the Amended\nCredit Agreement.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 was 23.5%.

The\ndecreases in operating income were primarily attributable to higher cost of goods sold as well as higher shipping and\ndistribution related costs.\nFROZEN BEVERAGES SEGMENT RESULTS\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 24, September 25,\n2022 2021\n(52 weeks) (52 weeks) % Change\n(in thousands)\nFrozen Beverages\nBeverages $ 184,063 $ 124,498 47.8%\nRepair and maintenance service 89,840 81,305 10.5%\nMachines revenue 33,601 26,953 24.7%\nOther 2,522 1,943 29.8%\nTotal Frozen Beverages $ 310,026 $ 234,699 32.1%\nFrozen Beverages Operating Income $ 33,800 $ 6,132 451.2%\nTotal frozen beverage segment sales increased 32% to $310.0 million in fiscal 2022 and beverage sales increased 48%, or\n$59.6 million, for the year. Gallon sales increased 39% from last year. The increase in gallon sales reflects the strong\ndemand across theaters, amusement parks, convenience and restaurants. In the amusement parks channel, we continued to\nsee strong growth as both domestic and international visitation numbers continued to recover, and exceeded, pre-COVID-\n19 levels. Theater sales continued on an upward trajectory as movie goers indulged in their favorite snacks and view highly\nanticipated movie releases. Service revenue increased 10% to $89.8 million in fiscal 2022 led by an acceleration in\nmaintenance calls and additional growth in one of our larger customers, earlier in fiscal 2022. Machines revenue, primarily\nsales of machines, increased from $27.0 million in fiscal 2021 to $33.6 million in fiscal 2022 driven mainly by growth from\nlarge quick service restaurant (QSR) and convenience customers.\nThe estimated number of Company-owned frozen beverage dispensers was 22,000 and 19,000 at September 24, 2022 and\nSeptember 25, 2021, respectively. Our Frozen Beverage segment had operating income of $33.8 million in fiscal 2022\ncompared to $6.1 million in fiscal 2021 primarily a result of higher beverage sales volume which drove leverage across the\nbusiness.\n25\nACQUISITIONS\nOn June 21, 2022, J & J Snack Foods Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, DD Acquisition Holdings, LLC, completed\nthe acquisition of one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests of Dippin’ Dots Holding, L.L.C. (“Dippin’ Dots”)\nwhich, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns and operates the Dippin’ Dots and Doc Popcorn businesses. The\npurchase price was approximately $223.6 million, consisting entirely of cash.\nDippin’ Dots is a leading producer of flash-frozen beaded ice cream treats, and the acquisition will leverage synergies in\nentertainment and amusement locations, theaters, and convenience to continue to expand our business. The acquisition also\nincludes the Doc Popcorn business operated by Dippin’ Dots.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and its operations are included in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAlthough there are many factors that could impact our operating cash flow, most notably net earnings, we believe that our\nfuture operating cash flow, along with our borrowing capacity, our current cash and cash equivalent balances and our\ninvestment securities is sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and beyond, as well as fund\nfuture growth and expansion.\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet earnings $ 78,906 $ 47,235\nNon-cash items in net income:\nDepreciation of fixed assets 56,616 49,669\nAmortization of intangibles and deferred costs 6,525 3,454\nIntangible asset impairment charges 1,678 1,010\n(Gains) Losses from disposals of property & equipment (409) 220\nShare-based compensation 5,318 4,269\nDeferred income taxes 10,935 8,829\n(Gain) Loss on marketable securities (8) 315\nOther 323 (95 )\nChanges in assets and liabilities, net of effects from purchase of companies 12,395 (88,844 )\nNet cash by operating activities $ 172,279 $ 26,062\n(cid:404) The increase in depreciation of fixed assets was largely due to prior year purchases of property, plant and\nequipment, as well as depreciation expense related to assets acquired in the fiscal 2022 Dippin’ Dots acquisition.\n(cid:404) The increase in amortization of intangibles and deferred costs was related to intangible assets acquired in the\nfiscal 2022 Dippin’ Dots acquisition.\n(cid:404) The increase in deferred income taxes was primarily related to increased deferred tax liabilities which arose in\nconnection with overall depreciation related temporary differences in fiscal year 2023.\n(cid:404) Cash flows associated with changes in assets and liabilities, net effects from purchase of companies, generated\napproximately $12.4 million of cash in fiscal 2023 compared with a usage of $88.8 million of cash in fiscal 2022.\nThe generation of cash in fiscal 2023 was largely the result of an improved collections environment, as well as a\nstrategic push to lower our investment in inventory related working capital balances. In fiscal 2022, the usage of\ncash was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid balances. The fiscal 2022\naccounts receivable balance increased primarily due to the overall increase in sales in our fourth quarter of fiscal\n2022 compared with fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 inventory balance increased primarily due to inflationary\npressures seen during fiscal 2022, as well as strategic decisions to store more finished goods. The fiscal 2022\nprepaid balance increased primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes.\n26\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from investing activities\nPayments for purchases of companies, net of cash acquired - (221,301 )\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (104,737) (87,291 )\nProceeds from redemption and sales of marketable securities 9,716 12,026\nProceeds from disposal of property and equipment 1,781 399\nNet cash (used in) by investing activities $ (93,240) $ (296,167 )\n(cid:404) In fiscal 2022, the payments for purchases of companies, net of cash acquired, related to the Dippin’ Dots\nacquisition.\n(cid:404) Purchases of property, plant and equipment include spending for production growth, in addition to acquiring new\nequipment, infrastructure replacements, and upgrades to maintain competitive standing and position us for future\nopportunities. The increase in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increased spend for new lines at various plants\naimed at increasing capacity.\n(cid:404) Proceeds from redemption and sales of marketable securities decreased in fiscal 2023 as in prior years, we\nstrategically chose to no longer re-invest redeemed proceeds into marketable securities given the low interest rate\nenvironment.\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from financing activities\nProceeds from issuance of stock 15,212 16,160\nBorrowings under credit facility 114,000 125,000\nRepayment of borrowings under credit facility (142,000) (70,000 )\nPayments for debt issuance costs - (225 )\nPayments on finance lease obligations (180) (279 )\nPayment of cash dividends (53,877) (48,437 )\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (66,845) $ 22,219\n(cid:404) Borrowings under credit facility and repayment of borrowings under credit facility relate to the Company’s cash\ndraws and repayments made to primarily fund working capital needs, as well as the initial draw made in fiscal\n2022 to fund the Dippin’ Dots acquisition.\n(cid:404) Dividends paid during fiscal 2023 increased as our quarterly dividend was raised during fiscal 2023.\nLiquidity\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $49.6 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with our\nexisting banks which provided for up to a $50 million revolving credit facility repayable in December 2026.\nOn June 21, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”\nwhich provided for an incremental increase of $175 million in available borrowings. The Amended Credit Agreement also\nincludes an option to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an amount not to exceed in the aggregate the\ngreater of $225 million or, $50 million plus the Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrowers, subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain terms and conditions.\nInterest accrues, at the Company’s election at (i) the BSBY Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable\nmargin, based upon the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or (ii) the Alternate Base\nRate (a rate based on the higher of (a) the prime rate announced from time-to-time by the Administrative Agent, (b) the\nFederal Reserve System’s federal funds rate, plus 0.50% or (c) the Daily BSBY Rate, plus an applicable margin). The\nAlternate Base Rate is defined in the Credit Agreement.\n27\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, including without\nlimitation (i) covenants to maintain a minimum specified interest coverage ratio and maximum specified net leverage ratio,\nand (ii) subject to certain exceptions, covenants that prevent or restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends, engage in\ncertain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments or loans, incur future indebtedness, alter its capital structure or\nline of business, prepay subordinated indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or amend its\norganizational documents. As of September 30, 2023, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants of the\nCredit Agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings drawn on the Amended Credit Agreement. As\nof September 24, 2022, we had $188.2 million of additional borrowing capacity, after giving effect to the $9.8 million of\nletters of credit outstanding.\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nPurchase Commitments\nOur most significant raw material requirements include flour, packaging, shortening, corn syrup, sugar, juice, cheese,\nchocolate, and a variety of nuts. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of\nraw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from\n1 to 12 months. As of September 30, 2023, we have approximately $125 million of such commitments. The purchase\ncommitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases with initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year covering the rental of various\nfacilities and equipment. Our operating leases include leases for real estate from some of our office, distribution and\nmanufacturing facilities as well as manufacturing and non-manufacturing equipment used in our business. As of September\n30, 2023, we have operating lease payment obligations of $94.1 million, with $16.5 million payable within 12 months.\nOff –Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has off-balance sheet arrangements for purchase commitments as of September 30, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nThe Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to its audited consolidated financial\nstatements.\nJudgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in certain areas.\nFollowing are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: revenue recognition, allowance for\nestimated credit losses, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, insurance reserves, and income taxes\nand business combinations.\n28\nRevenue Recognition\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for product and machine sales is determined by each\nindividual purchase order and the respective products ordered, with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the\nobligation under the terms of the agreement is satisfied and product control is transferred to our customer. Specifically,\ncontrol transfers to our customers when the product is delivered to, installed, or picked up by our customers based upon\napplicable shipping terms, as our customers can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the\nproduct at this point in time. The performance obligations in our customer contracts for product are generally satisfied\nwithin 30 days.\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for time and material repair and maintenance equipment\nservice is the performance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the repair\nand maintenance is completed.\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer repair and maintenance equipment service contracts is the\nperformance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized over the time the service is expected to be\nperformed. Our customers are billed for service contracts in advance of performance and therefore we have contract\nliability on our balance sheet.\nRevenue is measured by the transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in\nexchange for satisfying the performance obligations noted above. The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known\nor expected variable consideration which includes sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales and customer\nincentives, including rebates and coupon redemptions. Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a\nreduction to revenue when the related revenue is recognized, and is recorded using the most likely amount method, with\nupdates to estimates and related accruals of variable consideration occurring each period based on historical experience,\nchanges in circumstances and other factors, including review of contractual pricing and rebate arrangements with\ncustomers.\nWe do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in the estimates or assumptions\nused to recognize revenue. As noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. However,\nif the level of redemption rates or performance was to vary significantly from estimates, we may be exposed to gains or\nlosses that could be material. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize\nrevenue during the past three fiscal years.\nAllowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nWe provide an allowance for estimated credit losses after taking into consideration historical experience and other factors.\nOn September 27, 2020, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB in ASU 2016-13 Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments, which requires companies to recognize an allowance that reflects a current estimate of\ncredit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the asset. The Company continuously monitors collections and\npayments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses. The allowance for estimated credit\nlosses considers a number of factors including the age of receivable balances, the history of losses, expectations of future\ncredit losses and the customers’ ability to pay off obligations.\nWe do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions\nused to value our accounts receivable. Since adoption of the new guidance on September 27, 2020, we have not made any\nmaterial changes in the accounting methodology used to value accounts receivable.\nValuation of Goodwill\nWe have three reporting units with goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated annually by the Company for impairment. We perform\nimpairment tests at year end for our reporting units, which are also the operating segment levels with recorded goodwill\nutilizing primarily the discounted cash flow method. This methodology used to estimate the fair value of the total Company\nand its reporting units requires inputs and assumptions (i.e. revenue growth, operating profit margins, capital spending\nrequirements and discount rates) that reflect current market conditions. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is\ncompared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the\ngoodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired, and the Company then determines the implied fair value of goodwill,\nwhich is compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine if impairment exists. Our tests at September 30, 2023\nshow that the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by at least 50%. Therefore,\nno further analysis was required.\n29\nThe inputs and assumptions used involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about\nexpected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The\nactual performance of the reporting units could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions,\noperating performance, economic conditions, competition, and consumer preferences. We have not made any material\nchanges in the accounting methodology used to value goodwill during the past three fiscal years.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets and Other Intangible Assets\nWe record an impairment charge to property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets in accordance with the\napplicable accounting standards, when, based on certain indicators of impairment, we believe such assets have experienced\na decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of\nthese underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be\nreflected in the asset’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future.\nIndefinite lived intangibles are reviewed annually for impairment. The fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets is\ncalculated using either a relief from royalty valuation approach, or the excess earnings method. We are required to make\nestimates and assumptions about sales growth, royalty rates, and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic\nprojections, and marketplace data. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could\npositively or negatively impact the future economic and operating conditions.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of long-lived assets\nand other intangibles during the last three fiscal years. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and\nassumptions to calculate fair value of these assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not\nconsistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in a material impairment of our\nlong-lived assets and other intangibles.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe have a self-insured medical plan which covers approximately 1,800 of our employees. We record a liability for incurred\nbut not yet reported or paid claims based on our historical experience of claims payments and a calculated lag time period.\nConsidering that we have stop loss coverage of $225,000 for each individual plan subscriber, the general consistency of\nclaims payments and the short time lag, we believe that there is not a material exposure for this liability.\nWe self-insure, up to loss limits, workers’ compensation, automobile and general liability claims. Insurance reserves are\ncalculated on a combination of an undiscounted basis based on actual claims data and estimates of incurred but not reported\nclaims developed utilizing historical claims trends. Projected settlements of incurred but not reported claims are estimated\nbased on pending claims, historical trends, industry trends related to expected losses and actual reported losses, and key\nassumptions, including loss development factors and expected loss rates.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during\nthe past three fiscal years. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the\nestimate or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our\nestimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.\nIncome Taxes\nThe annual tax rate is based on our income and statutory tax rates. Changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate may have a material effect on our annual tax rate. The effect of these changes, if any, would be\nrecognized as a discrete item upon enactment.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues\nand expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in\nwhich the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to account for income taxes during the past\nthree fiscal years. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Other\nthan those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in tax\nrelated balances.\n30\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. We use various models to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as the net realizable value method\nto value inventory, and the cost method and market approach to value property, plant and equipment. The determination of\nthe fair value of intangible assets, which can represent a significant portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions, requires\nthe use of significant judgement with regard to the fair value, and whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable\nand, if the former, the period and method by which the intangible will be amortized. We estimate the fair value of acquisition-\nrelated intangibles either through the relief of royalty method or multi-period excess earnings method, or based on projections\nof cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which includes estimate of customer\nattrition. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the date of acquisition. For\nsignificant acquisitions, we may use independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to account for business combinations during\nthe past three fiscal years. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the\nestimate or assumptions used to determine the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nHowever, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to impairment charges\nthat could be material.\n31\nItem 7A. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe following is the Company’s quantitative and qualitative analysis of its financial market risk:\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nThe Company has in the past entered into interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to interest rate risk and may do so in the\nfuture if the Board of Directors feels that such non-trading hedging is in the best interest of the Company and its\nshareholders. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no interest rate swap contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had variable rate debt of $27.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of\n6.48%. If borrowing rates were to increase 1% above the current rates, it would increase interest expense by $0.3 million on\nan annual basis.\nPurchasing Risk\nThe Company’s most significant raw material requirements include flour, shortening, corn syrup, sugar, juice, cheese,\nchocolate, and a variety of nuts. The Company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the\npurchase of raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for\nperiods from 1 to 12 months. Future contracts are not used in combination with forward purchasing of these raw materials.\nThe Company’s procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially\nlimit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company has not entered into any forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency rate risk as of September\n30, 2023, because it does not believe its foreign exchange exposure is significant.\nItem 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements of the Company are filed under this Item 8, beginning on page F-1 of this report.\nItem 9. Changes In And Disagreements With Accountants On Accounting And Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n32\nItem 9A. Controls And Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act for financial reporting, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that these\ncontrols and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures\ninclude, among other things, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed\nby, or under the supervision of, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by the board of directors\nand management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\n(cid:404) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of our assets;\n(cid:404) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors;\n(cid:404) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nProjections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In\nmaking this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.\nBased on our assessment, our management believes that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective. There have been no changes that occurred during our fourth quarter that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, audited our internal control over financial\nreporting as of September 30, 2023. Their report, dated November 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on our\ninternal control over financial reporting. That report appears in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and\nis incorporated by reference to this Item 9A.\n33\nItem 9B. Other Information\nNone of our directors or executive officers adopted, modified or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the\npurchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any\n“non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K\nThere was no information required on Form 8-K during the quarter that was not reported.\nItem 9C.

(a New Jersey corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of\nearnings, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively\nreferred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated November 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nNet Revenue Adjustments\nAs described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, contracts with customers include some form of variable\nconsideration, including sales discounts, trade promotions and certain other sales and consumer incentives, including\nrebates. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction in revenue when the related revenue is recognized, and is recorded\nusing the most likely amount method, with updates to estimates and related accruals of variable consideration occurring\neach period based on historical experience and changes in circumstances.\nWe identified the estimation of certain subsidiaries’ reserves for these net revenue adjustments by management as a critical\naudit matter because the inputs and assumptions utilized by management in estimating these reserves, including consistency\nof historical data and estimates of future customer credits, require significant judgment and create a high degree of\nestimation uncertainty. Consequently, auditing these assumptions require subjective auditor judgment.\nF - 2\nOur audit procedures related to the estimation of the reserves included the following, among others:\n(cid:404) We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls\nrelating to management’s calculation of the reserves for net revenue adjustments, including understanding relevant\ninputs and assumptions of key management review controls over the period-end accrual of allowances and end-\nuser pricing adjustments.\n(cid:404) We re-performed management’s process for calculating the reserves for net revenue adjustments.\n(cid:404) We evaluated key inputs relevant to the net revenue adjustments, including contractual pricing and rebate\narrangements with customers and historical allowance data, which were compared to source documents. We\nevaluated key assumptions relevant to net revenue adjustments, including the consistency of historical data and\nestimates of future customer credits.\n(cid:404) We evaluated transactions subsequent to year end, which involved inspecting customer credits and relevant source\ndocuments submitted by customers in conjunction with the allowance, including end-user pricing adjustments.\n/s/GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1984.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 28, 2023\nF - 3\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nJ&J Snack Foods Corp. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of J&J Snack Foods Corp. (a New Jersey corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30,\n2023, and our report dated November 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\nall material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 28, 2023\nF - 4\nItem 8.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nJ & J Snack Foods Corp. and Subsidiaries (“the Company”) manufactures, markets and distributes a variety of nutritional\nsnack foods and beverages to the foodservice and retail supermarket industries. A summary of the significant accounting\npolicies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows. Our 2023\nfiscal year comprises 53 weeks. All references to 2023 fiscal year refer to that 53-week period. Fiscal years 2022 and 2021\ncomprised 52 weeks.\n1. Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These financial statements include the\naccounts of J & J Snack Foods Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n2. Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”\nWhen Performance Obligations Are Satisfied\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of\naccount for revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and\nrecognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for product and machine sales is determined by each\nindividual purchase order and the respective products ordered, with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the\nobligation under the terms of the agreement is satisfied and product control is transferred to our customer. Specifically,\ncontrol transfers to our customers when the product is delivered to, installed or picked up by our customers based upon\napplicable shipping terms, as our customers can direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the\nproduct at this point in time. The performance obligations in our customer contracts for product are generally satisfied\nwithin 30 days.\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer contracts for time and material repair and maintenance equipment\nservice is the performance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized at a point-in-time when the repair\nand maintenance is completed.\nThe singular performance obligation of our customer repair and maintenance equipment service contracts is the\nperformance of the repair and maintenance with revenue being recognized over the time the service is expected to be\nperformed. Our customers are billed for service contracts in advance of performance and therefore we have a contract\nliability on our balance sheet.\nSignificant Payment Terms\nIn general, within our customer contracts, the purchase order identifies the product, quantity, price, pick-up allowances,\npayment terms and final delivery terms. Although some payment terms may be more extended, presently the majority of\nour payment terms are 30 days. As a result, we have used the available practical expedient and, consequently, do not adjust\nour revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.\nF - 10\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nShipping\nAll amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenues; therefore, we recognize revenue\nfor shipping and handling fees at the time the products are shipped or when services are performed. The cost of shipping\nproducts to the customer is recognized at the time the products are shipped to the customer and our policy is to classify\nthem as Distribution expenses.\nVariable Consideration\nIn addition to fixed contract consideration, our contracts include some form of variable consideration, including sales\ndiscounts, trade promotions and certain other sales and consumer incentives, including rebates and coupon redemptions. In\ngeneral, variable consideration is treated as a reduction in revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Depending on\nthe specific type of variable consideration, we use the most likely amount method to determine the variable consideration.\nWe believe there will be no significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any related uncertainties are\nresolved with our customers. We review and update our estimates and related accruals of variable consideration each period\nbased on historical experience. Our recorded liability for allowances, end-user pricing adjustments and trade spending was\napproximately $18.9 million at September 30, 2023 and $14.7 million at September 24, 2022.\nWarranties & Returns\nWe provide all customers with a standard or assurance type warranty. Either stated or implied, we provide assurance the\nrelated products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications and other warranties provided under the law. No services\nbeyond an assurance warranty are provided to our customers.\nWe do not grant a general right of return. However, customers may return defective or non-conforming products. Customer\nremedies may include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. We do not estimate a right of return and related\nrefund liability as returns of our products are rare.\nContract Balances\nOur customers are billed for service contracts in advance of performance and therefore we have a contract liability on our\nbalance sheet as follows:\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBeginning Balance $ 4,926 $ 1,097\nAdditions to contract liability 6,802 9,163\nAmounts recognized as revenue (6,422) (5,334)\nEnding Balance $ 5,306 $ 4,926\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSee Note N for disaggregation of our net sales by class of similar product and type of customer.\nF - 11\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for Estimated Credit Losses\nThe Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated\ncredit losses. The allowance for estimated credit losses considers a number of factors including the age of receivable\nbalances, the history of losses, expectations of future credit losses and the customers’ ability to pay off obligations. The\nallowance for estimated credit losses was $3.2 million and $2.2 million on September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022,\nrespectively.\n3. Foreign Currency\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance\nsheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period. The cumulative translation\nadjustment is recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and changes to such are included in comprehensive\nincome.\n4. Use of Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n5. Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n6. Concentrations and related risks\nWe maintain cash balances at financial institutions located in various states. We have cash balances at six banks totaling\napproximately $14 million that is in excess of federally insured limits.\nFinancial instruments that could potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are trade accounts receivable;\nhowever, such risks are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion\nacross geographic regions. We have approximately 31 customers with accounts receivable balances of between $1 million\nand $10 million and five customers with a balance greater than $10 million, with the largest being approximately $24\nmillion.\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for\n43%, 43% and 43% of our sales during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with our largest customer\naccounting for 9% of our sales in 2023, 8% of our sales in 2022 and 11% of our sales in 2021. Five of the ten customers are\nfood distributors who sell our product to many end users.\nAbout 28% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nNone of our vendors supplied more than 10% of our ingredients and packaging in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nF - 12\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nVirtually all of our accounts receivable are due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of our\ncustomers’ financial condition and collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the\nfinancial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for estimated credit losses. At September 30, 2023\nand September 24, 2022, our accounts receivables were $198.1 million and $208.2 million, net of an allowance for\nestimated credit losses of $3.2 million and $2.2 million. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the payment terms are\nconsidered past due. We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade\naccounts receivable are past due, our previous loss history, customers’ current ability to pay their obligations to us, and the\ncondition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. We write off accounts receivable when they become\nuncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for estimated credit\nlosses.\n7. Inventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. We\nrecognize abnormal amounts of idle facilities, freight, handling costs, and spoilage as charges of the current period.\nAdditionally, we allocate fixed production overhead to inventories based on the normal capacity of our production\nfacilities. We calculate normal capacity as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons\nunder normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. This requires us\nto use judgment to determine when production is outside the range of expected variation in production (either abnormally\nlow or abnormally high). In periods of abnormally low production (for example, periods in which there is significantly\nlower demand, labor and material shortages exist, or there is unplanned equipment downtime) the amount of fixed overhead\nallocated to each unit of production is not increased. However, in periods of abnormally high production the amount of\nfixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased to assure inventories are not measured above cost.\n8. Investment Securities\nWe classify our investment securities in one of three categories: held to maturity, trading, or available for sale. We held no\ninvestment securities at September 30, 2023. Our investment portfolio at September 24, 2022 consisted of investments\nclassified as held to maturity and available for sale. The securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to\nmaturity are classified as held to maturity and are stated at amortized cost. Investments classified as available for sale are\nreported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses related to the changes in fair value of the securities\nrecognized in investment income. The mutual funds and preferred stock in our available for sale portfolio do not have\ncontractual maturities; however, we classify them as long-term assets as it is our intent to hold them for a period of over\none year, although we may sell some or all of them depending on presently unanticipated needs for liquidity or market\nconditions. See Note C for further information on our holdings of investment securities.\n9. Depreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation of equipment and buildings is provided for by the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives.\nWe review our equipment and buildings to ensure that they provide economic benefit and are not impaired.\nAmortization of leasehold improvements is provided for by the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the assets’\nestimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Licenses and rights, customer relationships, technology, non-compete\nagreements, and franchise agreements and certain tradenames are being amortized by the straight-line method over periods\nranging from 2 to 20 years and amortization expense is reflected throughout operating expenses.\nF - 13\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-lived assets, including fixed assets and amortizing intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in\ncircumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount ofthe asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite lived intangibles are\nreviewed annually for impairment. Cash flow and sales analyses are used to assess impairment. The estimates of future cash\nflows and sales involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future\noperating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows\nand sales could differ from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance,\neconomic conditions, competition, and consumer preferences.\n10. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of our short-term financial instruments, such as accounts receivables and accounts payable, approximate\ntheir fair values, based on the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n11. Income Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes under the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured\nby the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense is the result of changes in\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, we recognize a liability for income taxes and associated penalties and interest for tax positions taken or\nexpected to be taken in a tax return which are more likely than not to be overturned by taxing authorities (“uncertain tax\npositions”). We have not recognized a tax benefit in our financial statements for these uncertain tax positions.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $0.3 million\nand $0.3 million, respectively, all of which would impact our effective tax rate over time, if recognized. We recognize\ninterest and penalties related to income tax matters as a part of the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2023\nand September 24, 2022, we had $0.3 million of accrued interest and penalties. A reconciliation of the beginning and\nending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n(in thousands)\nBalance at September 24, 2022 $ 343\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year -\nReductions for tax positions of prior years -\nSettlements -\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ 343\nIn addition to our federal tax return and tax returns for Mexico and Canada, we file tax returns in all states that have a\ncorporate income tax. Virtually all the returns noted above are open for examination for three to four years.\nOur effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 26.6%. Our effective tax rate in our fiscal 2022 year was 23.5% and in fiscal 2021\nwas 24.9%.\nF - 14\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12. Earnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common\nshareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS takes into consideration\nthe potential dilution that could occur if securities (stock options) or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised\nand converted into common stock.\nOur calculation of EPS is as follows:\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2023\nIncome Shares Per Share\n(Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nBasic EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders $ 78,906 19,257 $ 4.10\nEffect of dilutive securities\nRSU's and options $ - 67 (0.02 )\nDiluted EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders plus assumed\nconversions $ 78,906 19,324 $ 4.08\n252,044 anti-dilutive shares have been excluded in the computation of fiscal year 2023 diluted EPS.\nFiscal year ended September 24, 2022\nIncome Shares Per Share\n(Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nBasic EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders $ 47,235 19,148 $ 2.47\nEffect of dilutive securities\nRSU's and options $ - 65 (0.01 )\nDiluted EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders plus assumed\nconversions $ 47,235 19,213 $ 2.46\n287,558 anti-dilutive shares have been excluded in the computation of fiscal year 2022 diluted EPS.\nFiscal year ended September 25, 2021\nIncome Shares Per Share\n(Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nBasic EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders $ 55,607 19,013 $ 2.92\nEffect of dilutive securities\nRSU's and options $ - 120 (0.01 )\nDiluted EPS\nNet earnings available to common stockholders plus assumed\nconversions $ 55,607 19,133 $ 2.91\n284,480 anti-dilutive shares have been excluded in the computation of fiscal year 2021 diluted EPS.\nF - 15\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans. Share-based compensation was\nrecognized as follows:\nFiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, September 24, September 25,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nStock options $ 1,882 $ 2,407 $ 2,265\nStockpurchase plan 555 389 573\nStock issued to outside directors 106 - 44\nService share units issued to employees 1,043 538 93\nPerformance share units issued to employees 633 - -\nTotal share-based compensation $ 4,219 $ 3,334 $ 2,975\nThe above compensation is net of tax benefits $ 1,099 $ 935 $ 1,224\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. No\ngrants of options were made in fiscal 2023. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in fiscal\n2022 and 2021: expected volatility of 25.8% for both fiscal years; weighted average risk-free interest rates of 0.8% for both\nfiscal years; dividend rate of 1.6% for fiscal 2022 and 1.4% for fiscal 2021; and expected lives ranging between 4 and 10\nyears for both fiscal years.\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common shares over the past 51 months for 5-year\noptions and 10 years for 10-year options. We use historical information to estimate expected life and forfeitures within the\nvaluation model. The expected term of awards represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be\noutstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in\neffect at the time of grant. Compensation cost is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting or service period\nand is net of estimated forfeitures.\nThe Company issued 21,864 service share units (“RSU”)’s in fiscal 2023 and 9,200 RSUs in fiscal 2022. Each RSU entitles\nthe awardee to one share of common stock upon vesting. The fair value of the RSU’s was determined based upon the\nclosing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. No such RSU’s were issued in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company also issued 21,260 performance share units (“PSU”)’s in fiscal 2023 and 8,868 PSUs in fiscal 2022. Each\nPSU may result in the issuance of up to two shares of common stock upon vesting, dependent upon the level of\nachievement of the applicable performance goal. The fair value of the PSU’s was determined based upon the closing price\nof the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, the Company applies a quarterly probability\nassessment in computing this non-cash compensation expense, and any change in estimate is reflected as a cumulative\nadjustment to expense in the quarter of the change. No such PSU’s were issued in fiscal 2021.\n14. Advertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expense was $9.7 million, $7.0 million, and $4.9 million for\nthe fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n15. Commodity Price Risk Management\nOur most significant raw material requirements include flour, packaging, shortening, corn syrup, sugar, juice, cheese,\nchocolate, and a variety of nuts. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of\nraw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from\n1 to 12 months. As of September 30, 2023, we have approximately $125 million of such commitments. Futures contracts\nare not used in combination with forward purchasing of these raw materials. Our procurement practices are intended to\nF - 16\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nreduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.\nAt each of the last three fiscal year ends, we did not have any material losses on our purchase commitments.\n16. Research and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Total research and development expense was $1.2 million, $0.7\nmillion and $0.6 million for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n17. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date\nof Topic 848\", to provide optional guidance to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the\neffects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Preceding the issuance of ASU 2020-04, which established ASC\n848, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it would no longer need to persuade or\ncompel banks to submit to LIBOR after December 31, 2021. In response, the FASB established December 31, 2022 as the\nexpiration date for ASC 848. In March 2021, the FCA announced the intended cessation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and\n12-month USD LIBOR would be June 30, 2023. Because the current relief in Topic 848 may not cover a period of time\nduring which a significant number of modifications may take place, this update deferred the sunset date in Topic 848 from\nDecember 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848.\nThis guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04 “Liabilities – Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50):\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations”. This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities\nthat use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. These amendments are effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n18. Reclassifications\nCertain prior year financial statement amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the presentation for the current\nyear.\nNOTE B – ACQUISITIONS\nOn June 21, 2022, J & J Snack Foods Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, DD Acquisition Holdings, LLC, completed\nthe acquisition of one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests of Dippin’ Dots Holding, L.L.C. (“Dippin’ Dots”)\nwhich, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns and operates the Dippin’ Dots and Doc Popcorn businesses. The\npurchase price was approximately $223.6 million, consisting entirely of cash, and may be modified for certain customary\npost-closing purchase price adjustments.\nDippin’ Dots is a leading producer of flash-frozen beaded ice cream treats, and the acquisition will leverage synergies in\nentertainment and amusement locations, theaters, and convenience to continue to expand our business. The acquisition also\nincludes the Doc Popcorn business operated by Dippin’ Dots.\nThe financial results of Dippin’ Dots have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the\nacquisition. Sales and net earnings of Dippin’ Dots $96.0 million and $13.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023,\nand $33.7 million and $4.9 million for the year ended September 24, 2022. Dippin’ Dots is reported as part of our Food\nService segment.

In addition, the excess of the purchase price\nover the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The fair value estimates used in valuing certain\nacquired assets and liabilities are based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. For intangible assets, these include, but are\nnot limited to, forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates.\nThe purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as\nmore detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed becomes available.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a measurement period adjustment to the estimated fair values initially recorded on June 21,\n2022, which resulted in an increase in Other Current Liabilities of $0.7 million and an increase in Goodwill of $0.7 million.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we previously recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded\non June 21, 2022, which resulted in an increase to Property, plant, and equipment, net of $6.5 million, and reductions in\nGoodwill, Identifiable intangible assets, and Inventories of $4.0 million, $2.2 million, and $0.3 million, respectively.

The FASB\ndefines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such\nassumptions, the FASB has established three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 Observable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs in active markets, that are observable either directly or\nindirectly; and\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop\nits own assumptions.\nMarketable securities held to maturity and available for sale consist primarily of investments in mutual funds, preferred\nstock and corporate bonds. The fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices in active markets and are\nclassified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of preferred stock and corporate bonds are based on\nquoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active. As a result, preferred stock and corporate\nbonds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company held no held to maturity investment securities or marketable securities available\nfor sale.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2023, the Company did not hold any mutual fund investments. However, during the fiscal year, the\nmutual funds held sought current income with an emphasis on maintaining low volatility and overall moderate duration.\nThe mutual funds generated income of about 6.8% in the fiscal year. As of the end of fiscal 2023, the Company was not\ninvested in Fixed-to-Floating Perpetual Preferred Stock. However, during the fiscal year, the Company held investments in\nFixed-to-Floating Perpetual Preferred Stock which generated fixed income to call dates in 2025 and then income was based\non a spread above LIBOR if the securities were not called. The annual yield from these investments was 6.1% in the fiscal\nyear, of which 50% is not subject to income tax.

The amortization period used for definite lived\nintangible assets is set by contract period or by the period over which the bulk of the discounted cash flow is expected to be\ngenerated. We currently believe that we will receive the benefit from the use of the trade names and distribution rights\nclassified as indefinite lived intangible assets indefinitely and they are therefore not amortized.\nF - 23\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLicenses and rights, customer relationships, franchise agreements, technology and non-compete agreements are being\namortized by the straight-line method over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years and amortization expense is reflected\nthroughout operating expenses.\nAmortizing and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur\nindicating that the carrying amount ofthe asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite lived intangibles are also reviewed\nannually at year end for impairment. Cash flow and sales analyses are used to assess impairment. The estimates of future\ncash flows and sales involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future\noperating performance which include Level 3 inputs such as annual growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions used in\nthese forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows and sales could differ from management’s\nestimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, economic conditions, competition, and consumer\npreferences.\nIn connection with our annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of 2023, we determined that the\ncarrying amounts of three trade names exceeded their fair value as of September 30, 2023. As a result, the Company\nrecorded an indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The intangible\nasset impairment charge is reflected in Intangible asset impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The\n$1.7 million intangible asset impairment charge related to trade names in the Food Service segment.\nThere were no intangible assets acquired in the fiscal year 2023. In fiscal year 2022, intangible assets of $118.2 million\nwere added in the food service segment from the acquisition of Dippin’ Dots in the quarter ended June 25, 2022. There\nwere no intangible assets acquired in the fiscal year 2021.\nAggregate amortization expense of intangible assets for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $6.5 million, $3.5\nmillion, and $2.6 million, respectively.\nEstimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is approximately $6.2 million in 2024, $5.6 million in 2025\nand 2026, $4.6 million in 2027, and $4.2 million in 2028.\nThe weighted amortization period of the intangible assets, in total, is 10.4 years. The weighted amortization period by\nintangible asset class is 10 years for Technology, 10 years for Customer relationships, 20 years for Licenses & rights, and\n10 years for Franchise agreements.\nGoodwill\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill for the reportable segments are as follows:\nFood Retail Frozen\nService Supermarket Beverages Total\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2023 $ 124,426 $ 4,146 $ 56,498 $ 185,070\nSeptember 24, 2022 $ 123,776 $ 4,146 $ 56,498 $ 184,420\nThe carrying value of goodwill is determined based on the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the estimated\nfair value of tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually at year end by management\nfor impairment. Our impairment analysis for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was based on a combination of the income\napproach, which estimates the fair value of reporting units based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which\nestimates the fair value of reporting units based on comparable market prices and multiples. Under the income approach the\nCompany used a discounted cash flow which requires Level 3 inputs such as: annual growth rates, discount rates based\nupon the weighted average cost of capital and terminal values based upon current stock market multiples. There were no\nimpairment charges to goodwill in fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nIn fiscal year 2023, goodwill of $0.7 million was added in the food service segment from measurement period adjustments\nrelated to the prior year acquisition of Dippin’ Dots. In fiscal year 2022, goodwill of $62.6 million was added in the food\nservice segment from the acquisition of Dippin’ Dots in the quarter ended June 25, 2022. No goodwill was acquired in\nfiscal years 2021.\nF - 24\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP.

Except for current year usage, we have no foreseeable capital gains\nthat would allow us to use this asset. Accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of this\ndeferred tax asset.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have a federal net operating loss carry forward of approximately $2.2 million from the\nPHILLY SWIRL acquisition. These carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation under Code Section 382 of\napproximately $0.4 million and will expire in 2033. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, we have state net operating\nloss carry forwards of approximately $0.5 million. These state operating losses begin to expire in 2034. We have\ndetermined there are no limitations to the total use of these tax assets and, accordingly, have not recorded a valuation\nallowance for these deferred tax assets.\nWe have undistributed earnings of our Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries. We are no longer permanently reinvested in\nearnings of our foreign subsidiaries for any year. No additional U.S. federal income taxes are anticipated if our\nundistributed earnings in our Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries were repatriated to the U.S. However, if such funds were\nrepatriated, a portion of the funds remitted may be subject to applicable state income taxes and non-U.S. income and\nwithholding taxes. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities related to potential state income tax and\nforeign withholding taxes is immaterial.\nThe Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, which\nintroduced and revised numerous provisions including a technical correction to qualified improvement property for assets\nplaced in service after 2017 through 2022 to allow for immediate depreciation to be claimed on these assets and the deferral\nof employer’s share of certain payroll taxes. As a result of the CARES Act, we deferred $4.3 million of payroll taxes as of\nSeptember 24, 2022. No payroll taxes were deferred as of September 30, 2023.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA made several changes to\nthe U.S. tax code effective after December 31, 2022, including, but not limited to, a 15% minimum tax on large\ncorporations with average annual financial statement income of more than $1 billion for a three tax-year period and a 1%\nexcise tax on public company stock buybacks, which will be accounted for in treasury stock. We do not expect these\nchanges to have a material impact on our provision for income taxes or financial statements.\nNOTE I - COMMITMENTS\nWe are a party to litigation which has arisen in the normal course of business which management currently believes will not\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe self-insure, up to loss limits, certain insurable risks such as workers’ compensation, automobile, and general liability\nclaims. Accruals for claims under our self-insurance program are recorded on a claims incurred basis. Our total recorded\nliability for all years’ claims incurred but not yet paid was $13.4 million and $13.7 million at September 30, 2023 and\nSeptember 24, 2022, respectively.

At both September 30, 2023, and September 24, 2022, we had outstanding letters of\ncredit totaling $9.8 million, respectively.\nWe have a self-insured medical plan which covers approximately 1,800 of our employees. We record a liability for incurred\nbut not yet reported or paid claims based on our historical experience of claims payments and a calculated lag time period.\nOur recorded liability at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nNOTE J - CAPITAL STOCK\nWith the exception of shares withheld to cover taxes associated with the vesting of certain restricted stock units held by\nofficers and employees, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock in our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023,\nSeptember 24, 2022, and September 25, 2021.\nF - 27\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE K – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Pursuant to the Plan, stock options, which qualify as incentive stock\noptions as well as stock options which are nonqualified, restricted stock units, and performance awards may be granted to\nofficers and our key employees.\nThe exercise price of incentive stock options is at least the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The\nexercise price for nonqualified options is determined by a committee of the Board of Directors. The options are generally\nexercisable after three years and expire no later than ten years from date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is\nestimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nPerformance awards may include (i) specific dollar-value target awards, (ii) performance units, or (iii) performance shares.\nThe vesting of performance based awards, if any, is dependent upon the achievement of certain performance targets. If the\nperformance standards are not achieved, all unvested units will expire, and any accrued expense will be reversed. The fair\nvalue of the grant is determined based upon the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.\nThere are approximately 462,000 shares reserved under the Plan for which options, restricted stock units, and performance\nawards have not yet been issued. There are options that were issued under prior option plans that have since been replaced\nthat are still outstanding.\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) whereby employees purchase stock by making contributions through\npayroll deductions for six-month periods. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the market price of the\nstock at the beginning of the six-month period or the end of the six-month period. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021\nemployees purchased 17,231, 16,274 and 11,988 shares at average purchase prices of $121.53, $124.94, and $116.03,\nrespectively.

Certain of these leases contain renewal options and some provide options to purchase during the\nlease term. Our operating leases include leases for real estate from some of our office, warehouse, and manufacturing\nfacilities as well as manufacturing and non-manufacturing equipment used in our business. The remaining lease terms for\nthese operating leases range from 1 month to 20 years.\nWe have finance leases with initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year covering the rental of various\nequipment. These leases are generally for manufacturing and non-manufacturing equipment used in our business. The\nremaining lease terms for these finance leases range from 1 year to 5 years.\nF - 33\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant Assumptions and Judgments\nContract Contains a Lease\nIn evaluating our contracts to determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we considered the following:\n(cid:404) Whether explicitly or implicitly identified assets have been deployed in the contract; and\n(cid:404) Whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset, and we can\ndirect how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract.\nAllocation of Consideration\nIn determining how to allocate consideration between lease and non-lease components in a contract that was deemed to\ncontain a lease, we used judgment and consistent application of assumptions to reasonably allocate the consideration.\nOptions to Extend or Terminate Leases\nWe have leases which contain options to extend or terminate the leases. On a lease-by-lease basis, we have determined if\nthe extension should be considered reasonably certain to be exercised and thus a right-of-use asset and a lease liability\nshould be recorded.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate for leases, if not explicitly stated in the lease, is the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of\ninterest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease\npayments in a similar economic environment.\nWe used a discount rate to calculate the present value of the lease liability at the date of adoption. In the development of the\ndiscount rate, we considered our internal borrowing rate, treasury security rates, collateral, and credit risk specific to us, and\nour lease portfolio characteristics.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the weighted-average discount rate of our operating and finance leases was 4.4% and 3.9%,\nrespectively. As of September 24, 2022, the weighted-average discount rate of our operating and finance leases was 3.3%\nand 3.2%, respectively.\nAmounts Recognized in the Financial Statements\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nFiscal year Fiscal year\nended ended\nSeptember 30, September 24,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease cost in Cost of goods sold and Operating expenses $ 17,352 $ 15,611\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of assets in Cost of goods sold and Operating expenses $ 270 $ 160\nInterest on lease liabilities in Interest expense & other 22 13\nTotal finance lease cost $ 292 $ 173\nShort-term lease cost in Cost of goods sold and Operating expenses - -\nTotal net lease cost $ 17,644 $ 15,784\nF - 34\nJ & J SNACK FOODS CORP.
