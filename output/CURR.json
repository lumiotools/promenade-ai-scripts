Announces Third Quarter 2024 Unaudited Financial Results\n\n11/29/2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nSINGAPORE, Nov. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CURRENC Group Inc. (Nasdaq: CURR) (“CURRENC” or the “Company”), a fintech and digital remittance pioneer serving millions of unbanked and underbanked individuals in Southeast Asia and beyond, recently announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter and First Nine Months 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Total Processing Value (TPV)** was US$1.21 billion for the third quarter and US$3.92 billion for the first nine months of 2024, increasing by 6.1% and 18.8% year over year, respectively. \n  * **Total revenues**(contributed by subsidiaries Tranglo, WalletKu, TNG Asia and GEA,1 as well as other services) were US$11.3 million for the third quarter and US$35.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, representing year-over-year decreases of 11.0% and 11.3%, respectively. The decreases were mainly due to declines of 22.1% and 22.3% in global airtime revenue, respectively, as well as declines in TNG Asia and GEA’s remittance revenues. As TNG Asia and GEA were divested during the third quarter, going forward, the Company’s total revenues will be comprised mainly of revenues contributed by Tranglo’s remittance and global airtime businesses and WalletKu’s Indonesian airtime business.\n  * **Total remittance revenues**(contributed by Tranglo, TNG Asia and GEA) were US$4.9 million for the third quarter and US$17.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, representing year-over-year decreases of 22.2% and 10.6%, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to declines in TNG Asia and GEA’s remittance business. As TNG Asia and GEA were divested during the third quarter, going forward, the Company’s remittance revenues will be contributed solely by Tranglo.\n  * **Tranglo’s remittance revenues** were US$4.5 million for the third quarter, down 1.0% year over year, and US$14.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, remaining stable year over year.\n  * **CURRENC’s global airtime transfer revenues** were US$2.3 million for the third quarter and US$7.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, representing year-over-year decreases of 22.1% and 22.3%, respectively.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA****2****loss** for the third quarter was US$0.2 million, narrowing by 83.3% year over year from US$1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, it was US$0.6 million, narrowing by 75.0% year over year from US$2.4 million for the same period of 2023.\n  * **Net loss** was US$5.0 million for the third quarter and US$11.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, increasing by 31.6% and 8.7% year over year, respectively.\n  * **Total comprehensive loss attributable to CURRENC Group Inc.** was US$5.1 million for the third quarter and US$12.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, increasing by 34.2% and 15.2% year over year, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter and First Nine Months 2024 Core Businesses****3****Highlights** _(All monetary values in $ millions unless otherwise noted)_\n\n**For the three-month****period ended September 30,**| **For the nine-month****period ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Tranglo: Digital Remittance**  \nTotal processing value (TPV)| $1,210| $1,140| $3,920| $3,300  \nNumber of Transactions (millions)| 2.71| 2.72| 8.56| 8.11  \nRemittance Revenues| $4.5| $4.6| $14.3| $14.3  \nOverall take rates (%)| 0.37%| 0.40%| 0.36%| 0.43%  \n**Tranglo: Global Airtime Transfer**|  $2.3| $2.95| $7.3| $9.4  \n**WalletKu: Indonesian Airtime**|  $4.0| $3.4| $10.2| $10.5  \n**Operating Expenses**|  $19.14| $6.5| $30.04| $18.8  \n  \n**Third Quarter and First Nine Months Core Businesses Revenue Breakdown****5**\n\n**For the three-month****period ended September 30,**| **For the nine-month****period ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRemittance services| $4.5| $4.6| $14.3| $14.3  \nSales of Airtime| $6.3| $6.4| $17.5| $19.9  \n**Revenue Excluding TNG Asia and GEA**| **$****10.8**| **$****11.0**| **$****31.8**| **$****34.2**  \n  \n**Management Comments** \"We are delighted to report a strong start to our journey as a publicly-listed company, highlighted by notable strategic achievements and operational excellence in the third quarter,\" said Alex Kong, Founder and Executive Chairman of CURRENC. \"Prior to our Nasdaq listing, we divested two subsidiaries, GEA and TNG Asia, streamlining our operations to prioritize Tranglo, our sole remaining digital remittance platform. Having positioned digital remittance as the primary driver of CURRENC’s future growth, we are now focused on expanding Tranglo’s business scope and coverage network. Tranglo’s TPV was $1.21 billion for the third quarter and $3.92 billion for the first nine months, up 6.1% and 18.8% compared with the same periods last year, respectively. This growth not only underscores our success in elevating our position in the global remittance market but also reflects our clients’ growing trust and confidence in our technology and compliance. While our overall transaction fees take rate declined year over year for both periods as we offered more competitive pricing to gain market share, this was offset by improvements in forex take rates and payout agency rates, driven by our unwavering commitment to cost- and operational efficiency. As a result, Tranglo recorded a net income of $1.53 million for the first nine months of 2024, up 13.2% year over year. With an approach that delivers maximum value to both our customers and shareholders, we’re confident of maintaining our robust growth trajectory in the increasingly competitive digital remittance landscape.”\n\nRonnie Hui, Chief Executive Officer of CURRENC, added, \"We made significant strides in consolidating our operations and enhancing our financial performance this quarter. While headquarters expenses relating to our merger with INFINT SPAC, including $13.1 million in recognition of incentive shares granted to employees and $1 million in recognition of shares granted to Roth for their capital market advisory services, drove increases in general and administrative expenses to $19.1 million for the third quarter and $30.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, these are non-recurring costs that have positioned us for ongoing growth as a publicly-listed digital remittance frontrunner. Looking ahead, we remain dedicated to optimizing our cost structures and leveraging the strengths of our core remittance business to enhance profitability and shareholder value.”\n\n_____________________________1 CURRENC divested TNG Asia and GEA in August 2024 and July 2024, respectively. As such, from the fourth quarter of 2024 onward, only Tranglo’s (digital remittance and global airtime transfer businesses) and WalletKu’s (Indonesian airtime business) results will be consolidated and reported in the Company’s financial statements.2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) income tax expense, (ii) amortization of intangible assets, (iii) depreciation of property, plant and equipment, (v) interest expenses, net. Please refer to the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for details. 3 The Company's core businesses include Tranglo and WalletKu and exclude TNG Asia and GEA, divested in August 2024 and July 2024, respectively. Other services are also excluded.4 This amount includes $13.1 million in expenses recognized for incentive shares granted to employees upon the completion of the merger with INFINT SPAC in August 2024, and $1 million in expenses recognized for shares granted to Roth for their services as CURRENC’s Capital Market Advisor.5 The figures presented herein solely represent revenue from the Company's core businesses, Tranglo and WalletKu, and exclude revenues from TNG Asia and GEA, divested in August 2024 and July 2024, respectively. Additionally, revenues from contracts with customers for other services are not included.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, it uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as described below, to understand and evaluate its core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. CURRENC believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure eliminates the impact of items that CURRENC does not consider indicative of the performance of its business. While CURRENC believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**About CURRENC Group Inc.** CURRENC Group Inc.
