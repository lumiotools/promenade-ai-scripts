CORPORATION\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of Kopin Corporation as of September 28, 2024 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 are unaudited and include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the\nresults of operations for the periods then ended. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and\nnotes thereto, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period\nare not necessarily indicative of the results of the Company’s operations for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year. As used in this report, the terms \"we”, \"us”, \"our”,\n\"Kopin” and the \"Company” mean Kopin Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include the accounts of Kopin\nCorporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of $19.7 million and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2023.\nThe Company incurred a net loss of $41.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of $12.6 million. This net loss of $41.9 million\nincludes an estimated $24.8 million of possible damages related to a jury verdict which is explained below. In addition, the Company has experienced a significant decline in its cash\nand cash equivalents and marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding operating losses. As described in Note 14 Litigation, on April 22,\n2024, a jury verdict was entered against the Company awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary\ndamages. On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the\ndisgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any\nproducts that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. While no final judgment has been\nissued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after briefing on the issues. Final briefings on\nthe motions were made by the parties on October 29, 2024. The Company is also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment. The Company had $37.3 million of cash\nand cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at September 28, 2024.\nThe Company has historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. The Company’s current strategy is to continue to invest in its\nbusiness and raise additional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings and private placements of its common stock, preferred stock offerings,\ncollaborations and licensing arrangements and issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, the Company plans to\nstrategically manage its uncommitted spending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative\nexpenditures which could include minimizing staff costs. The Company may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There are inherent uncertainties associated with\nfundraising activities and activities to manage our uncommitted spending and the successful execution of these activities may not be within the Company’s control. There are no\nassurances that such additional funding will be obtained and that the Company will succeed in its future operations. If the Company is unable to achieve positive cash flows and\nprofitability in the foreseeable future, cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic plan, or the recommended disgorgement and exemplary damages are\nnot significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. There is\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n8\n2. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) Number 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures” (\"ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires more disaggregated income tax disclosures, including additional information in the rate\nreconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025. Early adoption\nis permitted, and guidance should be applied prospectively, with an option to apply guidance retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of\nASU 2023-09 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU Number 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (\"ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-\n07 requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker(s) that are included within each reported measure of\nsegment profit or loss. The guidance also expands disclosure requirements for interim periods, as well as requires disclosure of other segment items, including the title and position\nof the entity’s chief operations decision maker(s). ASU 2023-07 will become effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024, and for interim periods starting\nin the Company’s first quarter of 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and guidance is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of ASU 2023-07 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n3. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash of approximately $1.1 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024, and represents cash deposited by the Company into a\nseparate account and designated as collateral for a standby letter of credit in the same amount in accordance with a contractual agreement with a vendor. The restricted cash\nbalance at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 is invested in certificates of deposit and money market funds. The restricted cash balance that is invested in certificates of\ndeposit is classified as marketable securities.\nMarketable securities consist primarily of commercial paper, medium-term corporate notes, and U.S. Government and agency-backed securities. The Company classifies these\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at fair value in \"Marketable securities, at fair value.” The Company records the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on\nmarketable securities in the results of operations.\nThe Company uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining cost and calculating realized gains and losses with respect to marketable securities. The gross\ngains and losses realized related to sales and maturities of marketable securities were not material during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023.\nInvestments in available-for-sale marketable securities were as follows at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023:\nAmortized Cost Unrealized Losses Fair Value\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities $17,256,314 $ 4,500,030 $ (1,609) $ (25,655) $17,254,705 $ 4,474,375\nCorporate debt 4,954,096 7,750,174 3,442 (32,549) 4,957,538 7,717,625\nTotal $22,210,410 $ 12,250,204 $ 1,833 $ (58,204) $22,212,243 $ 12,192,000\nThe contractual maturity of the Company’s marketable securities was as follows at September 28, 2024:\nLess than One to\nOne year Five years Total\nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities $ 16,758,720 $ 495,985 $ 17,254,705\nCorporate debt 4,957,538 — 4,957,538\nTotal $ 21,716,258 $ 495,985 $ 22,212,243\n9\n4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFinancial instruments are categorized as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based upon the method by which their fair value is computed. An investment is categorized as Level 1 when\nits fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An investment is\ncategorized as Level 2 if its fair market value is based on quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not\nactive, based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, or derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. An investment is\ncategorized as Level 3 if its fair value is based on assumptions developed by the Company about what a market participant would use in pricing the assets.\nThe following table details the fair value measurements of the Company’s financial assets:\nFair Value Measurement at September 28, 2024 Using:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nCash equivalents $ 12,279,360 $ 12,279,360 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities 17,254,705 15,758,720 1,495,985 —\nCorporate debt 4,957,538 4,957,538 — —\nEquity Investments 1,097,440 223,187 — 874,253\n$ 35,589,043 $ 33,218,805 $ 1,495,985 $ 874,253\nFair Value Measurement at December 30, 2023 Using:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nCash equivalents $ 5,079,605 $ 5,079,605 $ — $ —\nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities 4,474,375 — 4,474,375 —\nCorporate debt 7,717,625 7,717,625 — —\nEquity Investments 4,688,522 174,178 — 4,514,344\n$ 21,960,127 $ 12,971,408 $ 4,474,375 $ 4,514,344\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. If\naccrued liabilities were carried at fair value, these would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nMarketable Securities\nCorporate debt consists of floating rate notes with a maturity that may be over multiple years but has interest rates that are reset every three months. US government and\nagency-backed securities consist of high-quality U.S. Government and government-backed (e.g., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) securities. The\nCompany validates the fair market values of the financial instruments above by using discounted cash flow models, obtaining independent pricing of the securities or through the\nuse of a model that incorporates the three-month interest rate, the credit default swap rate of the issuer and the bid and ask price spread of the same or similar investments which\nare traded on several markets.\nEquity Investments\nThe Company has an investment in RealWear Inc. (RealWear) which had been valued at $5.2 million. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received shares valued at\napproximately $0.4 million as payment of royalties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity\ntransaction, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the value of the investment to $2.5 million. In both the second and third quarters\nof 2024, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity transaction, and as a result, recorded impairment charges of $0.7 million and $1.1\nmillion, respectively, to reduce the value of the investment to $0.7 million. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned an approximate 2.8% interest in this investment.\nThe equity investments categorized as Level 1 at September 28, 2024 were the Company’s equity investments in publicly traded companies that met the categorization\nrequirements for Level 1 classification.\nThe equity investments that were not remeasured to fair value and therefore did not meet the Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 classification requirements had a value of $2.0 million\nat September 28, 2024.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Level 3 equity investments include the Company’s investment in RealWear of $0.7 million and the value of an additional equity investment.\n10\n5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 10,248,935 $ 10,731,036\nLess — allowance for credit losses (1,015,000) (1,025,000)\nTotal $ 9,233,935 $ 9,706,036\nChanges to the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were as follows:\nBalance, December 30, 2023 $ 1,025,000\nAdditions 24,000\nWrite-offs (34,000)\nBalance, September 28, 2024 $ 1,015,000\n6. INVENTORY\nInventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consist of the following at September 28,\n2024 and December 30, 2023:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nRaw materials $ 3,990,155 $ 4,785,197\nWork-in-process 1,728,166 2,018,421\nFinished goods 837,038 798,188\nTotal $ 6,555,359 $ 7,601,806\n7. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period less any unvested restricted shares.\nDiluted net loss per share is calculated using weighted-average shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares, less weighted-average shares reacquired during the period.\nThe net outstanding shares are adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Company’s common stock equivalents, which consist of\nunvested restricted stock, and outstanding warrants.\nThe following were not included in weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted because they are anti-dilutive:\nThree Months Three Months Nine months Nine months\nEnded Ended ended ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNon-vested restricted common stock 5,510,914 3,948,417 5,510,914 3,948,417\n11\n8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nRegistered sale of equity securities\nOn September 23, 2024, the Company sold 37,550,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering\nprice of $0.64 per pre-funded warrant and received gross proceeds of $27.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.8\nmillion. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded\nwarrant.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company sold 2,405,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of $1.5 million.\nDuring the three months ended March 30, 2024, the Company sold 3,080,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $7,466,755 (average of $2.42 per share) before\ndeducting broker expenses paid by the Company of approximately $0.2 million, pursuant to the Company’s then effective At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, dated\nas of March 5, 2021 (the \"ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\"Stifel”), as agent. The ATM Agreement terminated in the three months ended March\n30, 2024.\nOn January 27, 2023, the Company sold 17,000,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering\nprice of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $22.9 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.5 million. The\noffering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.\nNon-Vested Restricted Common Stock\nThe fair value of non-vested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted\ncommon stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for one, two or four years (the vesting period) and in\ncertain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or the Company’s stock achieving a certain price. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that solely require\nthe recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For non-vested restricted common stock\nawards that require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company\ndetermines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the anticipated\nservice period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\nThe Company granted 4,226,320 and 3,296,051 restricted stock units to its employees, executives and the Board of Directors in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. For fiscal year 2024, 1,137,970 shares are part of an incentive program that would vest upon the successful achievement of certain fiscal year 2024\nmilestones. Through September 28, 2024, 99,279 shares were earned upon the achievement of milestones, 343,631 were forfeited for failure to meet milestones, and 695,060 may still\nbe earned for achieving milestones in 2024. The fair value of the restricted stock units was based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The time-\nbased shares are expensed over the service period and the milestone-based shares are expensed based upon the probability of achievement.\nRestricted stock activity for the nine month period ended September 28, 2024 was as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nShares Fair Value\nBalance, December 30, 2023 1,931,767 $ 1.65\nGranted 4,226,320 1.30\nForfeited (399,644) 2.50\nVested (247,529) 2.00\nBalance, September 28, 2024 5,510,914 1.30\n12\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense within each of the categories below as it relates to non-vested restricted common stock awards for the\nthree and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (no tax benefits were recognized):\nThree Months Three Months Nine months Nine months\nEnded Ended ended ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCost of product revenues $ 368,312 $ 311,455 $ 857,236 $ 764,996\nResearch and development 308,792 214,320 569,701 553,488\nSelling, general and administrative 535,842 432,560 1,197,355 1,025,298\nTotal $ 1,212,946 $ 958,335 $ 2,624,292 $ 2,343,782\nUnrecognized compensation expense for non-vested restricted common stock as of September 28, 2024 totaled $4.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted\naverage period of approximately two years.\n9. ACCRUED WARRANTY\nThe Company typically warrants its products against defect for 12 to 18 months, however, for certain products a customer may purchase an extended warranty. A provision for\nestimated future costs and estimated returns for credit relating to such warranty is recorded in the period when product is shipped and revenue is recognized and is updated as\nadditional information becomes available. The Company’s estimate of future costs to satisfy warranty obligations is based primarily on historical warranty expense experienced and\na provision for potential future product failures. Changes in the accrued warranty for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were as follows:\nBalance, December 30, 2023 $ 2,160,000\nAdditions 700,000\nClaims (185,000)\nBalance, September 28, 2024 $ 2,675,000\nExtended Warranties\nDeferred revenue represents the purchase of extended warranties by the Company’s customers. The Company recognizes revenue from an extended warranty on the straight-\nline method over the life of the extended warranty, which is typically 12 to 15 months beyond the standard 12 to 18-month warranty. The Company classifies the current portion of\ndeferred revenue under Other accrued liabilities in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 28, 2024, the Company had less than $0.1 million of deferred revenue\nrelated to extended warranties.\n13\n10. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded\na provision for income taxes of less than $0.1 million and approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 28, 2024,\nthe Company has available for tax purposes U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs”) of approximately $122.7 million expiring 2024 through 2038 and $107.8 million\nthat have an unlimited carryover period. The Company has recognized a full valuation allowance on its domestic and certain foreign net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty\nof the realization of such assets. The Company recognizes both accrued interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions related to intercompany loan interest and\npotential transfer pricing exposure related to its foreign subsidiaries.\n11. CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue\nrecognized from customer arrangements, including licensing, exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Amounts\nmay not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. The Company classifies the noncurrent portion of contract assets under Other assets\nin its condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of cost incurred and deferred revenue.\nNet contract assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023 $ Change % Change\nContract assets and unbilled receivables —current $ 8,274,538 $ 3,409,809 $ 4,864,729 143%\nContract liabilities and billings in excess of\nrevenues earned (268,468) (916,826) 648,358 (71)%\nContract liabilities—noncurrent — (23,198) 23,198 (100)%\nNet contract assets $ 8,006,070 $ 2,469,785 $ 5,536,285 224%\nThe $5.5 million increase in the Company’s net contract assets at September 28, 2024 as compared to December 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in amounts owed from\ncustomers for whom we produce products for defense applications.\nIn the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of less than $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to its contract liabilities\nat December 30, 2023. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of less than $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to its\ncontract liabilities at December 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not recognize impairment losses on its contract assets in the three or nine months ended September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company’s revenue recognition related to performance obligations that were satisfied at a point in time and over time were as follows:\nThree months Three months Nine months Nine months\nended ended ended ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nPoint in time 11% 24% 16% 27%\nOver time 89% 76% 84% 73%\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential\norders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ”)). As of September 28, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to\nremaining performance obligations was $25.4 million which the Company expects to recognize over the next 12 months. The remaining performance obligations represent amounts\nto be earned under government contracts, which are subject to cancellation.\n14\n12. LEASES\nThe Company enters into operating leases primarily for: real estate, including for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration and sales facilities, and information\ntechnology (\"IT”) equipment. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company did not have any finance leases. Approximately all of its future lease commitments, and\nrelated lease liability, relate to the Company’s real estate leases. Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nThree months Three months Nine months Nine months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 218,348 $ 216,119 $ 651,718 $ 648,545\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company’s future lease payments under non-cancellable leases were as follows:\n2024 (excluding the nine months ended September 28, 2024) $ 212,013\n2025 766,014\n2026 732,610\n2027 669,255\n2028 201,333\nTotal future lease payments 2,581,225\nLess imputed interest (293,289)\nTotal $ 2,287,936\nThe Company’s lease liabilities recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2024 were as follows:\nSeptember 28, 2024\nOperating lease liabilities–current $ 653,546\nOperating lease liabilities–noncurrent 1,634,390\nTotal lease liabilities $ 2,287,936\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 649,276 $ 741,757\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted Average Discount Rate–Operating Leases 6.80% 6.06%\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term–Operating Leases (in years) 3.38 4.11\n15\n13. SEGMENTS AND DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nThe Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine if any changes have occurred that\nwould affect its reportable segments. The Company reports under one segment, as its Chief Executive Officer, who is its chief operating decision maker (\"CODM”), reviews results\non a total company basis.\nTotal long-lived assets by country at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were:\nTotal Long-lived Assets (in thousands) September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nUnited States $ 4,199 $ 4,424\nUnited Kingdom 123 244\nTotal $ 4,322 $ 4,668\nThe Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location and by display application, as it believes this best depicts how the nature,\namount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company derived its sales from the following geographies:\nThree months Three months Nine months Nine months\nended ended ended ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(In thousands, except\npercentages) Revenue % of Total Revenue % of Total Revenue % of Total Revenue % of Total\nUnited States $ 12,612 95% $ 9,879 94% $ 33,352 93% $ 27,788 88%\nOther Americas — — — — 5 — 5 —\nTotal Americas 12,612 95 9,879 94 33,357 93 27,793 88\nAsia - Pacific 382 3 363 3 1,632 5 2,956 9\nEurope 326 2 356 3 700 2 1,068 3\nTotal Revenues $ 13,320 100% $ 10,598 100% $ 35,689 100% $ 31,817 100%\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company derived its sales from the following display applications:\nThree months Three months Nine months\nended ended Nine months ended ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDefense $ 10,434 $ 4,996 $ 29,095 $ 16,482\nIndustrial 489 310 1,883 2,118\nConsumer — 200 25 573\nR&D 2,268 4,956 4,338 11,737\nLicense and royalties 129 136 348 907\nTotal Revenues $ 13,320 $ 10,598 $ 35,689 $ 31,817\n16\n14. LITIGATION\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not\npossible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\nBlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Company breached a contract\nbetween it and BlueRadios concerning a joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless\ntechnology referred to as \"Golden-i,” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and\nmisappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios\nfurther alleged that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the\nCompany as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’\nemployees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-\npayment of engineering retainer fees.\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the\nCompany filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and\nreplies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the\nCompany’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, the claim for punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications and by\ndenying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. The Court also ordered discovery reopened for certain limited purposes. A trial date was\nset by the Court for January 22 to February 5, 2024 but then re-scheduled for March 20 to April 16. On Monday, April 22, 2024, after a four week trial, a jury verdict was entered\nfinding for BlueRadios and awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment\nhas been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after post-trial briefing. On May 22,\n2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary\ndamages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate\nBlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on June 26, 2024. On\nSeptember 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios’ claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in BlueRadios, Inc.\nv. Hamilton, Brook, Smith & Reynolds, P.C., No. 1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded on October 29, 2024. The Company\nis currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued $5.1 million in damages as well as $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was\nrecorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\n15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company may from time to time enter into agreements with stockholders, affiliates and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and\nsoftware industries as part of its business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies the Company needs\nto purchase from affiliates to enhance its product offering.\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon\nTechnology, Inc. (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with its Organic Light Emitting Technology,\ntransferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. The technology\nlicense agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to LST if LST achieves certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology.\nTo the extent LST makes improvements to the technology licensed from Kopin, Kopin will receive a license for these improvements for certain markets. Kopin is not obligated to\nprovide any additional funding support to LST. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST.\nThe Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President and CEO and former\nChairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer terminated their\nemployment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is the Founder of LST. As a result of this transaction, in 2022 the\nCompany wrote off the two operating lease assets associated with facilities used for the development of the Company’s organic light emitting diode (OLED) products. The\nCompany has recorded its investment in LST at $0 as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had the following transactions with related parties:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales Purchases Sales Purchases\nRealWear, Inc. $ 94,854 — $ 135,918 $ —\nHMDmd, Inc. 76,918 — 349,420 —\nSolos Technology 33,288 — — —\nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. 924 6,650 — 208,933\n$ 205,984 6,650 $ 485,338 $ 208,933\nNine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales Purchases Sales Purchases\nRealWear, Inc. $ 311,994 10,550 $ 905,564 $ —\nHMDmd, Inc. 299,177 — 852,175 —\nVuzix Corp — 11,905 — —\nSolos Technology 33,288 — — —\nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. 3,158 170,850 — 416,988\n$ 647,617 193,305 $ 1,757,739 $ 416,988\nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had the following receivables from and payables to related parties:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nReceivables Payables Receivables Payables\nRealWear, Inc. $ 94,854 $ — $ 94,902 $ —\nHMDmd, Inc. 101,922 — 15,000 —\nSolos Technology 33,288 — — —\nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. 41 — 35,013 97,600\n$ 230,105 $ — $ 144,915 $ 97,600\n17\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”),\nand Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), which are subject to the safe harbor created by such sections.

We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such \"forward-looking statements,” which speak only\nas of the date made, and advise readers that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates, and\nassumptions by us that are difficult to predict. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or\nimplied by, such forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, and whether made by us or on our behalf, are expressly qualified by\nthese cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements that may accompany the forward-looking statements. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any\nforward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may otherwise be required by the federal securities laws.\nWe have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements. Such factors may\nbe in addition to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors;” Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations; and other parts of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. These factors include: our ability to source semiconductor\ncomponents and other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products; our ability to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively or successfully;\nour ability to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business; our ability to invest in research and development to achieve profitability even during\nperiods when we are not profitable; our ability to continue to introduce new products in our target markets; our ability to generate revenue growth and positive cash flow, and\nreach profitability; the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its effects on the price of our products in foreign markets; the impact of new regulations and customer demands\nrelating to conflict minerals; our ability to obtain a competitive advantage in the wearable technologies market through our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and\nnon-patented know-how; our ability to grow within our targeted markets; the importance of small form factor displays in the development of defense, consumer, and industrial\nproducts such as thermal weapon sights, safety equipment, virtual and augmented reality gaming, training and simulation products and metrology tools; the suitability of our\nproperties for our needs for the foreseeable future; our expectation not to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future and to retain earnings for the development of our\nbusinesses; our need to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability; and our expectation that if we do not achieve and maintain positive cash flow and\nprofitability; our financial condition will ultimately be materially adversely affected, and we will be required to reduce expenses, including our investments in research and\ndevelopment or raise additional capital and our ability to support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months through our available cash resources.\nOverview\nWe are a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of miniature displays and optical lenses (our \"components”) for sale as individual displays, components, modules or\nhigher-level subassemblies. We also license our intellectual property through technology license agreements. Our component products are used in highly demanding high-\nresolution portable defense, enterprise and consumer electronic applications, training and simulation equipment and 3D metrology equipment. Our products enable our customers\nto develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications.\n18\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.\nResults of Operations\nOur interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of such results may not be indicative of our future operating results. Additionally, we use a fiscal\ncalendar, that may result in differences in the number of workdays in the current and comparable prior interim periods and could affect period-to-period comparisons. The following\ndiscussion of comparative results of operations among periods should be viewed in this context.\nRevenues. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our revenues by display application, which include product sales and amounts\nearned from research and development contracts (\"R&D”), were as follows:\nThree months Three months Nine months Nine months\nended ended ended ended\n(In thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nDefense $ 10,434 $ 4,996 $ 29,095 $ 16,482\nIndustrial 489 310 1,883 2,118\nConsumer — 200 25 573\nR&D 2,268 4,956 4,338 11,737\nLicense and royalties 129 136 348 907\nTotal Revenues $ 13,320 $ 10,598 $ 35,689 $ 31,817\nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. The increase in Defense applications\nrevenues in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in revenues from products\nused in thermal weapon sights and to a lesser extent due to an increase in revenues from sales of products used in pilot helmets. The increase in Defense applications revenues in\nthe nine months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in revenues from products used in thermal\nweapon sights partially offset by a decline in revenues from sales of products used in pilot helmets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans on devoting production\nresources to provide units that customers have made warranty claims on, which may impact our fourth quarter revenues.\nIndustrial applications revenue represents customers who purchase our display products for use in 3D metrology equipment and headsets used for applications in\nmanufacturing, distribution, and public safety. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology\nmachines for quality control purposes. The increase in Industrial applications revenues for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in sales of products for 3D metrology. The decrease in Industrial applications revenues for the nine months ended September\n28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of products for 3D metrology.\nOur displays for Consumer applications are used primarily in thermal imaging products in recreational rifles, first person viewers, and hand-held scopes. The decrease in\nConsumer applications revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to\na decrease in sales for hand-held thermal viewers.\nR&D revenues decreased in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreases in funding for\nU.S. defense programs. R&D revenues decreased in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a\ndecrease in funding for U.S. defense programs as certain programs were completed and customers are evaluating the results and certain programs transitioned to production\nprograms. Included in R&D revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is approximately $400,000 related to OLED development programs with a consumer customer.\nInternational revenues represented 5% and 7% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 6% and 12% of total revenues for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We categorize our revenues as either domestic or international based upon the delivery destination of our\nproduct. For example, if the customer is located in Asia or if a U.S. customer has its Asian contract manufacturer order product from us and we deliver the product to Asia, then we\ncategorize both of these sales as international. In addition, if we earn royalties on sales from a customer, the royalties are categorized as domestic or international based on how the\nproduct revenues are categorized. The decrease in international revenues was a result of a decrease in sales of our OLED products and our display products for 3D metrology\napplications. Our international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. currency. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our\nproducts in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors’ products that are denominated in local currencies, which could lead to a reduction\nin sales or profitability in those foreign markets. We have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations, such as purchasing hedging instruments with\nrespect to such fluctuations, because of the historically stable exchange rate between the British Pound Sterling (the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary) and the U.S.\ndollar. Foreign currency translation impact on our results, if material, is described in further detail under \"Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”\nsection below.\n19\nCost of Product Revenues. Cost of product revenues, which is comprised of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products for the\nthree and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nThree months ended Three months ended Nine months ended Nine months ended\n(In thousands, except for percentages) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCost of product revenues $ 8,317 $ 5,438 $ 25,544 $ 17,759\nCost of product revenues as a % of net product revenues 76% 99% 82% 93%\nThe decrease in cost of product revenue as a percent of net product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in expected program costs as a result of lower estimate of rework costs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans\non devoting production resources to provide units for which customers have made warranty claims. As the Company has already accrued an estimate of the cost to repair these\nunits, we do not expect this to have a material impact on Cost of product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues.\nDuring 2023, our manufacturing was impacted by a shortage of several semiconductor components from our normal vendors that are necessary to manufacture our products.\nFor some components we were able to identify and use other sources for the components but for some components primarily used in defense related products, we were not able to\navail ourselves of alternate components because their use would have required a requalification of our product by our customer. While the shortage of certain semiconductor\ncomponents situation has improved, occasional disruptions do occur which may impact our ability to ship product.\nResearch and Development. R&D expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs and programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the\nU.S. Government and commercial partners. R&D costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of display\nproducts, and overhead. In fiscal year 2024, our R&D expenditures are related to our display products, overlay weapon sights and OLED display technologies. Funded and internal\nR&D expenses are combined in research and development expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nThree months ended Three months ended Nine months ended Nine months ended\n(In thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nFunded $ 1,123 $ 2,346 $ 2,598 $ 6,179\nInternal 1,474 744 3,939 2,355\nTotal research and development expense $ 2,597 $ 3,090 $ 6,537 $ 8,534\nFunded R&D expense for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to\ndecreased spending on U.S. defense programs and programs previously in development were completed. Internal R&D expense increased due to an increase in display\ndevelopment costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative (\"S,G&A”) expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and\nrelated expenses, and administrative and general corporate expenses. S,G&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as\nfollows:\nThree months ended Three months ended Nine months ended Nine months ended\n(In thousands, except for percentages) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSelling, general and administration expense $ 5,207 $ 4,799 $ 19,707 $ 15,913\nSelling, general and administration expense as a % of revenues 39% 45% 55% 50%\n20\nS,G&A increased for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal fees of $0.5\nmillion, partially offset by a decrease in public relation expense of $0.1 million. S,G&A increased for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal fees of $3.8 million partially offset by a decrease in credit loss expense of $0.7 million.\nLitigation Damages. Litigation damages were accrued as a result of the April 22, 2024 jury verdict that was entered against us, awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages\nas well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages.\nOther (Expense) Income, net. Other (expense) income, net, is primarily composed of interest income, foreign currency transactions, losses on fair value recording of\ninvestments and remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our U.K.-based subsidiary and other non-operating income items. Other (expense) income, net, for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\nThree months ended Three months ended Nine months ended Nine months ended\n(In thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOther (expense) income, net $ (535) $ 317 $ (907) $ (2,752)\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded foreign currency gains of $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, as compared to foreign\ncurrency losses of less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other (expense) income, net for the nine months\nended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 includes $1.6 million and $3.3 million of impairment losses on equity investments, respectively.\nTax Provision. We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. We recorded a provision for\nincome taxes of less than $0.1 million and approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Loss. We incurred net losses of $3.5 million and $41.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, compared to net losses of $2.5\nmillion and $13.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in net loss during the three months ended September 28, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an improvement of gross margins and foreign currency gains partially offset by an increase in legal\nexpense. The increase in the net loss during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to accrued\nlitigation damages and legal fees.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $37.3 million and $17.9 million, respectively, and\nworking capital of $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to an equity raise of $25.2\nmillion in the third quarter of 2024 in addition to the sale of common stock of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 which was partially offset by cash used in operations of $12.6\nmillion. Our cash and cash equivalents and liquidity could be adversely affected by any amounts that become payable in connection with any adverse results from any litigation\nwe are, or may become, involved in.\n21\nOn September 23, 2024, we sold 37,550,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of\n$0.64 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $27.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the us of $1.8 million. The offering price of\nthe pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.\nOn September 30, 2024, we sold 2,405,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of $1.5 million.\nDuring the three months ended March 30, 2024, we sold 3,080,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $7,466,755 (average of $2.42 per share) before deducting\nbroker expenses paid by us of approximately $0.2 million, pursuant to our then effective At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2021 (the \"ATM\nAgreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\"Stifel”), as agent. The ATM Agreement terminated in the three months ended March 30, 2024.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses of $19.7 million and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2023. We\nincurred a net loss of $41.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of $12.6 million. In addition, we have experienced a\nsignificant decline in its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding operating losses. As described in\nNote 14 Litigation, on April 22, 2024, a jury verdict was entered against us awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement\nand exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the\nfinal amount after briefing on the issues. We have argued that the damages, disgorgement and exemplary damages should be reduced or eliminated. Final briefing on the issued\noccurred on October 29, 2024. We are also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment. We had $37.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and\nmarketable securities at September 28, 2024.\nWe have had historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. Our current strategy is to continue to invest in its business and raise\nadditional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings and private placements of our common stock, preferred stock offerings, collaborations and licensing\narrangements and issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, we plan to strategically manage its uncommitted\nspending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative expenditures which could include\nminimizing staff costs. We may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There are inherent uncertainties associated with fundraising activities and activities to\nmanage our uncommitted spending and the successful execution of these activities may not be within our control. There are no assurances that such additional funding will be\nobtained and that we will succeed in our future operations. If we are unable to achieve positive cash flows and profitability in the foreseeable future or cannot successfully raise\nadditional capital and implement its strategic plan, our liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. Unless the recommended\ndisgorgement and exemplary damages are significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nDomestic locations $ 37,142,691 $ 17,725,979\nInternational locations 38,225 95,547\nSubtotal cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities held in U.S.\ndollars 37,180,916 17,821,526\nCash and cash equivalents held in other currencies and converted to U.S. dollars 111,920 81,159\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities $ 37,292,836 $ 17,902,685\nWe have no plans to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiary Forth Dimension Displays, Ltd. (\"FDD”), and, as such, we have not recorded any\ndeferred tax liability with respect to such cash.\nWe expect to expend between $1.0 million and $2.0 million on capital expenditures in 2024.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n22\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe invest our excess cash in high-quality U.S. Government, government-backed (e.g., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) and corporate debt\ninstruments, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrealized gain or loss on debt\nsecurities. We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ financial position, results of operations, and\ntransaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows related to business activities in Europe, and remeasurement of U.S. dollars to the British pound,\nthe functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries. We are also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials, which are in U.S. dollars, but the\nprice on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations or investments is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operation. Our portfolio of marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments\nmay be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. We use silicon wafers but do not enter into forward or futures hedging contracts to\nmitigate against risks related to the price of silicon.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 28, 2024, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 28, 2024, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”). The term \"disclosure\ncontrols and procedures” means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nprincipal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that\nevaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules\nand forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n23\nPart II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not\npossible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\nBlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Company breached a contract\nbetween it and BlueRadios concerning a joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless\ntechnology referred to as \"Golden-i,” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and\nmisappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios\nfurther alleged that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the\nCompany as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’\nemployees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-\npayment of engineering retainer fees.\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the\nCompany filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and\nreplies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the\nCompany’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, the claim for punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications and by\ndenying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. The Court also ordered discovery reopened for certain limited purposes. A trial date was\nset by the Court for January 22 to February 5, 2024 but then re-scheduled for March 20 to April 16. On Monday, April 22, 2024, after a four week trial, a jury verdict was entered\nfinding for BlueRadios and awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment\nhas been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after post-trial briefing. On May 22,\n2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary\ndamages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate\nBlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on June 26, 2024. On\nSeptember 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios’ claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in BlueRadios, Inc.\nv. Hamilton, Brook, Smith & Reynolds, P.C., No. 1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded on October 29, 2024. The Company\nis currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued $5.1 million in damages as well as $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was\nrecorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\n24\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result, the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. There have been no material changes in the assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, except for the risk factors noted below.\nWe may not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our\nCommon Stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock’s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. On October 14, 2024, we\nreceived a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \"Staff”) of Nasdaq, indicating that our common stock was subject to potential delisting from The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket because, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued\nlisting on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Requirement”). Nasdaq stated in its letter that in accordance with the Nasdaq\nListing Rules, we have been provided an initial period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until April 14, 2025 (the \"Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with the Bid\nPrice Requirement. The letter states that Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Bid Price Requirement if at any time before the\nCompliance Date, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To\nqualify, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market,\nwith the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second 180 calendar day\ncompliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date and is not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff\nwill provide written notification to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price\nRequirement. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance or otherwise maintain compliance with any of the other listing requirements.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our\ncommon stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC\nBulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in\nour coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional\ncapital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nSuch a delisting would also likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish\nto do so. In the event of a delisting, we may take actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any\nsuch action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock\nfrom dropping below the Bid Price Requirement or prevent future non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements.\nOngoing litigation may result in substantial financial and operational impacts.\nWe are currently involved in litigation related to an alleged breach of contract, which is being pursued by BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”). This litigation could lead to a final\njudgment impacting our financial and operational results. A jury has already awarded $5.1 million in damages as well as recommended $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary\ndamages related to this matter. These damages have been accrued, however the liability and or possible future payout could increase or decrease as a result of the final judgement\nissued by the court.\nIn addition, on May 22, 2024, we filed a Motion for Judgement as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as submissions arguing that the disgorgement\nand exemplary damages should not be awarded. There is no guarantee that these will be granted. Furthermore, on the same day, BlueRadios filed a motion seeking a permanent\ninjunction prohibiting us from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, along with requiring us to pay $10 million in pre-judgment interest and over $10\nmillion in attorneys’ fees and costs. Final briefing on the motions occurred on October 18, 2024. If the court rules in favor of BlueRadios on these motions, we may face substantial\nadditional damages beyond those already accrued.\nIf we choose to appeal, there is no assurance that such an appeal would be successful. An unfavorable outcome could significantly affect our business operations and limit\nour ability to generate future revenues.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nWe did not sell any securities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 that were not registered under the Securities Act.\nItem 6.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION**\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of Kopin Corporation as of September 28, 2024 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are unaudited and include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the periods then ended. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of the Company’s operations for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year. As used in this report, the terms \"we”, \"us”, \"our”, \"Kopin” and the \"Company” mean Kopin Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include the accounts of Kopin Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n_Going Concern_\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of $19.7 million and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2023. The Company incurred a net loss of $41.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of $12.6 million. This net loss of $41.9 million includes an estimated $24.8 million of possible damages related to a jury verdict which is explained below. In addition, the Company has experienced a significant decline in its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding operating losses. As described in Note 14 Litigation, on April 22, 2024, a jury verdict was entered against the Company awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after briefing on the issues. Final briefings on the motions were made by the parties on October 29, 2024. The Company is also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment. The Company had $37.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at September 28, 2024.\n\nThe Company has historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. The Company’s current strategy is to continue to invest in its business and raise additional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings and private placements of its common stock, preferred stock offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements and issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, the Company plans to strategically manage its uncommitted spending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative expenditures which could include minimizing staff costs. The Company may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There are inherent uncertainties associated with fundraising activities and activities to manage our uncommitted spending and the successful execution of these activities may not be within the Company’s control. There are no assurances that such additional funding will be obtained and that the Company will succeed in its future operations. If the Company is unable to achieve positive cash flows and profitability in the foreseeable future, cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic plan, or the recommended disgorgement and exemplary damages are not significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**2.

ASU 2023-09 requires more disaggregated income tax disclosures, including additional information in the rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and guidance should be applied prospectively, with an option to apply guidance retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU Number 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (\"ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker(s) that are included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The guidance also expands disclosure requirements for interim periods, as well as requires disclosure of other segment items, including the title and position of the entity’s chief operations decision maker(s). ASU 2023-07 will become effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024, and for interim periods starting in the Company’s first quarter of 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and guidance is required to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n**3. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES**\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n\nRestricted cash of approximately $1.1 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024, and represents cash deposited by the Company into a separate account and designated as collateral for a standby letter of credit in the same amount in accordance with a contractual agreement with a vendor. The restricted cash balance at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 is invested in certificates of deposit and money market funds. The restricted cash balance that is invested in certificates of deposit is classified as marketable securities.\n\nMarketable securities consist primarily of commercial paper, medium-term corporate notes, and U.S. Government and agency-backed securities. The Company classifies these marketable securities as available-for-sale at fair value in \"Marketable securities, at fair value.” The Company records the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on marketable securities in the results of operations.\n\nThe Company uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining cost and calculating realized gains and losses with respect to marketable securities. The gross gains and losses realized related to sales and maturities of marketable securities were not material during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\nInvestments in available-for-sale marketable securities were as follows at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES\n\nAmortized Cost | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value  \n---|---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities | $| 17,256,314 | $| 4,500,030 | $| (1,609| ) | $| (25,655| ) | $| 17,254,705 | $| 4,474,375  \nCorporate debt | 4,954,096 | 7,750,174 | 3,442 | (32,549| ) | 4,957,538 | 7,717,625  \nTotal | $| 22,210,410 | $| 12,250,204 | $| 1,833 | $| (58,204| ) | $| 22,212,243 | $| 12,192,000  \n  \nThe contractual maturity of the Company’s marketable securities was as follows at September 28, 2024:\n\nSCHEDULE OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES\n\nLess than One year | One to Five years | Total  \n---|---|---  \nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities | **$** | **16,758,720 ** | **$** | **495,985 ** | **$** | **17,254,705 **  \nCorporate debt | **4,957,538 ** | **—** | **4,957,538 **  \nTotal | **$** | **21,716,258 ** | **$** | **495,985 ** | **$** | **22,212,243 **  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \n**4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nFinancial instruments are categorized as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based upon the method by which their fair value is computed. An investment is categorized as Level 1 when its fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An investment is categorized as Level 2 if its fair market value is based on quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, or derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. An investment is categorized as Level 3 if its fair value is based on assumptions developed by the Company about what a market participant would use in pricing the assets.\n\nThe following table details the fair value measurements of the Company’s financial assets:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nFair Value Measurement at September 28, 2024 Using:  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 12,279,360 | $| 12,279,360 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities | 17,254,705 | 15,758,720 | 1,495,985 | —  \nCorporate debt | 4,957,538 | 4,957,538 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 1,097,440 | 223,187 | — | 874,253  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 35,589,043 | $| 33,218,805 | $| 1,495,985 | $| 874,253  \nFair Value Measurement at December 30, 2023 Using:  \n---  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 5,079,605 | $| 5,079,605 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency-backed securities | 4,474,375 | — | 4,474,375 | —  \nCorporate debt | 7,717,625 | 7,717,625 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 4,688,522 | 174,178 | — | 4,514,344  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 21,960,127 | $| 12,971,408 | $| 4,474,375 | $| 4,514,344  \n  \nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. If accrued liabilities were carried at fair value, these would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n_Marketable Securities_\n\nCorporate debt consists of floating rate notes with a maturity that may be over multiple years but has interest rates that are reset every three months. US government and agency-backed securities consist of high-quality U.S. Government and government-backed (e.g., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) securities. The Company validates the fair market values of the financial instruments above by using discounted cash flow models, obtaining independent pricing of the securities or through the use of a model that incorporates the three-month interest rate, the credit default swap rate of the issuer and the bid and ask price spread of the same or similar investments which are traded on several markets.\n\n_Equity Investments_\n\nThe Company has an investment in RealWear Inc. (RealWear) which had been valued at $5.2 million. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received shares valued at approximately $0.4 million as payment of royalties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity transaction, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the value of the investment to $2.5 million. In both the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity transaction, and as a result, recorded impairment charges of $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, to reduce the value of the investment to $0.7 million. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned an approximate 2.8% interest in this investment.\n\nThe equity investments categorized as Level 1 at September 28, 2024 were the Company’s equity investments in publicly traded companies that met the categorization requirements for Level 1 classification.\n\nThe equity investments that were not remeasured to fair value and therefore did not meet the Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 classification requirements had a value of $2.0 million at September 28, 2024.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Level 3 equity investments include the Company’s investment in RealWear of $0.7 million and the value of an additional equity investment.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET**\n\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts receivable | $| 10,248,935 | $| 10,731,036  \nLess — allowance for credit losses | (1,015,000| ) | (1,025,000| )  \nTotal | $| 9,233,935 | $| 9,706,036  \n  \nChanges to the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF CHANGE IN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nBalance, December 30, 2023 | $| 1,025,000  \n---|---|---  \nAdditions | 24,000  \nWrite-offs | (34,000| )  \nBalance, September 28, 2024 | $| 1,015,000  \n  \n**6. INVENTORY**\n\nInventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value and consist of the following at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORY\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nRaw materials | $| 3,990,155 | $| 4,785,197  \nWork-in-process | 1,728,166 | 2,018,421  \nFinished goods | 837,038 | 798,188  \nTotal | $| 6,555,359 | $| 7,601,806  \n  \n**7. NET LOSS PER SHARE**\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period less any unvested restricted shares. Diluted net loss per share is calculated using weighted-average shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares, less weighted-average shares reacquired during the period. The net outstanding shares are adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Company’s common stock equivalents, which consist of unvested restricted stock, and outstanding warrants.\n\nThe following were not included in weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted because they are anti-dilutive:\n\nSCHEDULE OF NON-VESTED RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK\n\nThree Months Ended | Three Months Ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nNon-vested restricted common stock | 5,510,914 | 3,948,417 | 5,510,914 | 3,948,417  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \n**8. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION**\n\n_Registered sale of equity securities_\n\nOn September 23, 2024, the Company sold 37,550,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.64 per pre-funded warrant and received gross proceeds of $27.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.8 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company sold 2,405,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of $1.5 million.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 30, 2024, the Company sold 3,080,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $7,466,755 (average of $2.42 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of approximately $0.2 million, pursuant to the Company’s then effective At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2021 (the \"ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\"Stifel”), as agent. The ATM Agreement terminated in the three months ended March 30, 2024.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the Company sold 17,000,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $22.9 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.5 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.\n\n_Non-Vested Restricted Common Stock_\n\nThe fair value of non-vested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for one, two or four years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or the Company’s stock achieving a certain price. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that solely require the recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the anticipated service period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\n\nThe Company granted 4,226,320 and 3,296,051 restricted stock units to its employees, executives and the Board of Directors in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. For fiscal year 2024, 1,137,970 shares are part of an incentive program that would vest upon the successful achievement of certain fiscal year 2024 milestones. Through September 28, 2024, 99,279 shares were earned upon the achievement of milestones, 343,631 were forfeited for failure to meet milestones, and 695,060 may still be earned for achieving milestones in 2024. The fair value of the restricted stock units was based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The time-based shares are expensed over the service period and the milestone-based shares are expensed based upon the probability of achievement.\n\nRestricted stock activity for the nine month period ended September 28, 2024 was as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF NON-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK ACTIVITY\n\nShares | Weighted Average Grant Fair Value  \n---|---  \nBalance, December 30, 2023 | 1,931,767 | $| 1.65  \nGranted | 4,226,320 | 1.30  \nForfeited | (399,644| ) | 2.50  \nVested | (247,529| ) | 2.00  \nBalance, September 28, 2024 | 5,510,914 | 1.30  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \n_Stock-Based Compensation_\n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense within each of the categories below as it relates to non-vested restricted common stock awards for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (no tax benefits were recognized):\n\nSCHEDULE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n\nThree Months Ended | Three Months Ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nCost of product revenues | $| 368,312 | $| 311,455 | $| 857,236 | $| 764,996  \nResearch and development | 308,792 | 214,320 | 569,701 | 553,488  \nSelling, general and administrative | 535,842 | 432,560 | 1,197,355 | 1,025,298  \nTotal | $| 1,212,946 | $| 958,335 | $| 2,624,292 | $| 2,343,782  \nStock based compensation expense | $| 1,212,946 | $| 958,335 | $| 2,624,292 | $| 2,343,782  \n  \nUnrecognized compensation expense for non-vested restricted common stock as of September 28, 2024 totaled $4.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.\n\n**9. ACCRUED WARRANTY**\n\nThe Company typically warrants its products against defect for 12 to 18 months, however, for certain products a customer may purchase an extended warranty. A provision for estimated future costs and estimated returns for credit relating to such warranty is recorded in the period when product is shipped and revenue is recognized and is updated as additional information becomes available. The Company’s estimate of future costs to satisfy warranty obligations is based primarily on historical warranty expense experienced and a provision for potential future product failures. Changes in the accrued warranty for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCRUED WARRANTY\n\nBalance, December 30, 2023 | $| 2,160,000  \n---|---|---  \nAdditions | 700,000  \nClaims | (185,000| )  \nBalance, September 28, 2024 | $| 2,675,000  \n  \n_Extended Warranties_\n\nDeferred revenue represents the purchase of extended warranties by the Company’s customers. The Company recognizes revenue from an extended warranty on the straight-line method over the life of the extended warranty, which is typically 12 to 15 months beyond the standard 12 to 18-month warranty. The Company classifies the current portion of deferred revenue under Other accrued liabilities in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 28, 2024, the Company had less than $0.1 million of deferred revenue related to extended warranties.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**10. INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of less than $0.1 million and approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has available for tax purposes U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs”) of approximately $122.7 million expiring 2024 through 2038 and $107.8 million that have an unlimited carryover period. The Company has recognized a full valuation allowance on its domestic and certain foreign net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization of such assets. The Company recognizes both accrued interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions related to intercompany loan interest and potential transfer pricing exposure related to its foreign subsidiaries.\n\n**11. CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized from customer arrangements, including licensing, exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. The Company classifies the noncurrent portion of contract assets under Other assets in its condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of cost incurred and deferred revenue.\n\nNet contract assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF CONTRACT WITH CUSTOMER, ASSET AND LIABILITY\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023 | $ Change | % Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nContract assets and unbilled receivables —current | $| 8,274,538 | $| 3,409,809 | $| 4,864,729 | 143| %  \nContract liabilities and billings in excess of revenues earned | (268,468| ) | (916,826| ) | 648,358 | (71| )%  \nContract liabilities—noncurrent | — | (23,198| ) | 23,198 | (100| )%  \nNet contract assets | $| 8,006,070 | $| 2,469,785 | $| 5,536,285 | 224| %  \n  \nThe $5.5 million increase in the Company’s net contract assets at September 28, 2024 as compared to December 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in amounts owed from customers for whom we produce products for defense applications.\n\nIn the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of less than $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to its contract liabilities at December 30, 2023. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of less than $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to its contract liabilities at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company did not recognize impairment losses on its contract assets in the three or nine months ended September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\n\n_Performance Obligations_\n\nThe Company’s revenue recognition related to performance obligations that were satisfied at a point in time and over time were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF SATISFACTION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nPoint in time | 11| % | 24| % | 16| % | 27| %  \nOver time | 89| % | 76| % | 84| % | 73| %  \nPerformance obligation percentage | 89| % | 76| % | 84| % | 73| %  \n  \nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ”)). As of September 28, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $25.4 million which the Company expects to recognize over the next 12 months. The remaining performance obligations represent amounts to be earned under government contracts, which are subject to cancellation.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**12. LEASES**\n\nThe Company enters into operating leases primarily for: real estate, including for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration and sales facilities, and information technology (\"IT”) equipment. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company did not have any finance leases. Approximately all of its future lease commitments, and related lease liability, relate to the Company’s real estate leases.

SEGMENTS AND DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE**\n\nThe Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine if any changes have occurred that would affect its reportable segments. The Company reports under one segment, as its Chief Executive Officer, who is its chief operating decision maker (\"CODM”), reviews results on a total company basis.\n\nTotal long-lived assets by country at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were:\n\nSCHEDULE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS\n\nTotal Long-lived Assets (in thousands) | September 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nUnited States | $| 4,199 | $| 4,424  \nUnited Kingdom | 123 | 244  \nTotal | $| 4,322 | $| 4,668  \nLong lived assets | $| 4,322 | $| 4,668  \n  \nThe Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by geographic location and by display application, as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company derived its sales from the following geographies:\n\nSCHEDULE SEGMENT INFORMATION BY REVENUE TYPE\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \n(In thousands, except percentages) | Revenue | % of Total | Revenue | % of Total | Revenue | % of Total | Revenue | % of Total  \nUnited States | $| 12,612 | 95| % | $| 9,879 | 94| % | $| 33,352 | 93| % | $| 27,788 | 88| %  \nOther Americas | — | — | — | — | 5 | — | 5 | —  \nTotal Americas | 12,612 | 95 | 9,879 | 94 | 33,357 | 93 | 27,793 | 88  \nAsia - Pacific | 382 | 3 | 363 | 3 | 1,632 | 5 | 2,956 | 9  \nEurope | 326 | 2 | 356 | 3 | 700 | 2 | 1,068 | 3  \nTotal Revenues | $| 13,320 | 100| % | $| 10,598 | 100| % | $| 35,689 | 100| % | $| 31,817 | 100| %  \n  \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company derived its sales from the following display applications:\n\nSCHEDULE OF SEGMENT REPORTING INFORMATION, BY SEGMENT\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands) | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nDefense | $| 10,434 | $| 4,996 | $| 29,095 | $| 16,482  \nIndustrial | 489 | 310 | 1,883 | 2,118  \nConsumer | — | 200 | 25 | 573  \nR&D | 2,268 | 4,956 | 4,338 | 11,737  \nLicense and royalties | 129 | 136 | 348 | 907  \nTotal Revenues | $| 13,320 | $| 10,598 | $| 35,689 | $| 31,817  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n**14. LITIGATION**\n\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning a joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i,” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleged that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, the claim for punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications and by denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. The Court also ordered discovery reopened for certain limited purposes. A trial date was set by the Court for January 22 to February 5, 2024 but then re-scheduled for March 20 to April 16. On Monday, April 22, 2024, after a four week trial, a jury verdict was entered finding for BlueRadios and awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after post-trial briefing. On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on June 26, 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios’ claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in _BlueRadios, Inc. v. Hamilton, Brook, Smith & Reynolds, P.C._, No. 1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded on October 29, 2024. The Company is currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued $5.1 million in damages as well as $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was recorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\n\n**15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nThe Company may from time to time enter into agreements with stockholders, affiliates and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of its business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies the Company needs to purchase from affiliates to enhance its product offering.\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with its Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. The technology license agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to LST if LST achieves certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. To the extent LST makes improvements to the technology licensed from Kopin, Kopin will receive a license for these improvements for certain markets. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to LST. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President and CEO and former Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is the Founder of LST. As a result of this transaction, in 2022 the Company wrote off the two operating lease assets associated with facilities used for the development of the Company’s organic light emitting diode (OLED) products. The Company has recorded its investment in LST at $0 as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had the following transactions with related parties:\n\nSCHEDULE OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\n\nThree months ended  \n---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nSales | Purchases | Sales | Purchases  \nRealWear, Inc. | $| 94,854 | — | $| 135,918 | $| —  \nHMDmd, Inc. | 76,918 | — | 349,420 | —  \nVuzix Corp | — | 11,905 | — | —  \nSolos Technology | 33,288 | — | — | —  \nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. | 924 | 6,650 | — | 208,933  \n$| 205,984 | 6,650 | $| 485,338 | $| 208,933  \nNine months ended  \n---  \nSeptember 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nSales | Purchases | Sales | Purchases  \nRealWear, Inc. | $| 311,994 | 10,550 | $| 905,564 | $| —  \nHMDmd, Inc. | 299,177 | — | 852,175 | —  \nVuzix Corp | — | 11,905 | — | —  \nSolos Technology | 33,288 | — | — | —  \nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. | 3,158 | 170,850 | — | 416,988  \n$| 647,617 | 193,305 | $| 1,757,739 | $| 416,988  \n  \nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had the following receivables from and payables to related parties:\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nReceivables | Payables | Receivables | Payables  \nRealWear, Inc. | $| 94,854 | $| — | $| 94,902 | $| —  \nHMDmd, Inc. | 101,922 | — | 15,000 | —  \nSolos Technology | 33,288 | — | — | —  \nLightning Silicon Technology, Inc. | 41 | — | 35,013 | 97,600  \n$| 230,105 | $| — | $| 144,915 | $| 97,600  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\n_This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), which are subject to the safe harbor created by such sections.

Such factors may be in addition to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors;” Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and other parts of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. These factors include: our ability to source semiconductor components and other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products; our ability to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively or successfully; our ability to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business; our ability to invest in research and development to achieve profitability even during periods when we are not profitable; our ability to continue to introduce new products in our target markets; our ability to generate revenue growth and positive cash flow, and reach profitability; the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its effects on the price of our products in foreign markets; the impact of new regulations and customer demands relating to conflict minerals; our ability to obtain a competitive advantage in the wearable technologies market through our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how; our ability to grow within our targeted markets; the importance of small form factor displays in the development of defense, consumer, and industrial products such as thermal weapon sights, safety equipment, virtual and augmented reality gaming, training and simulation products and metrology tools; the suitability of our properties for our needs for the foreseeable future; our expectation not to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future and to retain earnings for the development of our businesses; our need to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability; and our expectation that if we do not achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability; our financial condition will ultimately be materially adversely affected, and we will be required to reduce expenses, including our investments in research and development or raise additional capital and our ability to support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months through our available cash resources._\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nWe are a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of miniature displays and optical lenses (our \"components”) for sale as individual displays, components, modules or higher-level subassemblies. We also license our intellectual property through technology license agreements. Our component products are used in highly demanding high-resolution portable defense, enterprise and consumer electronic applications, training and simulation equipment and 3D metrology equipment. Our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.\n\n_Results of Operations_\n\nOur interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of such results may not be indicative of our future operating results. Additionally, we use a fiscal calendar, that may result in differences in the number of workdays in the current and comparable prior interim periods and could affect period-to-period comparisons. The following discussion of comparative results of operations among periods should be viewed in this context.\n\n_Revenues._ For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our revenues by display application, which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts (\"R&D”), were as follows:\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands) | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nDefense | $| 10,434 | $| 4,996 | $| 29,095 | $| 16,482  \nIndustrial | 489 | 310 | 1,883 | 2,118  \nConsumer | — | 200 | 25 | 573  \nR&D | 2,268 | 4,956 | 4,338 | 11,737  \nLicense and royalties | 129 | 136 | 348 | 907  \nTotal Revenues | $| 13,320 | $| 10,598 | $| 35,689 | $| 31,817  \n  \nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. The increase in Defense applications revenues in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in revenues from products used in thermal weapon sights and to a lesser extent due to an increase in revenues from sales of products used in pilot helmets. The increase in Defense applications revenues in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in revenues from products used in thermal weapon sights partially offset by a decline in revenues from sales of products used in pilot helmets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans on devoting production resources to provide units that customers have made warranty claims on, which may impact our fourth quarter revenues.\n\nIndustrial applications revenue represents customers who purchase our display products for use in 3D metrology equipment and headsets used for applications in manufacturing, distribution, and public safety. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The increase in Industrial applications revenues for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in sales of products for 3D metrology. The decrease in Industrial applications revenues for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of products for 3D metrology.\n\nOur displays for Consumer applications are used primarily in thermal imaging products in recreational rifles, first person viewers, and hand-held scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in sales for hand-held thermal viewers.\n\nR&D revenues decreased in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreases in funding for U.S. defense programs. R&D revenues decreased in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in funding for U.S. defense programs as certain programs were completed and customers are evaluating the results and certain programs transitioned to production programs. Included in R&D revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is approximately $400,000 related to OLED development programs with a consumer customer.\n\nInternational revenues represented 5% and 7% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 6% and 12% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We categorize our revenues as either domestic or international based upon the delivery destination of our product. For example, if the customer is located in Asia or if a U.S. customer has its Asian contract manufacturer order product from us and we deliver the product to Asia, then we categorize both of these sales as international. In addition, if we earn royalties on sales from a customer, the royalties are categorized as domestic or international based on how the product revenues are categorized. The decrease in international revenues was a result of a decrease in sales of our OLED products and our display products for 3D metrology applications. Our international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. currency. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors’ products that are denominated in local currencies, which could lead to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets. We have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations, such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations, because of the historically stable exchange rate between the British Pound Sterling (the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary) and the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation impact on our results, if material, is described in further detail under \"Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section below.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n_Cost of Product Revenues._ Cost of product revenues, which is comprised of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands, except for percentages) | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nCost of product revenues | $| 8,317 | $| 5,438 | $| 25,544 | $| 17,759  \nCost of product revenues as a % of net product revenues | 76| % | 99| % | 82| % | 93| %  \n  \nThe decrease in cost of product revenue as a percent of net product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in expected program costs as a result of lower estimate of rework costs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans on devoting production resources to provide units for which customers have made warranty claims. As the Company has already accrued an estimate of the cost to repair these units, we do not expect this to have a material impact on Cost of product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues.\n\nDuring 2023, our manufacturing was impacted by a shortage of several semiconductor components from our normal vendors that are necessary to manufacture our products. For some components we were able to identify and use other sources for the components but for some components primarily used in defense related products, we were not able to avail ourselves of alternate components because their use would have required a requalification of our product by our customer. While the shortage of certain semiconductor components situation has improved, occasional disruptions do occur which may impact our ability to ship product.\n\n_Research and Development._ R&D expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs and programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. R&D costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of display products, and overhead. In fiscal year 2024, our R&D expenditures are related to our display products, overlay weapon sights and OLED display technologies. Funded and internal R&D expenses are combined in research and development expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands) | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nFunded | $| 1,123 | $| 2,346 | $| 2,598 | $| 6,179  \nInternal | 1,474 | 744 | 3,939 | 2,355  \nTotal research and development expense | $| 2,597 | $| 3,090 | $| 6,537 | $| 8,534  \n  \nFunded R&D expense for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on U.S. defense programs and programs previously in development were completed. Internal R&D expense increased due to an increase in display development costs.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative._ Selling, general and administrative (\"S,G&A”) expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and administrative and general corporate expenses. S,G&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\n**Three months ended** | Three months ended | **Nine months ended** | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands, except for percentages) | **September 28, 2024** | September 30, 2023 | **September 28, 2024** | September 30, 2023  \nSelling, general and administration expense | **$** | **5,207** | $ | 4,799 | **$** | **19,707** | $ | 15,913  \nSelling, general and administration expense as a % of revenues | **39** | **%** | 45 | % | **55** | **%** | 50 | %  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nS,G&A increased for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal fees of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in public relation expense of $0.1 million. S,G&A increased for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in legal fees of $3.8 million partially offset by a decrease in credit loss expense of $0.7 million.\n\n_Litigation Damages._ Litigation damages were accrued as a result of the April 22, 2024 jury verdict that was entered against us, awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages.\n\n_Other (Expense) Income, net._ Other (expense) income, net, is primarily composed of interest income, foreign currency transactions, losses on fair value recording of investments and remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our U.K.-based subsidiary and other non-operating income items. Other (expense) income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\nThree months ended | Three months ended | Nine months ended | Nine months ended  \n---|---|---|---  \n(In thousands) | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023 | September 28, 2024 | September 30, 2023  \nOther (expense) income, net | $| (535| ) | $| 317 | $| (907| ) | $| (2,752| )  \n  \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded foreign currency gains of $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, as compared to foreign currency losses of less than $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other (expense) income, net for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 includes $1.6 million and $3.3 million of impairment losses on equity investments, respectively.\n\n_Tax Provision._ We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. We recorded a provision for income taxes of less than $0.1 million and approximately $0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_Net Loss._ We incurred net losses of $3.5 million and $41.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, compared to net losses of $2.5 million and $13.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in net loss during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an improvement of gross margins and foreign currency gains partially offset by an increase in legal expense. The increase in the net loss during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to accrued litigation damages and legal fees.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of $37.3 million and $17.9 million, respectively, and working capital of $19.1 million and $24.0 million, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to an equity raise of $25.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 in addition to the sale of common stock of $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 which was partially offset by cash used in operations of $12.6 million. Our cash and cash equivalents and liquidity could be adversely affected by any amounts that become payable in connection with any adverse results from any litigation we are, or may become, involved in.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nOn September 23, 2024, we sold 37,550,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.64 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $27.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the us of $1.8 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, we sold 2,405,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of $1.5 million.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 30, 2024, we sold 3,080,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $7,466,755 (average of $2.42 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of approximately $0.2 million, pursuant to our then effective At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2021 (the \"ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (\"Stifel”), as agent. The ATM Agreement terminated in the three months ended March 30, 2024.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses of $19.7 million and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2023. We incurred a net loss of $41.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of $12.6 million. In addition, we have experienced a significant decline in its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding operating losses. As described in Note 14 Litigation, on April 22, 2024, a jury verdict was entered against us awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after briefing on the issues. We have argued that the damages, disgorgement and exemplary damages should be reduced or eliminated. Final briefing on the issued occurred on October 29, 2024. We are also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment. We had $37.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at September 28, 2024.\n\nWe have had historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. Our current strategy is to continue to invest in its business and raise additional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings and private placements of our common stock, preferred stock offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements and issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, we plan to strategically manage its uncommitted spending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative expenditures which could include minimizing staff costs. We may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There are inherent uncertainties associated with fundraising activities and activities to manage our uncommitted spending and the successful execution of these activities may not be within our control. There are no assurances that such additional funding will be obtained and that we will succeed in our future operations. If we are unable to achieve positive cash flows and profitability in the foreseeable future or cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic plan, our liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. Unless the recommended disgorgement and exemplary damages are significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities held in U.S. dollars at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows:\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 | December 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nDomestic locations | $| 37,142,691 | $| 17,725,979  \nInternational locations | 38,225 | 95,547  \nSubtotal cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities held in U.S. dollars | 37,180,916 | 17,821,526  \nCash and cash equivalents held in other currencies and converted to U.S. dollars | 111,920 | 81,159  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities | $| 37,292,836 | $| 17,902,685  \n  \nWe have no plans to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiary Forth Dimension Displays, Ltd. (\"FDD”), and, as such, we have not recorded any deferred tax liability with respect to such cash.\n\nWe expect to expend between $1.0 million and $2.0 million on capital expenditures in 2024.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nA discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**\n\nWe invest our excess cash in high-quality U.S. Government, government-backed (e.g., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) and corporate debt instruments, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrealized gain or loss on debt securities. We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ financial position, results of operations, and transaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows related to business activities in Europe, and remeasurement of U.S. dollars to the British pound, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries. We are also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials, which are in U.S. dollars, but the price on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations or investments is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Our portfolio of marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments may be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. We use silicon wafers but do not enter into forward or futures hedging contracts to mitigate against risks related to the price of silicon.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**\n\n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”). The term \"disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**Part II. OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning a joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i,” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleged that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, the claim for punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications and by denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. The Court also ordered discovery reopened for certain limited purposes. A trial date was set by the Court for January 22 to February 5, 2024 but then re-scheduled for March 20 to April 16. On Monday, April 22, 2024, after a four week trial, a jury verdict was entered finding for BlueRadios and awarding approximately $5.1 million in damages as well as recommending $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after post-trial briefing. On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, over $10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on June 26, 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios’ claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in _BlueRadios, Inc. v. Hamilton, Brook, Smith & Reynolds, P.C._, No. 1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded on October 29, 2024. The Company is currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued $5.1 million in damages as well as $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was recorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1A. Risk Factors**\n\nOur business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result, the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. There have been no material changes in the assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, except for the risk factors noted below.\n\n_We may not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock’s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital._\n\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. On October 14, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \"Staff”) of Nasdaq, indicating that our common stock was subject to potential delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market because, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Requirement”). Nasdaq stated in its letter that in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have been provided an initial period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until April 14, 2025 (the \"Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. The letter states that Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Bid Price Requirement if at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days.\n\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second 180 calendar day compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\n\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date and is not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.\n\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance or otherwise maintain compliance with any of the other listing requirements.\n\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\n\nSuch a delisting would also likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we may take actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Bid Price Requirement or prevent future non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements.\n\n_Ongoing litigation may result in substantial financial and operational impacts._\n\nWe are currently involved in litigation related to an alleged breach of contract, which is being pursued by BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”). This litigation could lead to a final judgment impacting our financial and operational results. A jury has already awarded $5.1 million in damages as well as recommended $19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages related to this matter. These damages have been accrued, however the liability and or possible future payout could increase or decrease as a result of the final judgement issued by the court.\n\nIn addition, on May 22, 2024, we filed a Motion for Judgement as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. There is no guarantee that these will be granted. Furthermore, on the same day, BlueRadios filed a motion seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting us from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios’ trade secrets, along with requiring us to pay $10 million in pre-judgment interest and over $10 million in attorneys’ fees and costs. Final briefing on the motions occurred on October 18, 2024. If the court rules in favor of BlueRadios on these motions, we may face substantial additional damages beyond those already accrued.\n\nIf we choose to appeal, there is no assurance that such an appeal would be successful. An unfavorable outcome could significantly affect our business operations and limit our ability to generate future revenues.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nWe did not sell any securities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 that were not registered under the Securities Act.\n\n**Item 6.

Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “could,” “would,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements expressed or implied in the proxy statement.

This proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card and our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, are being first mailed to stockholders on or about April 26, 2024. Stockholders will be asked to consider and act upon the following matters at the Meeting: \n\n1.| To elect the six (6) directors to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company each for a term expiring at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.   \n---|---  \n2.| To approve an amendment to the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan from 11,000,000 to 14,000,000.   \n---|---  \n3.| A proposal to ratify an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares from 150,000,000 to 200,000,000.   \n---|---  \n4.| To ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the current fiscal year ending December 28, 2024.   \n---|---  \n5.| To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.   \n---|---  \n  \nAll solicitation expenses, including costs of preparing, assembling and mailing proxy materials, will be borne by the Company. It is expected that solicitations will be made primarily by mail, but our directors, officers and other employees also may solicit proxies by telephone and in person, without additional compensation. Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for proxy materials to be sent to their principals, and we will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing. \n\nThe close of business on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, has been established as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and at any adjournments thereof. As of the record date, there were 118,428,003 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned as of the record date on all matters to come before the Meeting and any adjournments thereof. The presence in person or by proxy of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting. \n\nStockholders may vote by completing the enclosed proxy card and mailing it in the envelope provided, by using the toll-free telephone number provided on the proxy card, over the Internet or in person at the Meeting. The Internet and telephone voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, the day before the Meeting. Any proxy submitted prior to the Meeting may be revoked at any time before it is voted by written notice of revocation received by the Secretary of the Company prior to the Meeting, by delivering a later dated proxy in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy by voting in person at the Meeting or by revoking a written proxy by request in person at the Meeting. If the proxy submitted is not so revoked, the shares represented by such proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If no choice is specified for one or more proposals in a proxy submitted by or on behalf of a stockholder, the shares represented by such proxy will be voted in favor of such proposals and in the discretion of the named proxies with respect to any other proposals that may properly come before the Meeting. \n\n1\n\nFor Proposal 1, our Sixth Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”) provide a majority voting standard for election of directors in uncontested elections. Each director will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, meaning that the number of votes cast “FOR” a director nominee exceeds the number of “AGAINST” votes with respect to that director’s election. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for Proposal 1. Pursuant to our By-laws, each person who is nominated to stand for election as director must tender an irrevocable and executed letter of resignation in advance of the meeting for the election of directors. If an incumbent director nominee is not elected in an uncontested election and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (excluding the nominee, if applicable) then will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board, excluding the nominee, will act on the resignation and publicly disclose its decision in accordance with the By-laws. \n\nProposals 2, 4 and 5 will be approved upon the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote on each such proposal. Abstentions will be counted for each of Proposals 2, 4 and 5, and will have the same effect as a vote against each such proposal. Broker non- votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the vote of Proposals 2, 4 or 5. However, Proposal 4, the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, is considered a “routine” matter. As such, brokers that have not received voting instructions from the beneficial holders are allowed to vote their clients’ shares on Proposal 4 without having received voting instructions.\n\nProposal 3 will be approved upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. Proposal 3 is considered a discretionary matter. Therefore, if your shares are held by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee in “street name” and you do not provide voting instructions with respect to your shares, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee may vote your shares on Proposal 3. Broker non-votes (if any) and abstentions will have the same effect as votes cast against the proposal. \n\nIf, in a proxy submitted on behalf of a stockholder by a person acting solely in a representative capacity, the proxy is marked clearly to indicate that the shares represented thereby are not being voted with respect to one or more proposals, then such proxies will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Meeting. Proxies marked as “abstain” as to one or more proposals will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum at the Meeting and for the purpose of calculating the vote on such proposals. Such abstentions will have the effect of a vote against such proposals other than Proposal 1 (for which they will have no effect on the voting results). \n\nThe chairman of the Meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote have the power to adjourn the Meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the Meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting. \n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, we do not know of any matters that will be brought before the Meeting other than those matters specifically set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if any other matter properly comes before the Meeting, it is intended that the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy card, or their substitutes acting thereunder, will vote on any such matter in accordance with their best judgment. \n\nCorporate Governance Matters \n\nOur Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The following table lists each of our current directors and provides membership information for each of the committees: \n\nName| ​| ​| Audit| ​| ​| Compensation| ​| ​| Nominating andCorporate Governance   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nScott L.

Our Board has also adopted corporate governance guidelines, a code of business conduct and ethics for employees, executive officers and directors, a policy on conflict minerals sourcing and a whistleblower policy regarding the treatment of complaints on accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters. All of these documents are available on our website at www.kopin.com under the heading “Investors Relations: Governance Documents.” A copy of any of these documents may be obtained, without charge, upon written request to Kopin Corporation, c/o Investor Relations, 125 North Drive, Westborough, MA 01581. \n\nCorporate Governance Practices and Board Independence \n\nEach year, our Board reviews the relationships that each director has with us and with other parties. With the exception of Dr. Fan, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and current Board member, and Michael Murray our current President and Chief Executive Officer, only those directors who do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude them from being independent within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Marketplace Rules (the “Nasdaq Rules”), and whom the Board affirmatively determines have no relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, are considered to be independent directors. Our Board has reviewed several factors to evaluate the independence of each of its members. These factors include the members’ current and historic relationships with us and our competitors, suppliers and customers; their relationships with management and other directors; the relationships their current and former employers have with us; and the relationships between us and other companies of which a member of our Board is a director or executive officer. After evaluating these factors, our Board has determined that a majority of the members of the Board, namely Scott L. Anchin, Jill J. Avery, James K. Brewington, Chi Chia Hsieh and David Nieuwsma, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as a director and are independent directors of Kopin Corporation within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq Rules. \n\nIn making its independence determinations, our Board considered transactions occurring since the beginning of 2021 between us and entities associated with the independent directors or members of their immediate family. All identified transactions that appear to relate to Kopin Corporation and a person or entity with a known connection to a director are presented to the Board for consideration. In making its subjective determination that each non-employee director is independent, our Board considered the transactions in the context of the Nasdaq Rules, the standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees and the SEC and Internal Revenue Service standards for compensation committee members. Our Board’s independence determinations included reviewing the following transactions and relationships: \n\nDr. Hsieh is a director of KoBrite Corp. (“KoBrite”), in which Kopin owns a minority interest. Dr. Hsieh is also a director of Bright LED, which is the majority owner of KoBrite. \n\nDr. Fan is currently chairman of the board of directors of LST and Solos Inc., both private companies in which the Company has investments. Dr. Fan is also on the board of directors of Lakeside Lightning Silicon, Inc., a private company.\n\nNomination and Election of Directors \n\nWhen seeking candidates for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “Nominating Committee”) may solicit suggestions from incumbent directors, management or others. After conducting an initial evaluation of a candidate, the Nominating Committee will interview that candidate if it believes the candidate might be suitable to serve as a director. The Nominating Committee may also ask the candidate to meet with our management. If the Nominating Committee believes a candidate would be a valuable addition to the Board and there is either a vacancy on the Board or the Nominating Committee believes it is in the best interests of Kopin Corporation and its stockholders to increase the number of board members, it will recommend that candidate’s election to the full Board. \n\n3\n\nBefore nominating a sitting director for re-election at an annual stockholder meeting, the Nominating Committee will consider the director’s performance on the Board and whether the director’s re-election would be consistent with our corporate governance guidelines and our continued compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. \n\nOur Board believes that it should be comprised of directors with diverse and complementary backgrounds, and that directors should have expertise that, at a minimum, may be useful to us and may contribute to the success of our business. Directors also should possess the highest personal and professional ethics and should be willing and able to devote an amount of time sufficient to effectively carry out their duties and contribute to the success of our business. When considering candidates for director, the Nominating Committee takes into account a number of factors, which may include the following: \n\n•| Independence from management;   \n---|---  \n•| Age, background and gender;   \n---|---  \n•| Relevant business experience;   \n---|---  \n•| Judgment, skill and integrity;   \n---|---  \n•| Existing commitments to other businesses;   \n---|---  \n•| Potential conflicts of interest;   \n---|---  \n•| Corporate governance background;   \n---|---  \n•| Financial and accounting background;   \n---|---  \n•| Executive compensation background; and   \n---|---  \n•| Size and composition of the existing Board.   \n---|---  \n  \nStockholder Proposals \n\nThe Nominating Committee will consider candidates for director suggested by stockholders by considering the foregoing criteria and the additional information referred to below.

Kopin has adopted policies and procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which Kopin, or a subsidiary, is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. In reviewing a transaction or relationship, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, the nature and terms of the transaction, the dollar value of the transaction, the business reasons for the transaction, whether it is on terms no more favorable than to an unaffiliated third party under similar circumstances, as well as the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees, Executive Officers and Directors prohibits any transaction or relationship that would create a conflict of interest, unless approved by the Board. Conflicts of interests are to be reported to the applicable employees’ immediate supervisor or our Chief Financial Officer. \n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (“LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with its Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. The technology license agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to LST if LST achieves certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. To the extent LST makes improvements to the technology licensed from Kopin, Kopin will receive a license for these improvements for certain markets. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to LST. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former \n\n5\n\nPresident and CEO and former Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is the Founder of LST. As a result of this transaction, in 2022 the Company wrote off the two operating lease assets associated with facilities used for the development of the Company’s organic light emitting diode (OLED) products. The Company has recorded its investment in LST at $0 as of December 30, 2023. \n\nOn September 30, 2019 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Solos Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company sold and licensed certain assets of the Company’s SolosTM (“Solos”) product line and Whisper™ Audio (“Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction the Company received a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Incorporation (“Solos Inc.”). The Company’s 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing. The Company will also receive a royalty in the single digits on the net sales amount of Solos products for a three-year period, after the commencement of commercial production. The Company has performed the analysis and identified Solos Technology as a variable interest entity that should not be consolidated by Kopin, as Kopin is not the primary beneficiary of the entity. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to Solos Inc., and its potential loss exposure is the value of the investment recorded on its books. Based on the price paid for equity by the other 80.0% owners of Solos Inc., volatility based on a peer group and assumptions about the risk-free interest rate, the Company estimated the fair value of its equity holdings at $0.6 million and in 2019 recorded a $0.6 million gain on its investment for this equity transaction as the basis of assets transferred was zero. In the second quarters of 2020 and 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and other factors of the customer and, as a result, the Company recorded impairment charges of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to reduce its investment in the customer to $0.2 million as of December 30, 2023. Dr. Fan is currently chairman of the board of directors of Solos Inc., a private company in which the Company has investments. \n\nWe do not currently provide personal loans to our executive officers or directors. Other than Proposal 1, none of our directors, executive officers or their associates have a substantial interest in any of the matters to be acted upon at the Meeting. \n\n6\n\nPROPOSAL 1 \n\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS \n\nOur By-laws provide that the Board shall consist of not less than three nor more than 13 directors. At the Meeting, proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of individuals than the six nominees named in this Proxy Statement. Unless authority is withheld, it is the intention of the persons voting under the enclosed proxy to vote such proxy in favor of the election of each of the nominees to serve as director until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If any nominee is unavailable or unwilling to serve, such votes will be cast by the proxies either for a substitute nominee selected by the proxies or to fix the number of directors at a lesser number. Our Board currently has no reason to expect that any of the nominees will be unavailable or unwilling to serve. Each of the nominees has consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. \n\nVote Required for Election \n\nThe election of directors requires a majority voting standard for election of directors in uncontested elections. Each director will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, meaning that the number of votes cast “FOR” a director nominee exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Any “non-votes” and abstentions from voting received will have no effect on the outcome of this Proposal 1. \n\nPursuant to our By-laws, each person who is nominated to stand for election as director must tender an irrevocable and executed letter of resignation in advance of the Meeting for the election of directors. If an incumbent director nominee is not elected by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating Committee (excluding the nominee, if applicable) then will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board, excluding the nominee, will act on the resignation and publicly disclose its decision in accordance with the By- laws. \n\nThe Board of Directors has nominated and recommends that you vote “FOR” the election of each of the nominees listed below to serve as our Directors until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\n\nSet forth below are the name and age for each director nominee, his or her principal occupation and business experience during the past five years and the names of other publicly-traded companies of which he or she served as a director. \n\nName| ​| ​| Age| ​| ​| Served as Director Since| ​| ​| Position and Offices with the Company   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nScott L.

We believe this leadership structure is appropriate for us given the size and scope of our business, the experience and active involvement of our independent directors, and our corporate governance practices, which include regular communication with and interaction between and among the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and the independent directors. Pursuant to our By-laws, our Board selects the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer that it determines to be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our Board has determined that each of Scott L. Anchin, Jill J. Avery, Chi-Chia Hsieh, David Nieuwsma and Marnie Seif are independent as that term is defined under the applicable independence listing standards of Nasdaq Rules and the applicable SEC rules and regulations. \n\nWe believe that our directors provide effective oversight of risk management functions. Annually, we perform a risk review where the management team evaluates the risks facing us in the upcoming year and over a longer-term horizon, typically three years. From this risk assessment, we develop plans to deal with the risks identified. This risk assessment is provided to the Board and their input is reflected in the annual risk assessment. \n\nIn addition, members of our management periodically present to the Board the strategies, issues and plans for the product lines they manage. The Compensation Committee also reviews our incentive plans to determine whether they result in management behavior that may result in additional risk beyond the plans’ intended purpose. While the Board oversees our risk management, our management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. Additionally, the Board requires that management raise exceptional issues to the Board. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing us and that the Board leadership structure supports this approach. \n\nBoard and Committee Meetings \n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, our Board held four meetings. For each director, overall attendance at Board meetings and relevant committee meetings, either in person or by conference call, was greater than 75% during the period they were on the committee. All directors attended the Company’s 2023 annual stockholder meeting except for Dr. Hsieh and Mr. Nieuwsma. Mr. Nieuwsma joined the Board of Directors after the annual meeting. Although we currently do not require our directors to attend annual stockholder meetings, we do encourage directors to do so and welcome their attendance. \n\nAudit Committee: We have established a separately designated Audit Committee as defined by Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. Our Audit Committee was composed of three directors: Scott L. Anchin, Jill J. Avery, and James K. Brewington, each of whom the Board has determined is independent under the Nasdaq Rules and the applicable SEC rules and regulations. The Board has determined that Mr. Anchin is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. Our Board adopted an Audit Committee Charter, which is available on our website at www.kopin.com under the heading “Investor Relations: Governance Documents.” Our Audit Committee Charter delegates to the Audit Committee the responsibility, among other things, to engage our independent auditors, review the audit fees, supervise matters relating to audit functions, review and set internal policies and procedure regarding audits, accounting and other financial controls and review related party transactions. The Audit Committee pre-approved \n\n10\n\nall audit and non-audit services provided by RSM US LLP for fiscal year 2023. During the 2023 fiscal year, our Audit Committee met in person or through a conference call five times. All members participated in all five meetings. \n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee: Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee presently is composed of three directors: Dr. Jill Avery, Mr. Brewington and Dr. Hsieh, each of whom the Board has determined is independent under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, considering potential Board members, making recommendations to the full Board as to nominees for election to the Board, assessing the effectiveness of the Board and implementing our corporate governance guidelines. The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is available on the Company’s website at www.kopin.com under the heading “Investor Relations: Governance Documents.” During the 2023 fiscal year, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met in person or through a conference call once and all members participated in the meetings. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee engaged and paid a fee to a consultant, Egon Zehnder, to identify possible Board of Director candidates, The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members periodically met with Egon Zehnder for status updates and to review candidates. \n\nCompensation Committee: Our Compensation Committee presently is composed of three directors: Mr. Anchin, Mr. Brewington and Dr. Hsieh, each of whom the board has determined is independent under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Rules. The charter of the Compensation Committee is available on our website at www.kopin.com under the heading “Investor Relations: Governance Documents.” During the 2023 fiscal year, our Compensation Committee met in person or through a conference call four times. Mr. Brewington and Dr. Hsieh participated in each meeting. Mr. Anchin was added to the Compensation Committee in December of 2023 which was subsequent to the four meetings. The Compensation Committee is responsible for the approval of remuneration arrangements for our executive officers, review and approval of compensation plans relating to executive officers and directors, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and stock grants under our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and other benefits and general review of our employee compensation policies.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation \n\nNone of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any other entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee. None of the current members of our Compensation Committee has ever been an employee of Kopin or any subsidiary of Kopin. \n\nBoard Diversity Matrix \n\nWe believe that, as a company serving a wide variety of markets across multiple geographies, embracing and cultivating diversity is an essential part of serving our customers and increasing stockholder value.

Sneider, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)   \n---|---  \n•| Paul Baker, Chief Operating Officer (COO)   \n---|---  \n  \nExecutive Summary \n\nProvided below are key Company performance and executive compensation highlights for fiscal 2023: \n\nIn 2023, we commercialized some of our technologies, continued to ramp up production on a key military program and restructured the business to reduce costs. Below is a summary of certain performance highlights that occurred in 2023: \n\n•| Our gross margins were raised to approximately four percent for 2023 compared to approximately zero for 2022.Our operating loss decreased from $21.8 million to $17.2 million. Our operating loss included an increase of approximately $5.0 million, the majority of which relates to a matter being litigated.   \n---|---  \n•| In 2023 we received follow-on orders of $19.9 million for our displays for thermal weapon sights and a $3.4 million order for our displays for a fixed wing pilot’s helmet application. In addition, we continued the development of other funded R&D programs including the U.S. Army armored vehicle, a headset for surgery and micro-LED.   \n---|---  \n•| We restructured the organization and increased staffing in quality control, program management and business development   \n---|---  \n  \nCompensation Highlights: \n\nSummarized below are highlights with respect to executive compensation for fiscal year 2023: \n\n•| Mr. Murray and Mr. Sneider received no increase in base wages, while Mr. Baker’s base wages increased from $315,000 to $324,450.   \n---|---  \n•| Our primary objective for fiscal year 2023 was to continue to increase revenues and cash flow. To that end, we granted our CEO, CFO and COO 107,500, 83,000, and 74,800 shares of restricted stock, respectively, which could have been earned if certain revenue, cash flow and individual goals were met. The number of shares granted represented 35% of their 2022 base wages divided by approximately the Company’s share price on day of grant. 20% of the shares could have been earned by meeting certain revenue targets, 70% of the shares could have been earned by meeting certain cash flow targets and 10% could be earned based on meeting individual goals in fiscal 2023. The revenue and cash flow goals had a minimum base amount, a target amount and a maximum upper goal amount. If the minimum base amount was not achieved, then no restricted stock was earned. If the minimum base amount was achieved approximately 30% of the shares could be earned, if the target amount was achieved approximately 75% of the shares could be earned and if the maximum upper goals was achieved all of the shares could be earned.   \n---|---  \n  \nMessrs. Murray, Sneider and Baker earned 102,345,79,020 and 71,213, respectively, of the shares granted which represents achieving approximately 95% of the goals. \n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer: \n\nIn September 2022, Mr. Michael Murray joined Kopin as President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMr. Murray received an annual base salary of $450,000. Additionally, Mr. Murray received 800,000 shares of restricted stock, which vest in 20% increments each December 10 beginning in 2023, and a sign-on bonus of\n\n$100,000. Mr. Murray is entitled to an annual performance-based bonus opportunity in the form of cash and long-term awards, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Murray also is eligible for the Company’s standard benefits package and to participate in all applicable group employee benefit plans and \n\n14\n\nprograms offered. In the event Mr. Murray’s employment is terminated without Cause upon or within 12 months following a Change of Control (each as defined in the certain letter agreement, by and between Mr. Murray and the Company (the “Agreement”)), (i) Mr. Murray may receive a lump sum payment within 60 days following the termination date equal to the greater of $450,000 or his annualized base salary immediately prior to such termination, (ii) any outstanding equity awards held on the termination date that vest based solely on continued service and would have vested over the following 12 months if not for the termination will become vested,\n\n(iii) Mr. Murray will receive a lump sum payment within 60 days following the termination date equal to the COBRA premium that he would pay if he had elected to continue health coverage under the Company’s health plan. \n\nOn April 15, 2024 the Company and Mr. Murray signed a new Employment Agreement (the “New Agreement”). This summary of the New Agreement is subject to the terms of the New Agreement which is filed with the SEC as an exhibit to Form 8-K. Under the New Agreement, Mr. Murray’s salary was set at $495,000 with eligibility for a target bonus of 100% of base salary up to a maximum of 150% base salary based on a formula and the determination of achievement of goals as determined by the Board. Mr. Murray also is eligible for the Company’s standard benefits package and to participate in all applicable group employee benefit plans and programs offered. Mr. Murray is eligible to receive equity awards covering the Company’s common stock. As of the effective date of the New Agreement, Mr. Murray is no longer eligible to participate in the executive stock program applicable to other senior executives of the Company. Provided that Mr. Murray continues to be employed by the Company on the date of a change of control (as defined in the New Agreement), all outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Murray immediately prior to the effective date of a change of control which vest based upon his continued service over time shall accelerate, become fully vested and/or exercisable, as the case may be, immediately prior to the change of control, and all outstanding equity awards held immediately prior to the change of control which vest based upon attainment of performance criteria shall vest based on target performance immediately prior to the change of control.\n\nKey Compensation Governance Attributes: \n\nOur pay practices emphasize good governance and market practice: \n\nWhat We Do| ​| ​| What We Don’t Do  \n---|---|---|---  \n✔| ​| ​| Stock Ownership guidelines for the CEO and Non- Employee Directors| ​| ​| ✘| ​| ​| Employment agreements for anyone other than the CEO   \n✔| ​| ​| Maintain a clawback policy| ​| ​| ✘| ​| ​| Excise tax gross-up provisions   \n✔| ​| ​| Emphasize pay for performance| ​| ​| ✘| ​| ​| Executive perquisites   \n✔| ​| ​| Perform annual compensation risk assessment| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n  \n2023 Say on Pay Vote: \n\n•| In 2023, our stockholders voted to approve our executive compensation program (also known as “Say on Pay”) for the twelfth time, and of the 34,701,305 votes cast, 33,029,244, or 95.2%, were in favor. The Compensation Committee considered the results of this advisory vote as it continually evaluates the Company’s compensation programs and policies to ensure that the programs strike a balance between internal (business strategy) and external (stockholder) alignment.   \n---|---  \n  \nCompensation Philosophy \n\nWe believe that our NEOs play a critical role in the operational and financial performance of our company that creates long-term value for our stockholders. Accordingly, our executive compensation philosophy is to reward our executives for individual performance and for contributions to our performance. We have invested significant efforts and funds in developing new technologies and products for both our traditional markets, military and industrial, and for the emerging “wearables” industrial market. In fiscal 2022, our strategic emphasis shifted to improving operational excellence. Accordingly, we are in the process of adjusting our performance award system to be based more towards financial and operational metrics, specifically revenue growth, gross margin improvement, on-time in-full deliveries, production yields, and cash flow improvement. \n\nWe strive to counterbalance our employee retention objectives and pay-for-performance objectives. Historically we believe we have accomplished this by compensating our executives with a combination of base \n\n15\n\nsalary, performance bonus awards and long-term equity-based retention compensation. In fiscal 2023, we maintained the same philosophy but believed that our management would be more incentivized by a significant restricted stock grant that would vest upon the attainment of revenue and cash flow milestones than a cash bonus. \n\nWe believe that the quality, commitment and performance of our executives are critical factors affecting our long-term value. Accordingly, our compensation objectives include: \n\n•| aligning our executive’s interests with the Company’s goals and our stockholders’ interests;   \n---|---  \n•| retaining our executives and key employees; and   \n---|---  \n•| rewarding individuals for their performance.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, we periodically use benchmarks and peer group comparisons to assist us in determining whether our executive compensation is appropriate in light of our compensation objectives and philosophy. \n\nRole of the Compensation Committee \n\nThe Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors sets our executive compensation policies and determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our executive officers and Board of Directors. As set forth in the Compensation Committee’s written charter, its responsibilities include establishing compensation policies for our directors and executive officers; reviewing and approving the Chief Executive Officer’s annual compensation; approving employment agreements or arrangements with executive officers; administering our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and legacy equity award plans (the “Equity Plans”) and approving grants under the 2020 Equity Plan; and making recommendations regarding any other incentive compensation or equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee may delegate certain authority with respect to compensation matters to our executive officers. \n\nThe Compensation Committee considers the amounts and elements of compensation for our executive officers, both for the past and the upcoming fiscal year based on the following: \n\n•| the Company’s next fiscal year’s forecasted development and financial results;   \n---|---  \n•| the evaluation and performance review process; and   \n---|---  \n•| the Compensation Committee members’ personal experience and trends identified in the peer group benchmarking analysis.   \n---|---  \n  \nFor all employees, other than our NEOs and certain executive officers, the Compensation Committee approves ranges of merit increase, for example up to 5% of base salary compensation based on recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer. \n\nFor all executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee establishes and approves the base salary compensation based on recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer. \n\nWith respect to compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee establishes and approves the compensation determinations based on the Compensation Committee’s evaluation and performance reviews of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. \n\nA copy of the Compensation Committee charter is posted on our website, www.kopin.com, under the heading “Investors: Corporate Governance.” For the fiscal year 2023, our Compensation Committee consisted of Dr. Hsieh (Chairperson), Mr. Brewington, and Mr. Scott Anchin. All Board members who served on the Compensation Committee in 2023 were determined to be an independent director as determined by our Board, based upon the Nasdaq Rules and our independence guidelines. \n\nThe Role of Management \n\nAt the request of the Committee, NEOs of the Company may be present at Compensation Committee meetings for discussion purposes. However, they are not involved in the decisions made by the Committee, nor do they have a vote on any matters brought before the Committee. The Compensation Committee meets with the Chief Executive Officer to discuss his performance and compensation package, but ultimately, decisions \n\n16\n\nregarding his package are made solely based upon the Committee’s deliberations, as well as input from the compensation consultant, as requested. The Compensation Committee considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as input from the compensation consultant as requested, to make decisions regarding other NEOs. \n\nRole of the Compensation Consultant \n\nIn making its determinations with respect to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has periodically engaged the services of a compensation consultant to provide input on trends in executive compensation and to obtain an outside perspective on our executive compensation practices and assist with our peer group benchmarking analysis. The Compensation Committee does not believe a formal annual peer group assessment by an independent third party is necessary unless either internal factors, such as employee turn-over, or external factors, such as published reports in industry periodicals, indicate significant changes in executive compensation have taken place. In 2017, the Company engaged Radford, an Aon company (“Radford”), as the compensation consultant to provide the following services: \n\n•| Recommend changes to the peer group of comparable companies;   \n---|---  \n•| Complete a competitive analysis of compensation for each executive utilizing comparable peer company compensation data;   \n---|---  \n•| Provide assistance with our long-term incentive strategy; and   \n---|---  \n•| Provide general executive compensation advice.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the Company periodically asks Radford for assistance in benchmarking the compensation and long-term incentives of the CEO and other NEOs. \n\nIn 2023 Radford was engaged to review the Company’s Board of Director compensation. \n\nThe compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and carries out responsibilities as assigned by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate the compensation consultant and to approve the compensation consultant’s fees and all other terms of the engagement. The Committee exercised this authority to engage Radford as its independent compensation consultant and has direct access to the compensation consultant throughout the year. Radford serves as an advisor to the Compensation Committee on topics primarily related to Board and executive compensation. Radford does not provide us with any services other than the services provided at the request of the Compensation Committee. \n\nThe Compensation Committee periodically reviews the services provided by its outside consultants and believes that Radford is independent in providing executive compensation consulting services. The Compensation Committee conducted a specific review of its relationship with Radford in preparation of the 2024 proxy statement and determined that Radford’s work for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest, consistent with the guidance provided under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). \n\nCompensation Determinations \n\nIn making determinations with respect to amounts and elements of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee evaluates our overall performance during the fiscal year against development plans and annual budgets; evaluates the Chief Executive Officer’s achievements against the Board’s expectations; obtains input from the Chief Executive Officer on the performance reviews of the other executive officers; evaluates the potential for future contributions by each executive to our long-term success; and periodically compares our executive compensation against a benchmarking analysis of a group of peer companies. In 2017, we did a formal benchmarking analysis of our CEO, EVP of Display Operations, CFO and CTO compensation. \n\nPeer Group – NEO Compensation \n\nIn 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford to assist in selecting a new peer group with a median revenue and market capitalization size that approximated ours. Based on Radford’s structured peer group review process and recommendations: \n\n17\n\n•| Six companies—Clearfield Inc., CVD Equipment Corp, GSI Technology Inc., Innovative Solutions & Support Inc., QuickLogic Corp. and Rubicon Technology, Inc.—were removed from the peer group due to acquisition or because their revenues and market capitalization were materially different than ours.   \n---|---  \n•| Three companies of generally similar size were added: Digimarc, DSP Group and Maxwell Technologies.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe final 2017 peer group consisted of 13 companies with a median revenue and market capitalization size that approximated ours and included the following companies: \n\n•| ​| ​| CEVA Inc.| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| Maxwell Technologies   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n•| ​| ​| Digimarc.| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| Mesa Laboratories Inc.   \n•| ​| ​| DSP Group| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| Microvision Inc.   \n•| ​| ​| eMagin Corp.| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| NVE Corp.   \n•| ​| ​| ID Systems Inc.| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| PDF Solutions Inc.   \n•| ​| ​| Immersion Corp.| ​| ​| •| ​| ​| Pixelworks, Inc.   \n•| ​| ​| Intevac Inc.| ​  \n​| ​| ​  \n  \nPeer Group – Board of Director Compensation \n\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford to assist in selecting a new peer group with a median revenue and market capitalization size that approximated ours for the purposes of benchmarking our Board of Director compensation. Based on Radford’s structured peer group review process and recommendations: \n\n•| Five companies—DSP Group., ID Systems Inc., Maxwell Technologies, Microvision Inc, and PDF Solutions Inc.—were removed from the peer group due to acquisition or because their revenues and market capitalization were materially different than ours.   \n---|---  \n•| Twelve companies of generally similar size were added: 908 Devices, Amtech Systems, Aware, Coda Octopus Group, Emcore, Everspin Technologies, GSI Technology, InTEST, Ouster, PowerFleet, Quicklogic and Vuzix   \n---|---  \n  \nElements of Compensation \n\nOur compensation program is designed to be simple, straightforward and fair. We use the following compensation and benefits elements to provide an overall competitive compensation and benefits package that is tied to creating stockholder value and supporting the execution of our business strategies: \n\n•| Base salary;   \n---|---  \n•| Annual incentive (cash or restricted stock);   \n---|---  \n•| Long-term incentives; and   \n---|---  \n•| Employment and change-in-control agreements for the Chief Executive Officer.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe combination and allocation of the components and the target amount of each component is influenced by the role of the executive officer, individual performance, expected contributions, market practices, and the total value of all the compensation and benefits available to the individual executive officers. The Compensation Committee reviews and considers each component for each executive officer before making compensation decisions. Consistent with our historical practice, we weighted the mix of compensation more towards base salary and long-term equity incentive plans and to a lesser extent short-term cash bonuses or short-term equity awards as discussed below. \n\nCompensation Element Detail \n\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 the elements of compensation based on the amounts in the Summary Compensation Table for our CEO and Named Executive Officers was as follows: \n\nOfficer| ​| ​| Salary(1)| ​| ​| Bonus| ​| ​| Restricted Stock Awards   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMichael Murray| ​| ​| 48.4%| ​| ​| 15.8%| ​| ​| 35.8%   \n  \n18\n\nOfficer| ​| ​| Salary(1)| ​| ​| Bonus| ​| ​| Restricted Stock Awards   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nRichard Sneider| ​| ​| 78.7%| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 21.3%   \nPaul Baker| ​| ​| 77.7%| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 22.3%  \n(1)| Includes “All Other Compensation” for Mr. Murray, Mr. Sneider and Mr. Baker of $10,357, $10,211 and $10,145, respectively. Amounts represent the Company’s matching contributions under the Company’s 401(k) Plan of $8,700 per year and premiums paid for life insurance.   \n---|---  \n  \nSalary \n\nWe believe that establishing an appropriate level of annual base salary for our executives is an important element in retaining and motivating our executive officers. In determining base salaries for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers the responsibilities of each position, cost of living adjustments and the skills and experience required for each job. The Compensation Committee’s determinations are influenced heavily by the evaluations and performance reviews for each executive officer by our Chief Executive Officer, as discussed above. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews the peer group benchmarking analysis, if performed, and finally, reviews total compensation for reasonableness prior to making any final determinations. \n\nThe following table summarizes the base salaries for 2023: \n\nOfficer | ​| ​| Salary   \n---|---|---|---  \nMr. Murray| ​| ​| $450,000   \nMr. Sneider| ​| ​| $349,048   \nMr. Baker| ​| ​| $324,450  \n  \nAnnual Bonus and Incentives \n\nFor fiscal year 2023, we believed that a restricted stock grant that could be earned by achieving certain financial metrics would provide greater incentive than a cash bonus and align our management with shareholders’ interests. We believe that there are larger companies that have wider-range and more complicated reward programs that, due to our size and development stage, we cannot afford to offer. We believe our executive officers are drawn in part to a smaller company such as ours for the potential wealth that can be created by growing our company. This potential wealth is more likely created through our equity-based incentive compensation plan. We therefore use annual incentive awards to provide some element of a more immediate reward to motivate our executives. \n\nFor fiscal year 2023 the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Murray a $150,000 bonus. For fiscal year 2023 no cash bonus was awarded by the Compensation Committee to the other NEOs. \n\nFor fiscal 2023 Messrs. Murray, Sneider and Baker received 107,500, 83,000, and 74,800 shares of restricted stock, respectively, which could have been earned if certain fiscal year 2023 revenue, cash flow targets and individual goals were met. The revenue and cash flow goals had a minimum base amount, a targets amount and a maximum upper goal amount. If the minimum base amount was achieved approximately 30% of the shares could be earned, if the target amount was achieved approximately 75% of the shares could be earned and if the maximum upper goals was achieved all of the shares could be earned. If the base amount was not achieved, then no restricted stock was earned. \n\nMessrs. Murray, Sneider and Baker earned 102,345, 79,020 and 71,213, respectively, of the shares granted which represents achieving approximately 95% of the goals. \n\nLong-Term Incentives \n\nWe believe that including an equity-based incentive component of compensation is a critical tool for motivating our executives and certain employees. We believe that granting equity awards to our executives aligns executive compensation with long-term stockholder value. By awarding executive officers with equity awards that vest over time, we believe that our executive officers will have a continuing stake in our long-term success and these awards serve as an important retention program. \n\nWe weighted our total executive compensation towards restricted stock awards that either vest upon the achievement of certain milestones or vest over time. While our management can improve our financial \n\n19\n\nperformance through the sales of our current products, cost reduction efforts, process improvements and other short-term advancements, we believe that our executive officers’ focus on long-term achievements, particularly increasing our product and patent portfolios, will create the greatest stockholder value. We believe that by granting our executives meaningful levels of equity awards that vest both in the short- and long-term we will achieve the proper balance between incentivizing them to focus on the current fiscal year’s results and longer- term strategies of the Company. \n\nIn determining the size of each equity award granted to our executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers: \n\n•| the amount previously awarded on an annual basis to the executive,   \n---|---  \n•| recommendations from the compensation consultant,   \n---|---  \n•| the total value of unvested equity awards held by the executive, and   \n---|---  \n•| the executive’s overall performance, our performance during the year and the dilution to the stockholders.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn 2023, we granted Messrs. Murray, Sneider and Baker 100,000, 60,000 and 60,000 of restricted stock that vest on the first three December 10ths following the grant date (May 25, 2023). \n\nIn 2023 we granted our Board and employees an aggregate of 3,423,531 shares of restricted common stock of the Company of which 1,892,737 could be earned based on achieving milestones in fiscal year 2023. \n\nPerquisites \n\nThe Company does not offer any perquisites for the exclusive benefit of the NEOs. Our healthcare, insurance and other welfare and employee-benefit programs are the same for all eligible domestic employees, including executive officers. Benefits provided include health and dental coverage, group term life insurance, disability programs and matching contributions to our 401(k) plan. We share the cost of health and welfare benefits with our employees, a cost that is dependent on the level of benefits coverage that each employee elects. The benefits provided to foreign employees are typically determined by the laws of the applicable country they reside in. We have no outstanding loans of any kind to our executive officers. \n\nClawback Policy \n\nWe have a Clawback Policy that provides that performance-based compensation is recoverable from an executive officer if the Board determines that an officer has engaged in knowing or intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct that caused or substantially caused the need for a restatement of the Company’s financial results. Performance-based compensation includes cash payments and any other awards pursuant to any Company incentive plan made on or after January 1, 2009 where payment was predicated on achieving certain financial results. If the Board or an authorized committee determines that any such performance-based compensation would have been at a lower amount had it been based on the restated financial results, the Company will, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment from such officer of the portion of such performance-based compensation that is greater than that which would have been awarded or earned had such compensation been calculated on the basis of the restated financial results. \n\nEmployment and Other Agreements \n\nOn September 5, 2022, John C.C. Fan, the Company’s then President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, notified the Company of his resignation as President and CEO effective September 6, 2022. Under the terms of his previous employment agreement Dr. Fan received $750,000 of severance payments for the fiscal year 2023 and he will receive another $750,000 for fiscal year 2024. In addition, Dr. Fan received $40,000 for medical benefits for fiscal year 2023 and he (or his spouse) will receive $40,000 through 2032. \n\nIn September 2022, Mr. Michael Murray joined Kopin as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Murray’s compensation was as follows: Mr. Murray received an annual base salary of $450,000. Additionally, Mr. Murray received 800,000 shares of restricted stock, which vest in 20% increments each December 10 beginning in 2023, and a sign-on bonus of $100,000. Mr. Murray is entitled to an annual \n\n20\n\nperformance-based bonus opportunity in the form of cash and long-term awards, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Murray also is eligible for the Company’s standard benefits package and to participate in all applicable group employee benefit plans and programs offered. In 2023, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Murray a $150,000 bonus for performance in 2022.\n\nOn April 15, 2024 the Company and Mr. Murray signed a new Employment Agreement (the “New Agreement”). This summary of the New Agreement is subject to the terms of the New Agreement which is filed with the SEC as an exhibit to Form 8-K. Under the New Agreement, Mr. Murray’s salary was set at $495,000 with eligibility for a target bonus of 100% of base salary up to a maximum of 150% base salary based on a formula and the determination of achievement of goals as determined by the Board. Mr. Murray also is eligible for the Company’s standard benefits package and to participate in all applicable group employee benefit plans and programs offered. Mr. Murray is eligible to receive equity awards covering the Company’s common stock. As of the effective date of the New Agreement, Mr. Murray is no longer eligible to participate in the executive stock program applicable to other senior executives of the Company. Provided that Mr. Murray continues to be employed by the Company on the date of a change of control (as defined in the New Agreement), all outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Murray immediately prior to the effective date of a change of control which vest based upon his continued service over time shall accelerate, become fully vested and/or exercisable, as the case may be, immediately prior to the change of control, and all outstanding equity awards held immediately prior to the change of control which vest based upon attainment of performance criteria shall vest based on target performance immediately prior to the change of control.\n\nSubject to continued employment on the grant date, Mr. Murray is eligible for a performance-based award with a target of 1,000,000 RSUs, which will vest based on attainment of corporate performance goals and targets established by the Board in its sole discretion, after consultation with Mr. Murray and his continued employment through December 31, 2026 (“2026 Performance-Based Equity Award”). The Board has the discretion to modify the performance goals and targets during the performance period to account for certain irregular, nonrecurring or one-time items in order to maintain alignment with shareholders’ interests in the Board’s sole discretion. If any of the applicable performance goals are attained at less than 80% of target, the number of RSUs earned for the portion of the 2026 Performance-Based Equity Award attributable to that performance goal will be zero. If any of the applicable performance goals are attained at between 80% and 100% of target, the number of RSUs earned for the portion of the 2026 Performance-Based Equity Award attributable to that performance goal will be between 50% and 100% of target. If any of the applicable performance goals are attained at between 100% and 120% of target, the number of RSUs earned for the portion of the 2026 Performance-Based Equity Award attributable to that performance goal will be between 100% and 120% of target. Performance achievement will be determined by the Board in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith in 2027 based on the audited financials for fiscal year 2026, and in no event will the 2026 Performance-Based Equity Award be earned at greater than 120% of target. Performance between performance levels for financial goals will be interpolated on a straight-line basis. The Board has the discretion to grant an additional performance based equity award following the 2026 fiscal year. The Company may terminate Mr. Murray’s employment at any time without cause or Mr. Murray may terminate his employment at any time for good reason. Upon termination by the Company without cause or by Mr. Murray with good reason, whether before or after the Change of Control Protection Period (as defined in the New Agreement), if Mr. Murray executes and does not revoke a written release (as defined in the New Agreement), Mr. Murray shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of any payments under any severance plan or program for employees or executives, the following:\n\nThe Company will pay Mr. Murray an amount equal to six months of Base Salary at the rate in effect immediately prior to the termination date. Payment shall be made over the six-month period following the termination date in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices. Payment will begin within 60 days following the termination date, and any installments not paid between the termination date and the date of the first payment will be paid with the first payment.\n\nProvided that he is eligible for and timely elects continuation coverage under COBRA, the Company will pay directly to the COBRA administrator the COBRA premiums required to maintain Mr. Murray’s continued health care coverage under the Company’s group health plans that he participated in on the date of termination (“COBRA Payments”). The Company will pay the COBRA Payments for the period from his termination date until the earliest to occur of (i) the end of the six-month period following the termination date; (ii) the date he becomes eligible for group health insurance coverage through a subsequent employer; or (iii) the date he ceases \n\n21\n\nto be eligible for COBRA coverage for any reason (each of the events described in (ii) or (iii) a “Disqualifying Event”. Mr. Murray is required to notify the Company within five days of becoming aware that a Disqualifying Event has occurred or will occur. The COBRA health care continuation coverage period under section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), shall run concurrently with the period during which the Company pays the COBRA Payments.\n\nThe Company shall pay any earned, accrued, and owing Base Salary up until the date of termination and any benefits accrued and due under any applicable benefit plans and programs of the Company.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, upon termination by the Company without Cause or by the Mr. Murray with Good Reason on or within six months preceding or 15 months following a Change of Control (the “Change of Control Protection Period”), and provided that Mr. Murray executes and does not revoke a written Release, then he shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of certain payments or any severance plan or program for employees or executives the following:\n\n(a)| The Company will pay an amount equal to 12 months Base Salary at the rate in effect immediately prior to the termination date (but not less than $495,000 in the aggregate). Payment shall be made in a lump sum within 60 days following the termination date; provided that such payment shall be made in installments as set forth in Section 6(a) above over the 12-month period following the termination date if the Change of Control is not a “change in control event” as defined under section 409A of the Code and; provided further that in the event Mr. Murray’s employment is terminated as described in this Section 7 on or within six months preceding the Change of Control, payments shall commence and, effective upon the closing of the Change of Control, he shall receive any additional amount less the aggregate amount of installment payments already received.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Provided that he is eligible for and timely elects continuation coverage under COBRA, the Company will pay the COBRA administrator the COBRA Payments for the period from his termination date until the earliest to occur of (i) the end of the 12-month period following the termination date or (ii) a Disqualifying Event. Mr. Murray is required to notify the Company within five days of becoming aware that a Disqualifying Event has occurred or will occur. The COBRA health care continuation coverage period under section 4980B of the Code shall run concurrently with the period during which the Company pays the COBRA Payments.  \n---|---  \n(c)| The Company will pay a prorated target Annual Bonus for the year in which his termination of employment occurs, which amount will be determined by multiplying (i) the full-year target Annual Bonus for the year in which his termination of employment occurs, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during which he was employed by the Company in the fiscal year in which the termination date occurs and the denominator of which is 365. Such prorated target Annual Bonus shall be paid in a lump sum within 60 days following the termination date.   \n---|---  \n  \nOur Equity Plans provide for the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options and restricted stock awards in the event of a change in control. \n\nPolicies Regarding Stock Ownership and Related Matters \n\nWe believe that by holding shares of our common stock and options to purchase our common stock, our executives will have interests that are more closely aligned with those of our stockholders. \n\nWe have share ownership and retention guidelines that require each director of the Company to own shares of our common stock or options to purchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate market value of at least three times the cash component of the director’s annual retainer (excluding committee retainers) for service on the Board. \n\nIn addition, the guidelines require our CEO to own shares of our common stock having an aggregate market value of at least three times his or her annual base salary. Our directors and our CEO have five years from the time they become subject to the stock ownership guidelines to achieve the target ownership thresholds. In 2023, our directors and CEO were on track to maintain compliance with the minimum stock ownership guidelines. \n\nWe have an Insider Trading Policy that governs our officers, directors and employees. The policy imposes limits as to when and how our personnel can engage in transactions in our securities and prohibits short sales of our common stock by all our personnel. All of our officers have established Rule 10b5-1 plans with an \n\n22\n\nindependent broker. These plans typically govern the sale of an officer’s stock when our stock prices meet certain levels. These plans, generally, may only be adjusted during certain times of the year with the Company’s approval. Officers and directors may also sell shares outside a Rule 10b5-1 plan during open windows under our Insider Trading Policy. \n\nTax and Accounting Implications \n\nAs part of its role, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), which generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for certain compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid in any year to a company’s chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated officers. Certain compensation, including qualified performance-based compensation, will not be subject to the deduction limitation if certain requirements are met. Although the Compensation Committee has not adopted any specific policy with respect to the application of Section 162(m), we generally seek to structure any long-term incentive compensation granted to our executive officers in a manner that is intended to avoid disallowance of deductions under Section 162(m). \n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation \n\nAs discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the accounting for stock-based awards requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on the fair value of all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. We are required to account for share-based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share- based payments in our statement of operations. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. \n\nSince 2004 we have only issued restricted stock awards and the fair value of the award is typically based on the closing price of our stock on Nasdaq on the day of grant. All employees are eligible to participate in our equity award program but the number of employees who actually participate annually has been reduced and does not typically include employees who are paid on an hourly basis. \n\nSummary Compensation Table \n\nThe following table summarizes the total compensation for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 of those persons who served as our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our next most highly compensated executive officer for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and our other executive officers for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. We refer to these individuals in this proxy as our named executive officers. \n\nName and Principle Position| ​| ​| Year| ​| ​| Salary ($)| ​| ​| Bonus ($)(1)| ​| ​| Restricted Stock Awards ($)(2)| ​| ​| Option Awards ($)| ​| ​| Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation ($)(3)| ​| ​| Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified DeferredCompensation Earnings ($)(4)| ​| ​| All Other Compensation ($)(5)| ​| ​| Total $   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMichael MurrayPresident and Chief Executive Officer commencing September 2022| ​| ​| 2023| ​| ​| $450,000| ​| ​| $150,000| ​| ​| $340,545| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| $—| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| $10,357| ​| ​| $950,902   \n​| 2022| ​| ​| $128,076| ​| ​| $100,000| ​| ​| $1,032,000| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| $—| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| $3,860| ​| ​| $1,263,936   \nRichard A.

The Board and executive management believe that perquisites for executive officers should be extremely limited in scope and value. As a result, Kopin has historically given nominal perquisites to executive officers, including NEOs.

Our Equity Plans have provisions that may result in the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards as a result of a change in control. In addition, the employment agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer provides for certain post-employment benefits. The table below summarizes the effects on the compensation of our named executive officers as if the termination of employment or change of control provisions of the Equity Plans and employment agreement were triggered on December 30, 2023. \n\nName| ​| ​| Value of Equity Awards if a Change in Control Occurs on12/30/23(1)| ​| ​| Health Care Benefits(2)| ​| ​| Severance Payments   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMichael Murray| ​| ​| $1,727,390| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —   \nRichard A.

Avery and James K. Brewington, each of whom the Board has determined is independent under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Rules. The Board also has determined that Mr. Anchin is an “audit committee financial expert” under applicable SEC rules and regulations. \n\nThe purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its general oversight of the Company’s financial reporting, internal controls and audit functions. The Audit Committee charter, which is available at the Company’s website at www.kopin.com, under the heading “Investors: Corporate Governance,” describes in greater detail the full responsibilities of the Audit Committee. \n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company’s financial statements; accounting and financial reporting principles; establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)); establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)); evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures; evaluating the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and evaluating any change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. \n\nRSM US LLP (“RSM”), the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has been engaged to perform an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and to express an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and also to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and RSM. \n\nDuring the course of the 2023 fiscal year, management completed the documentation, testing and evaluation of the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the requirements set forth in Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations. The Audit Committee was kept apprised of the progress of the evaluation and provided oversight and advice to management during this process. In connection with this oversight, the Audit Committee also received periodic updates provided by management and Stowe & Degon LLC, an independent registered public accounting firm that the Company uses for internal controls review, at regularly scheduled Audit Committee meetings. At the conclusion of the process, management provided the Audit Committee with, and the Audit Committee reviewed, a report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also received a report of results from \n\n33\n\nStowe & Degon LLC. The Audit Committee also reviewed the report of management contained in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC, as well as RSM’s Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K related to its audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. In conjunction, the Audit Committee continues to oversee the Company’s efforts related to its internal control over financial reporting and management’s preparations for the evaluation in fiscal year 2024. \n\nThe Committee has discussed with RSM the matters that are required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), including Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, “Communication with Audit Committees,” as amended, and as adopted by the PCAOB, as well as Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X of the SEC “Communication with Audit Committees.” RSM has also provided to the Committee its letter required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, “Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence,” and the Committee discussed with RSM the firm’s independence. \n\nBased on its review and the discussion noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2023 be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year for filing with the SEC. \n\n​| ​| AUDIT COMMITTEE  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​  \n​| ​| Scott L.

Brewington  \n  \n34\n\nPROPOSAL 2\n\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY’S 2020 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN \n\nThe Equity Incentive Plan Amendment Proposal— The Board has authorized, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 EIP”) to increase the number of shares available under the 2020 EIP by 3,000,000 shares (the “Plan Amendment”). Currently, the 2020 EIP authorizes the issuance of up to 11,000,000 shares of common stock. \n\nThe purpose of the 2020 EIP is to encourage ownership of the Company’s common stock by key employees and to provide additional incentive for such employees to promote the success of the Company’s business. The Board believes that the 2020 EIP: \n\n•| Aligns the long-term interests of key employees and stockholders by creating a direct link between key employee compensation and stockholder return;   \n---|---  \n•| Enables key employees to develop and maintain a meaningful stock ownership in the Company; and   \n---|---  \n•| Provides incentives for key employees to contribute to the success of the Company.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Plan Amendment is being submitted to stockholders for approval. A copy of the 2020 EIP as it is proposed to be amended is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to approve the Plan Amendment to increase the number of shares available under the 2020 EIP by 3,000,000. \n\nA total of 14,000,000 shares of Kopin common stock will be reserved for issuance under the amended 2020 EIP. As of March 28, 2024, the closing price on Nasdaq per share of common stock was $1.80. Our Board approved the Plan Amendment on March 5, 2024, subject to approval by Kopin’s stockholders. The Plan Amendment will be effective upon approval by Kopin’s stockholders. \n\nReasons for the Amendment to the 2020 EIP \n\nEquity incentive compensation programs play a pivotal role in Kopin’s efforts to attract and retain key personnel essential to Kopin’s long-term growth and financial success. We are asking our stockholders to approve the Plan Amendment to assist Kopin in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. If our stockholders do not approve the Plan Amendment, we will be limited in our ability to continue to issue awards in numbers sufficient to attract and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to recruit and retain, due to low share reserves remaining in our 2020 EIP and the dilution to our share reserve and outstanding equity awards from the increase in our stock outstanding from recent financing activities, and our employees’ motivation and incentives will be negatively affected. \n\nOffering a broad-based equity compensation program is vital to attracting and retaining highly skilled people in the highly competitive technology industry. We use equity awards to increase incentives on the part of employees, non-employee directors and consultants who provide significant services to the Company. We believe that providing an equity stake in the future success of our business encourages our employees to be highly motivated to achieve our long-term business goals and to increase stockholder value. Their innovation and productivity are critical to our success. Accordingly, approving the Plan Amendment is in the best interest of our stockholders because equity awards help us to: \n\n•| attract, motivate and retain talented employees and directors;   \n---|---  \n•| align employee and stockholder interests; and   \n---|---  \n•| link employee compensation with Kopin’s performance.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe strongly believe that approval of the Plan Amendment will enable us to achieve our goals in attracting and retaining our most valuable asset: our employees. \n\nWithout the appropriate share reserve to grant competitive equity-based incentives, we would be forced to consider cash replacement alternatives to provide a market-competitive total compensation package necessary to attract, retain and motivate the employee talent critical to our future successes. These cash replacement \n\n35\n\nalternatives could, among other things, reduce the cash available for investment in growth and development and cause a loss of motivation by employees to achieve superior performance over a longer period of time. Equity- based incentives, by contrast, directly align a portion of the compensation of our employees with the economic interests of our stockholders. \n\nFor that reason, Kopin has structured the 2020 EIP to provide flexibility in designing equity incentive programs with a broad array of equity incentives, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and restricted stock units and implement competitive incentive compensation programs for its employees and non-employee Board members. The 2020 EIP will continue to be the only plan under which new equity awards may be granted to our employees and other service providers. If this Proposal 2 is not approved, then we would be at a disadvantage against our competitors for recruiting, retaining and motivating individuals critical to our success and could be forced to increase cash compensation, thereby reducing resources available to meet our business needs. \n\nAs of March 31, 2024, 7,357,654 shares of common stock had been issued pursuant to awards under the 2020 EIP. All awards outstanding under the 2020 EIP on the date of the Plan Amendment will continue to be governed solely by the terms of the documents evidencing such awards, and no provision of the Plan Amendment will be deemed to affect or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of such transferred awards. \n\nIn connection with our stock-based compensation programs, we are committed to using equity incentive awards prudently and within reasonable limits. We anticipate that the share reserve under the amended 2020 EIP, will enable us to fund our equity compensation program for approximately two years. While we believe this is a reasonable estimate of how long the share reserve would last, the actual period for which the proposed share reserve will fund our equity compensation program may be shorter or longer than expected, depending on changes in our granting practices, stock price and headcount growth. \n\nSummary Description of the Kopin Corporation 2020 Equity Incentive Plan \n\nThe following is a summary of the principal provisions of the 2020 EIP. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2020 EIP. \n\nTypes of Awards \n\nThe 2020 EIP provides for the issuance of stock options (including non-statutory stock options and incentive stock option), stock appreciation rights (referred to as “SARs”), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock bonuses and other stock-based awards to officers, employees, non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants of Kopin Corporation or its affiliates. \n\nPurpose and Types of Grants \n\nThe purpose of the 2020 EIP is to attract and retain employees, non-employee directors and consultants, and advisors. The 2020 EIP provides for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock awards, stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. The 2020 EIP is intended to provide an incentive to participants to contribute to our economic success by aligning the economic interests of participants with those of our stockholders. \n\nAdministration \n\nThe 2020 EIP is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board, and the Compensation Committee will determine all of the terms and conditions applicable to grants under the 2020 EIP. Our Compensation Committee determines who receives grants under the 2020 EIP and the number of shares of common stock that will be subject to grants, except that grants to members of our Board must be authorized by a majority of our Board. Our Compensation Committee may delegate authority under the 2020 EIP to one or more subcommittees as it deems appropriate. Subject to compliance with applicable law and stock exchange requirements, the Compensation Committee (or our Board or a subcommittee, as applicable) may delegate all or part of its authority to our Chief Executive Officer, as it deems appropriate, with respect to grants to employees or key advisors who are not executive officers under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Our Compensation Committee, our Board, any subcommittee or the Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, that has authority with respect to a specific grant will be referred to as “the committee” in this description of the 2020 EIP. \n\n36\n\nShares Subject to the Plan \n\nSubject to adjustment, our 2020 EIP currently authorizes the issuance or transfer of up to 11,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, shares of common stock underlying any outstanding award granted under the Prior Plan that, following the effective date of the 2020 EIP, expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of such shares shall be available for new grants under the 2020 EIP. \n\nIf any options or SARs expire or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without having been exercised, or if any stock awards, stock units or other stock-based awards are forfeited, terminated or otherwise not paid in full, the shares of our common stock subject to such awards will again be available for purposes of the 2020 EIP. If shares of our common stock are surrendered in payment of the exercise price of an option, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 EIP will be reduced only by the net number of shares actually issued by us upon such exercise and not by the gross number of shares as to which such option is exercised. Upon the exercise of any SAR under the 2020 EIP, the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance will be reduced only by the net number of shares actually issued by us upon such exercise. \n\nIf shares of our common stock are withheld by us in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, vesting or exercise of any grant or the issuance of our common stock under the 2020 EIP, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance will be reduced by the net number of shares issued, vested or exercised under such grant, calculated in each instance after payment of such share withholding. If any awards are paid in cash, and not in shares of our common stock, any shares of our common stock subject to such awards will also be available for future awards. If we repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market with the proceeds from the exercise price we receive from options, the repurchased shares will not be available for issuance under the 2020 EIP. \n\nIndividual Limits for Non-Employee Directors \n\nThe maximum aggregate grant date value of shares of common stock granted to any non-employee director in any one calendar year, taken together with any cash fees earned by such non-employee director for services rendered during the calendar year, shall not exceed $250,000 in total value. \n\nAdjustments \n\nIn connection with stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and certain other events affecting our common stock, the committee will make adjustments as it deems appropriate in: the maximum number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance as grants; the maximum amount of awards that may be granted to any individual non-employee director in any year; the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding grants; the number and kind of shares that may be issued under the 2020 EIP; the price per share or market value of any outstanding grants; the exercise price of options; the base amount of stock appreciation rights; and the performance goals or other terms and conditions as the committee deems appropriate. \n\nEligibility and Vesting \n\nAll of our employees are eligible to receive grants under the 2020 EIP. In addition, our non-employee directors and key advisors who perform services for us may receive grants under the 2020 EIP. The committee determines the vesting and exercisability terms of awards granted under the 2020 EIP. \n\nOptions \n\nUnder our 2020 EIP, the committee determines the exercise price of the options granted and may grant options to purchase shares of our common stock in such amounts as it determines. The committee may grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, or non-qualified stock options, which are not intended to so qualify. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Anyone eligible to participate in the 2020 EIP may receive a grant of non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of a stock option granted under the 2020 EIP cannot be less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date the option is granted. If an incentive stock option is granted to a 10% stockholder of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, the exercise price cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date the option is granted. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued or transferred under the 2020 EIP pursuant to incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code may not exceed 10% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the effective date of the 2020 EIP. \n\n37\n\nThe exercise price for any option is generally payable in cash. In certain circumstances as permitted by the committee, the exercise price may be paid: by the surrender of shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair market value, on the date the option is exercised, equal to the exercise price; by payment through a broker in accordance with procedures established by the Federal Reserve Board; by withholding shares of common stock subject to the exercisable option that have a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price; or by such other method as the committee approves. \n\nThe term of an option cannot exceed ten years from the date of grant, except that if an incentive stock option is granted to a 10% stockholder of the total combined voting power of all class of our stock, the term cannot exceed five years from the date of grant. In the event that on the last day of the term of a non-qualified stock option, the exercise is prohibited by applicable law, including a prohibition on purchases or sales of our common stock under our insider trading policy, the term of the non-qualified option will be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, unless the committee determines otherwise. \n\nExcept as provided in the grant instrument, an option may only be exercised while a participant is employed by or providing service to us. The committee will determine in the grant instrument under what circumstances and during what time periods a participant may exercise an option after termination of employment. \n\nStock Awards \n\nUnder the 2020 EIP, the committee may grant stock awards. A stock award is an award of our common stock that may be subject to restrictions as the committee determines. The restrictions, if any, may lapse over a specified period of employment or based on the satisfaction of pre-established criteria, in installments or otherwise, as the committee may determine, including, but not limited to, restrictions based on the achievement of performance goals. Except to the extent restricted under the grant instrument relating to the stock award, a participant will have all of the rights of a stockholder as to those shares, including the right to vote and the right to receive dividends or distributions on the shares. Dividends with respect to stock awards that vest based on performance shall vest if and to the extent that the underlying stock award vests, as determined by the committee. All unvested stock awards are forfeited if the participant’s employment or service is terminated for any reason, unless the committee determines otherwise. \n\nStock Units \n\nUnder the 2020 EIP, the committee may grant stock units to anyone eligible to participate in the 2020 EIP. Stock units represent hypothetical shares of our common stock. Stock units become payable on terms and conditions determined by the committee, including specified performance goals, and will be payable in cash, shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, as determined by the committee. All unvested stock units are forfeited if the participant’s employment or service is terminated for any reason, unless the committee determines otherwise. \n\nStock Appreciation Rights \n\nUnder the 2020 EIP, the committee may grant SARs, which may be granted separately or in tandem with any option. SARs granted in tandem with a non-qualified stock option may be granted either at the time the non- qualified stock option is granted or any time thereafter while the option remains outstanding. SARs granted in tandem with an incentive stock option may be granted only at the time the grant of the incentive stock option is made. The committee will establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted, which will be equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of our common stock as of the date of grant. \n\nIf a SAR is granted in tandem with an option, the number of SARs that are exercisable during a specified period will not exceed the number of shares of our common stock that the participant may purchase upon exercising the related option during such period. Upon exercising the related option, the related SARs will terminate, and upon the exercise of a SAR, the related option will terminate to the extent of an equal number of shares of our common stock. Generally, SARs may only be exercised while the participant is employed by, or providing services to, us. When a participant exercises a SAR, the participant will receive the excess of the fair market value of the underlying common stock over the base amount of the SAR. The appreciation of a SAR will be paid in shares of our common stock, cash or both. \n\nThe term of a SAR cannot exceed ten years from the date of grant. In the event that on the last day of the term of a SAR, the exercise is prohibited by applicable law, including a prohibition on purchases or sales of our \n\n38\n\ncommon stock under our insider trading policy, the term of the SAR will be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, unless the committee determines otherwise. \n\nOther Stock-Based Awards \n\nUnder the 2020 EIP, the committee may grant other types of awards that are based on, or measured by, our common stock, and granted to anyone eligible to participate in the 2020 EIP. The committee will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. Other stock-based awards may be payable in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of the two, as determined by the committee. \n\nDividend Equivalents \n\nUnder the 2020 EIP, the committee may grant dividend equivalents in connection with grants of stock units or other stock-based awards made under the 2020 EIP. Dividend equivalents entitle the participant to receive amounts equal to ordinary dividends that are paid on the shares underlying a grant while the grant is outstanding. The committee will determine whether dividend equivalents will be paid currently or accrued as contingent cash obligations. Dividend equivalents may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock. The committee will determine the terms and conditions of the dividend equivalent grants, including whether the grants are payable upon the achievement of specific performance goals. Dividend equivalents with respect to stock units or other stock-based awards that vest based on performance shall vest and be paid only if and to the extent that the underlying stock units or other stock-based awards vest and are paid as determined by the committee. \n\nProhibition on Repricing \n\nUnder the terms of the 2020 EIP, the committee may not (i) amend the terms of any outstanding stock options or SARs to reduce the exercise price or base price, as applicable, (ii) cancel outstanding stock options or SARs in exchange for stock options or SARs with an exercise price or base price, as applicable, that is less than the exercise price or base price of the original stock options or SARs or (iii) cancel outstanding stock options or SARs with an exercise price or base price, as applicable, above the current stock price in exchange for cash or other securities, except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company, without in each such instance obtaining the approval of our stockholders. \n\nChange of Control \n\nIf we experience a change of control where we are not the surviving corporation (or survive only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the committee determines otherwise, all outstanding grants that are not exercised or paid at the time of the change of control will be assumed by, or replaced with grants (with respect to cash, securities or a combination thereof) that have comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). \n\nUnless otherwise set forth in a grant instrument, if a participant is terminated without cause upon or within 12 months of a change of control, all outstanding time-based awards shall become fully vested. \n\nIf there is a change of control and all outstanding grants are not assumed by, or replaced with grants that have comparable terms by the surviving corporation, the committee may (but is not obligated to) make adjustments to the terms and conditions of outstanding grants, including, without limitation, taking any of the following actions (or combination thereof) without the consent of any participant: \n\n•| determine that outstanding options and SARs will accelerate and become fully exercisable and the restrictions and conditions on outstanding stock awards, stock units and dividend equivalents immediately lapse;   \n---|---  \n•| pay participants, in an amount and form determined by the committee, in settlement of outstanding stock units or dividend equivalents;   \n---|---  \n•| require that participants surrender their outstanding stock options and SARs in exchange for a payment by us, in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock; provided, however, if the per share   \n---|---  \n  \n39\n\n•| fair market value of our common stock does not exceed the per share stock option exercise price or stock appreciation right base amount, as applicable, we will not be required to make any payment to the participant upon surrender of the stock option or stock appreciation right; or   \n---|---  \n•| after giving participants an opportunity to exercise all of their outstanding stock options and SARs, terminate any unexercised stock options and SARs on the date determined by the committee.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn general terms, a change of control under the 2020 EIP occurs if: \n\n•| a person, entity or affiliated group, with certain exceptions, acquires more than 50% of our then- outstanding voting securities;   \n---|---  \n•| we merge into another entity unless the holders of our voting shares immediately prior to the merger have at least 50% of the combined voting power of the securities in the merged entity or its parent;   \n---|---  \n•| we merge into another entity and the members of our Board prior to the merger would not constitute a majority of the board of the merged entity or its parent;   \n---|---  \n•| we sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;   \n---|---  \n•| we consummate a complete liquidation or dissolution; or   \n---|---  \n•| a majority of the members of our Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the incumbent directors.   \n---|---  \n  \nDeferrals \n\nThe committee may permit or require participants to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of shares of common stock that would otherwise be due to the participant in connection with a grant under the 2020 EIP. The committee will establish the rules and procedures applicable to any such deferrals, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. \n\nWithholding \n\nAll grants under the 2020 EIP are subject to applicable U.S. federal (including FICA), state and local, foreign or other tax withholding requirements. We may require participants or other persons receiving grants or exercising grants to pay an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding requirements with respect to such grants, or we may deduct from other wages and compensation paid by us the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such grant. \n\nThe committee may permit or require that our tax withholding obligation with respect to grants paid in our common stock be paid by having shares withheld up to an amount that does not exceed the participant’s minimum applicable withholding tax rate for United States federal (including FICA), state and local tax liabilities, or as otherwise determined by the committee. In addition, the committee may, in its discretion, and subject to such rules as the committee may adopt, allow participants to elect to have such share withholding applied to all or a portion of the tax withholding obligation arising in connection with any particular grant. \n\nTransferability \n\nExcept as permitted by the committee with respect to non-qualified stock options, only a participant may exercise rights under a grant during the participant’s lifetime. Upon death, the personal representative or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the participant may exercise such rights. A participant cannot transfer those rights except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or, with respect to grants other than incentive stock options, pursuant to a domestic relations order. The committee may provide in a grant instrument that a participant may transfer non-qualified stock options and stock award to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members, consistent with applicable securities laws. \n\nAmendment; Termination \n\nOur Board may amend or terminate our 2020 EIP at any time, except that our stockholders must approve an amendment if such approval is required in order to comply with the Code, applicable laws or applicable stock exchange requirements. Unless terminated sooner by our Board or extended with stockholder approval, the 2020 EIP will terminate on the day immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2020 EIP. \n\n40\n\nStockholder Approval \n\nExcept in connection with certain corporate transactions, including stock dividends, stock splits, a recapitalization, a change in control, a reorganization, a merger and a spin-off, stockholder approval is required (i) to reduce the exercise price or base price of outstanding stock options or SARs, (ii) to cancel outstanding stock options or SARs in exchange for the same type of grant with a lower exercise price or base price, and (iii) to cancel outstanding stock options or SARs that have an exercise price or base price above the current price of a share of our common stock, in exchange for cash or other securities, each as applicable. \n\nEstablishment of Sub-Plans \n\nOur Board may, from time to time, establish one or more sub-plans under the 2020 EIP to satisfy applicable blue sky, securities or tax laws of various jurisdictions. Our Board may establish such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the 2020 EIP setting forth limitations on the committee’s discretion and such additional terms and conditions not otherwise inconsistent with the 2020 EIP as our Board deems necessary or desirable. All such supplements will be deemed part of the 2020 EIP, but each supplement will only apply to participants within the affected jurisdiction, and we will not be required to provide copies of any supplement to such unaffected participants. \n\nClawback \n\nSubject to applicable law, the committee may provide in any grant instrument that if a participant breaches any restrictive covenant agreement between the participant and us, or otherwise engages in activities that constitute cause (as defined in the 2020 EIP) either while employed by, or providing services to, us or within a specified period of time thereafter, all grants held by the participant will terminate, and we may rescind any exercise of an option or stock appreciation right and the vesting of any other grant and delivery of shares upon such exercise or vesting, as applicable on such terms as the committee will determine, including the right to require that in the event of any rescission: \n\n•| the participant must return the shares received upon the exercise of any option or stock appreciation right or the vesting and payment of any other grants; or   \n---|---  \n•| if the participant no longer owns the shares, the participant must pay to us the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of any sale or other disposition of the shares (if the participant transferred the shares by gift or without consideration, then the fair market value of the shares on the date of the breach of the restrictive covenant agreement or activity constituting cause), net of the price originally paid by the participant for the shares.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe committee may also provide for clawbacks pursuant to a clawback policy, which our Board may in the future adopt and amend from time to time. Payment by the participant will be made in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required by the committee. We will be entitled to set off against the amount of any such payment any amounts that we otherwise owe to the participant. \n\nCertain United States Federal Income Tax Aspects \n\nThe following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards under the 2020 EIP. It does not purport to be a complete description of all applicable rules, and those rules (including those summarized here) are subject to change. \n\nOptions \n\nAn optionee generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of a non-statutory option. Rather, at the time of exercise of the option, the optionee will recognize ordinary income for income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares purchased over the exercise price. We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at such time and in the same amount, if any, that the optionee recognizes as ordinary income. The optionee’s tax basis in any shares received upon exercise of an option will be the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and if the shares are later sold or exchanged, then the difference between the amount received upon such sale or exchange and the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise will generally be taxable as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss (if the shares are a capital asset of the optionee) depending upon the length of time such shares were held by the optionee. \n\n41\n\nIncentive stock options are eligible for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment if certain requirements are satisfied. An incentive stock option must have an option price that is not less than the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is granted and must be exercisable within ten years from the date of grant. An employee granted an incentive stock option generally does not realize compensation income for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the grant of the option. At the time of exercise of an incentive stock option, no compensation income is realized by the optionee other than tax preference income for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax on individual income. If the shares acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option are held for at least two years after grant of the option and one year after exercise, the excess of the amount realized on the sale over the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain. If the shares acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option are disposed of within less than two years after grant or one year of exercise, the optionee will realize taxable compensation income equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the option price or (ii) the excess of the amount realized on the sale over the option price. Any additional amount realized will be taxed as capital gain. \n\nStock Awards \n\nA participant generally will not be taxed upon the grant of stock awards subject to restrictions, but rather will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time the shares are no longer subject to a “substantial risk of forfeiture” (within the meaning of the Code). We generally will be entitled to a deduction at the time when, and in the amount that, the participant recognizes ordinary income on account of the lapse of the restrictions. A participant’s tax basis in the shares will equal their fair market value at the time the restrictions lapse, and the participant’s holding period for capital gains purposes will begin at that time. Any cash dividends paid on the restricted stock before the restrictions lapse will be taxable to the participant as additional compensation (and not as dividend income). Under Section 83(b) of the Code, a participant may elect to recognize ordinary income at the time the shares of stock are awarded in an amount equal to their fair market value at that time, notwithstanding the fact that such shares of stock are subject to restrictions and a substantial risk of forfeiture. If such an election is made, no additional taxable income will be recognized by such participant at the time the restrictions lapse, the participant will have a tax basis in the shares equal to their fair market value on the date of their award, and the participant’s holding period for capital gains purposes will begin at that time. We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at the time when, and to the extent that, ordinary income is recognized by such participant. \n\nStock Units \n\nIn general, the grant of stock units will not result in income for the participant or in a tax deduction for us. Upon the settlement of such an award in cash or shares, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the aggregate value of the payment received, and we generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and in the same amount. \n\nStock Appreciation Rights \n\nA participant who is granted a SAR generally will not recognize ordinary income upon receipt of the SAR. Rather, at the time of exercise of such SAR, the participant will recognize ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the value of any cash received and the fair market value on the date of exercise of any shares received. We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at such time and in the same amount, if any, that the participant recognizes as ordinary income. The participant’s tax basis in any shares received upon exercise of a SAR will be the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and if the shares are later sold or exchanged, then the difference between the amount received upon such sale or exchange and the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise will generally be taxable as long-term or short- term capital gain or loss (if the shares are a capital asset of the participant) depending upon the length of time such shares were held by the participant. \n\nOther Awards \n\nWith respect to other stock-based awards granted under the 2020 EIP, generally when the participant receives payment with respect to an award, the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any shares or other property received will be ordinary income to the participant, and we generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and in the same amount. \n\n42\n\nImpact of Section 409A \n\nSection 409A of the Code applies to deferred compensation, which is generally defined as compensation earned currently, the payment of which is deferred to a later taxable year. Awards under the 2020 EIP are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A or to satisfy its requirements. An award that is subject to Section 409A and fails to satisfy its requirements will subject the holder of the award to immediate taxation, interest and an additional 20% tax on the vested amount underlying the award. \n\nSection 162(m) of the Code \n\nPrior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code imposed a $1 million limit on the amount a public company may deduct for compensation paid to a company’s chief executive officer or any of the company’s three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) who are employed as of the end of the year. This limitation did not apply to compensation that meets the tax code requirements for “qualifying performance-based” compensation (i.e., compensation paid only if the individual’s performance meets pre- established objective goals based on performance criteria approved by stockholders, including stock options). \n\nThe performance-based compensation exemption and the exemption of the chief financial officer from Section 162(m)’s deduction limit have been repealed, among other changes, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that awards paid to our covered executive officers (including our chief executive officer) in excess of $1 million will not be deductible in future years, unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements that were in effect as of November 2, 2017 and are not materially modified thereafter. \n\nAs in prior years, while deductibility of executive compensation for federal income tax purposes is among the factors the committee considers when structuring our executive compensation arrangements, it is not the sole or primary factor considered. We retain the flexibility to authorize compensation that may not be deductible if we believe it is in the best interests of the company. \n\nExisting Plan Benefits \n\nFuture benefits under the 2020 EIP generally are granted at the discretion of the committee and are therefore not currently determinable. \n\nBecause future grants of awards under the 2020 EIP are subject to the discretion of the Board or Compensation Committee, the amount and terms of future awards to particular participants or groups of participants are not determinable at this time. No awards have been previously granted that are contingent on the approval of this amendment to the 2020 EIP. \n\nVote Required for Approval \n\nThe proposal to amend the 2020 EIP will be approved upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present through virtual attendance or by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Stockholders may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or “ABSTAIN” from voting. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will be disregarded and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this Proposal 2. \n\nBoard Recommendation \n\nThe Board recommends that the stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the amendment to the Kopin Corporation 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available by 3,000,000.\n\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of Kopin Corporation directors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of Kopin Corporation and its stockholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that stockholders vote for the proposals. \n\n43\n\nPROPOSAL 3\n\nAPPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES FROM 150,000,000 TO 200,000,000 \n\nOur Board has approved the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, subject to stockholder approval, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 150,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares (the “Share Increase Amendment”) and recommends unanimously that our stockholders approve the Share Increase Amendment. The proposed amendment is reflected in the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. As of March 28, 2024, there were 118,438,003 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and the Company had warrants outstanding to acquire 6,000,000 shares of its common stock, leaving a total of 25,561,997 authorized shares of common stock available for future issuance. \n\nThe additional 50,000,000 shares of common stock will be part of the existing class of common stock, and, if and when issued, would have the same rights and privileges as the shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding. \n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation has not been amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock since May 25, 2000, when we effected a stock split that increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 60,000,000 to 120,000,000 shares. \n\nThe Board believes that it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to have a sufficient number of additional shares of common stock available for issuance from time to time, as the occasion may arise, for future financing and acquisition transactions, to permit stock dividends or stock splits at some future date, and for other proper corporate purposes. Therefore, the Board has approved, and unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company approve the Share Increase Amendment. The proposed form of the Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation amending Article “FOURTH” of such Certificate of Incorporation is set forth in Appendix A to this proxy statement. The Articles of Amendment will have no effect on the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. \n\nCertain Risks Associated with the Share Increase Amendment \n\nThe market price of our common stock will also be based on our performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. These factors include the status of the market for our common stock, our reported results of operations in future periods, and general economic, market and industry conditions. \n\nPrincipal Effects on Outstanding Common Stock \n\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or windup of the Company, holders of common stock would be entitled to share ratably in any assets for distribution to stockholders after payment of all of the Company’s obligations, subject to the rights to receive preferential distributions of the holders of any preferred stock then outstanding. \n\nThe additional shares of common stock would have rights identical to our common stock currently outstanding. Approval of the Share Increase Amendment and any issuance of common stock would not affect the rights of the holders of our common stock currently outstanding, except to the extent that future issuances of common stock would reduce each existing stockholder’s proportionate ownership. If the proposed Share Increase Amendment is approved and the Board decides to issue such shares of common stock, such issuance of common stock would increase the outstanding number of shares of common stock, thereby causing dilution in earnings per share and voting interests of the outstanding common stock. As of March 28, 2024, 118,438,003 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and we had warrants outstanding to acquire 6,000,000 shares of our common stock. We had no other shares of our common stock subject to outstanding stock options or other convertible securities, thereby leaving 25,561,997 shares of common stock unassigned and authorized for potential issuance of the current 150,000,000 shares of common stock authorized. If the Share Increase Amendment is approved, there will be 75,561,997 shares of common stock unassigned and authorized for potential issuance. If approved, the Share Increase Amendment will not change the number of shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. \n\n44\n\nAdditionally, the issuance of additional shares of common stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. While the issuance of additional shares of common stock may be deemed to have potential anti-takeover effects, including by delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company through subsequent issuances of these shares and the other reasons set forth above, which among other things, could include issuances in one or more transactions that would make a change in control of the Company more difficult, and therefore, less likely, this proposal to increase the authorized common stock is not prompted by any specific effort of which we are aware to accumulate shares of our common stock or obtain control of the Company. A takeover may be beneficial to independent stockholders because, among other reasons, a potential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of common stock as compared to the then-existing market price. Although the issuance of additional shares of common stock could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect, this proposal to adopt the Share Increase Amendment is not in response to any attempt to accumulate common stock or obtain control of the Company that we are aware of, nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar amendments to the Board or stockholders. \n\nInterests of Certain Persons in the Proposal \n\nOur directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this Proposal 3, except to the extent of their ownership in shares of our common stock and securities convertible or exercisable for common stock. \n\nVote Required for Approval \n\nThe approval of the Shares Increase Amendment requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. \n\nBoard Recommendation \n\nThe Board recommends that the stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to \n\n200,000,000.\n\n45\n\nPROPOSAL 4 \n\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF ACCOUNTANTS \n\nRSM US LLP, independent certified public accountants, has been the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company since 2019. The Board has recommended that the stockholders ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024. \n\nA representative of RSM US LLP is expected to be present at the Meeting and will be afforded an opportunity to make a statement, if such representative desires to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. \n\nVote Required for Approval \n\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock represented in person or by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year. In the event the appointment of RSM \n\nUS LLP should not be approved by the stockholders, the Board will consider making another appointment to be effective at the earliest possible time but has no obligation to do so. Any broker non-votes and abstentions from voting received will have no effect on the outcome of this Proposal 4. \n\nBoard Recommendation \n\nThe Board recommends that the stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM as \n\nour independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024.\n\nProxies solicited by the Board will be voted “FOR” this Proposal 4. \n\nAudit Fees\n\nThe aggregate fees for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 billed by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP were as follows: \n\nFee Category| ​| ​| 2023| ​| ​| % of Total| ​| ​| 2022| ​| ​| % of Total   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAudit Fees| ​| ​| $620,124| ​| ​| 99.9%| ​| ​| $584,054 | ​| ​| 98.8%   \nAudit-Related Fees| ​| ​| 152,250| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 131,250| ​| ​| —   \nTax Fees| ​| ​| 8,453| ​| ​| 0.9| ​| ​| 8,441| ​| ​| 1.2   \nAll Other Fees| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —   \nTotal Fees| ​| ​| $780,827| ​| ​| 100%| ​| ​| $723,745| ​| ​| 100%  \n  \nAudit Fees—consists of fees for the audit of our financial statements and attestation services relating to the report on our internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports, assistance with review of documents filed with the SEC, and services that are normally provided by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, and attestation services, except those not required by statute or regulation. \n\nAudit-Related Fees—consists of fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” \n\nTax Fees—consists of fees for tax compliance and planning services. Tax compliance includes fees for professional services related to international tax compliance and preparation. Tax planning consists primarily of fees related to a transfer pricing study and preparation of our subsidiary tax returns. \n\nAll Other Fees—consists of fees for all other permissible services other than those reported above. \n\n46\n\nPolicy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm prior to the engagement with respect to such services. The Chairman of the Audit Committee has been delegated the authority by the Audit Committee to pre-approve the engagement of the independent accountants when the entire committee is unable to do so. The Audit Committee approved 100% of the services listed under the preceding captions “Audit Fees,” “Audit-Related Fees,” “Tax Fees” and “All Other Fees.” \n\n47\n\nPROPOSAL 5 \n\nADVISORY NON-BINDING VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\nIn accordance with Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the provisions of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders the opportunity to vote on a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, which is described in the section titled “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting: \n\n“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Kopin Corporation (the “Company”) approve, on an advisory basis, the overall compensation of the Company’s named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section set forth in the Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting.” \n\nAs described in the section titled “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” our executive compensation program is designed to provide a competitive level of compensation necessary to attract, motivate and retain talented and experienced executives and to motivate them to achieve short-term and long-term corporate goals that enhance stockholder value. In order to align executive pay with our financial performance and the creation of sustainable stockholder value, a significant portion of compensation paid to our named executive officers is allocated to performance-based, short- and long-term incentive programs to make executive pay dependent on our performance (or “at-risk”). In addition, as an executive officer’s responsibility and ability to affect our financial results increases, the portion of his or her total compensation deemed “at-risk” increases. Stockholders are urged to read the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy Statement, which more thoroughly discusses how our compensation policies and procedures implement our compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that these policies and procedures are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving its goals. \n\nWe provide our stockholders the opportunity every year to vote on a non-binding, advisory basis to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company expects that the next advisory vote on executive compensation will be at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. \n\nThis vote is merely advisory and will not be binding upon the Company or the Board. However, the Board values constructive dialogue on executive compensation and other important governance topics with our stockholders and encourages all stockholders to vote their shares on this matter.\n\nVote Required for Approval \n\nProposal 5 will be approved upon the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote on each such proposal. Abstentions will be counted for Proposal 5 and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will be disregarded and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote of this Proposal 5. \n\nBoard Recommendation \n\nThe Board recommends that the stockholders vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the overall compensation of the Company’s named executive officers by voting “FOR” this resolution.\n\n48\n\nCOST AND METHOD OF SOLICITATION \n\nWe will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of the Company by directors, officers or employees of the Company in person or by telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. As required by the SEC, we also will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock. \n\nGENERAL \n\nWe are not aware of any other matter other than the foregoing to be brought before the Meeting. However, the enclosed proxy gives discretionary authority to the named proxies in the event any additional matters should be presented. \n\nWe will provide free of charge to any stockholder from whom a proxy is solicited pursuant to this proxy statement, upon written request from such stockholder, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 as filed with the SEC. Our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K is enclosed. Only one copy of the Annual Report and this proxy statement and notice of annual meeting is being delivered to multiple stockholders sharing one address, unless we have received contrary instructions. Upon written or oral request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy to a stockholder at a shared address to which a copy was delivered. If you received more than one copy of the proxy statement and wish to reduce the number of reports you receive, we will discontinue the mailing of reports on the accounts you select. Requests for the foregoing should be directed to Kopin Corporation, 125 North Drive, Westborough MA 01581, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, 508-870-5959. \n\nMISCELLANEOUS \n\nYour vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we hope you will vote in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. \n\nYou may obtain a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (without exhibits) filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023, without charge upon written request to: Kopin Corporation, 125 North Drive, Westborough MA 01581, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, 508-870-5959.\n\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, we know of no matter not specifically referred to above as to which any action is expected to be taken at the Annual Meeting. The persons named as proxies will vote the proxies, insofar as they are not otherwise instructed, regarding such other matters and the transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the Annual Meeting, as they determine to be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. \n\n​| ​| James Brewington Chairman  \n---|---|---  \n  \n49\n\nAppendix A\n\nKOPIN CORPORATION \n\n2020 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN \n\nEffective as of the Effective Date (as defined below), the Kopin Corporation 2020 Incentive Equity Plan (as in effect from time to time, the “Plan”) is hereby established. \n\nThe purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of Kopin Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with its successors, the “Company”), and its subsidiaries, certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company or its subsidiaries, and non-employee members of the Board of Directors of the Company, with the opportunity to receive grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, stock units, and other stock-based awards. \n\nThe Company believes that the Plan will encourage the participants to contribute materially to the growth of the Company, thereby benefitting the Company’s stockholders, and will align the economic interests of the participants with those of the stockholders. \n\nThe Plan is a successor to the Kopin Corporation 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “Prior Plan”). No additional grants shall be made under the Prior Plan after the Effective Date. Outstanding grants under the Prior Plan shall continue in effect according to their terms, consistent with the applicable terms of the Prior Plan. \n\nSection 1. Definitions\n\nThe following terms shall have the meanings set forth below for purposes of the Plan: \n\n(a) “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company. \n\n(b) “Cause” shall have the meaning given to that term in any written employment agreement, offer letter or severance agreement between the Employer and the Participant, or if no such agreement exists or if such term is not defined therein, and unless otherwise defined in the Grant Instrument, Cause shall mean a finding by the Committee that the Participant (i) has breached his or her employment or service contract with the Employer, (ii) has engaged in disloyalty to the Employer, including, without limitation, fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony or proven dishonesty, (iii) has disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of the Employer to persons not entitled to receive such information, (iv) has breached any written non-competition, non-solicitation, invention assignment or confidentiality agreement between the Participant and the Employer or (v) has engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of the Employer as the Committee determines. \n\n(c) “CEO” shall mean the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \n\n(d) Unless otherwise set forth in a Grant Instrument, a “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if: \n\n(i) Any “person” (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes a “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company; provided that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of a transaction in which the Company becomes a direct or indirect subsidiary of another Person and in which the stockholders of the Company, immediately prior to the transaction, will beneficially own, immediately after the transaction, shares of such other Person representing more than 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding securities of such other Person. \n\n(ii) The consummation of (A) a merger or consolidation of the Company with another Person where, immediately after the merger or consolidation, the stockholders of the Company, immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, will not beneficially own, in substantially the same proportion as ownership immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, shares entitling such stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of the surviving Person would be entitled in the \n\nA-1\n\nelection of directors, or where the members of the Board, immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, will not, immediately after the merger or consolidation, constitute a majority of the board of directors of the surviving Person or (B) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. \n\n(iii) A change in the composition of the Board over a period of 12 consecutive months or less such that a majority of the Board members ceases, by reason of one or more contested elections, or threatened election contests, for Board membership, to be comprised of individuals who either (A) have been Board members continuously since the beginning of such period or (B) have been elected or nominated for election as Board members during such period by at least a majority of the Board members described in clause (A) who were still in office at the time the Board approved such election or nomination. \n\n(iv) The consummation of a complete dissolution or liquidation of the Company. \n\nThe Committee may modify the definition of Change of Control for a particular Grant as the Committee deems appropriate to comply with section 409A of the Code or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Grant constitutes deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code and the Grant provides for payment upon a Change of Control, then, for purposes of such payment provisions, no Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon an event described in items (i) – (iv) above unless the event would also constitute a change in ownership or effective control of, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company under section 409A of the Code. \n\n(e) “Code” shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. \n\n(f) “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board or another committee appointed by the Board to administer the Plan.

If interest is credited on accumulated divided equivalents, the term “Dividend Equivalent” shall include the accrued interest. \n\n(j) “Effective Date” shall mean the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 20, 2020 or such other date upon which the Company’s stockholders approve the Plan. \n\n(k) “Employee” shall mean an employee of the Employer (including an officer or director who is also an employee), but excluding any person who is classified by the Employer as a “contractor” or “consultant,” no matter how characterized by the Internal Revenue Service, other governmental agency or a court. Any change of characterization of an individual by the Internal Revenue Service or any court or government agency shall have no effect upon the classification of an individual as an Employee for purposes of this Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. \n\n(l) “Employed by, or providing service to, the Employer” shall mean employment or service as an Employee, Key Advisor or member of the Board (so that, for purposes of exercising Options and SARs and satisfying conditions with respect to Stock Awards, Stock Units, and Other Stock-Based Awards, a Participant shall not be considered to have terminated employment or service until the Participant ceases to be an Employee, Key Advisor and member of the Board), unless the Committee determines otherwise. If a Participant’s relationship is with a subsidiary of the Company and that entity ceases to be a subsidiary of the \n\nA-2\n\nCompany, the Participant will be deemed to cease employment or service when the entity ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company, unless the Participant transfers employment or service to an Employer. If a Participant has military, sick leave or other bona fide leave, the Participant will not be deemed to cease employment or service solely as a result of such leave; provided that such leave does not exceed the longer of 90 days or the period during which the absent Participant’s reemployment rights, if any, are guaranteed by statute or contract. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Committee may provide that Grants continue to vest for all or a portion of the period of such leave, or that vesting shall be tolled during such leave and only recommence upon the Participant’s return from such leave. \n\n(m) “Employer” shall mean the Company and its subsidiaries. \n\n(n) “Exchange Act” shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. \n\n(o) “Exercise Price” shall mean the per share price at which shares of Company Stock may be purchased under an Option, as designated by the Committee. \n\n(p) “Fair Market Value” shall mean: \n\n(i) If the Company Stock is publicly traded, the Fair Market Value per share shall be determined as follows: (A) if the principal trading market for the Company Stock is a national securities exchange, the closing sales price during regular trading hours on the relevant date or, if there were no trades on that date, the latest preceding date upon which a sale was reported, or (B) if the Company Stock is not principally traded on any such exchange, the last reported sale price of a share of Company Stock during regular trading hours on the relevant date, as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board. \n\n(ii) If the Company Stock is not publicly traded or, if publicly traded, is not subject to reported transactions as set forth above, the Fair Market Value per share shall be determined by the Committee through any reasonable valuation method authorized under the Code. \n\n(q) “GAAP” shall mean United States generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n(r) “Grant” shall mean an Option, SAR, Stock Award, Stock Unit or Other Stock-Based Award granted under the Plan. \n\n(s) “Grant Instrument” shall mean the written agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions of a Grant, including all amendments thereto. \n\n(t) “Incentive Stock Option” shall mean an Option that is intended to meet the requirements of an incentive stock option under section 422 of the Code. \n\n(u) “Key Advisor” shall mean a consultant or advisor of the Employer. \n\n(v) “Non-Employee Director” shall mean a member of the Board who is not an Employee. \n\n(w) “Nonqualified Stock Option” shall mean an Option that is not intended to be taxed as an incentive stock option under section 422 of the Code. \n\n(x) “Option” shall mean an option to purchase shares of Company Stock, as described in Section 6. \n\n(y) “Other Stock-Based Award” shall mean any Grant based on, measured by or payable in Company Stock (other than an Option, Stock Unit, Stock Award, or SAR), as described in Section 10. \n\n(z) “Participant” shall mean an Employee, Key Advisor or Non-Employee Director designated by the Committee to participate in the Plan. \n\n(aa) “Performance Goals” shall mean the business criteria selected by the Company to measure the level of performance of the Company or an affiliate during a performance period, which may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following criteria: cash flow;

The Committee shall have full power and express discretionary authority to administer and interpret the Plan, to make factual determinations and to adopt or amend such rules, regulations, agreements and instruments for implementing the Plan and for the conduct of its business as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion. The Committee’s interpretations of the Plan and all determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having any interest in the Plan or in any awards granted hereunder. All powers of the Committee shall be executed in its sole discretion, in the best interest of the Company, not as a fiduciary, and in keeping with the objectives of the Plan and need not be uniform as to similarly situated individuals. \n\n(e) Indemnification. No member of the Committee or the Board, and no employee of the Company shall be liable for any act or failure to act with respect to the Plan, except in circumstances involving his or her bad faith or willful misconduct, or for any act or failure to act hereunder by any other member of the Committee or employee or by any agent to whom duties in connection with the administration of this Plan have been delegated. The Company shall indemnify members of the Committee and the Board and any agent of the Committee or the Board who is an employee of the Company or a subsidiary against any and all liabilities or expenses to which they may be subjected by reason of any act or failure to act with respect to their duties on behalf of the Plan, except in circumstances involving such person’s bad faith or willful misconduct. \n\nSection 3. Grants\n\nGrants under the Plan may consist of Options as described in Section 6, Stock Awards as described in Section 7, Stock Units as described in Section 8, SARs as described in Section 9, and Other Stock-Based Awards as described in Section 10. All Grants shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and to such other terms and conditions consistent with this Plan as the Committee deems appropriate and as are specified in writing by the Committee to the individual in the Grant Instrument. All Grants shall be made conditional upon the Participant’s acknowledgement, in writing or by acceptance of the Grant, that all decisions and determinations of the Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her beneficiaries and any other person having or claiming an interest under such Grant. Grants under a particular Section of the Plan need not be uniform as among the Participants. \n\nSection 4. Shares Subject to the Plan\n\n(a) Shares Authorized. Subject to adjustment as described below in Sections 4(b) and 4(e) below, the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock that may be issued or transferred under the Plan shall be 14,000,000 shares of Company Stock. In addition, shares of the Company Stock underlying any outstanding award granted under the Prior Plan that, following the Effective Date, expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of such shares shall be available for the award of new Grants under this Plan. Subject to adjustment as described below in Sections 4(b) and 4(e) below, the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock that may be issued or transferred under the Plan pursuant to Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed 10,000,000 shares of Company Stock. \n\n(b) Source of Shares; Share Counting. Shares issued or transferred under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares of Company Stock or reacquired shares of Company Stock, including shares purchased by the Company on the open market for purposes of the Plan. If and to the extent Options or SARs granted under the Plan, expire or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without having been exercised, or if any Stock Awards, Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards are forfeited, terminated or otherwise not paid in full, the shares subject to such Grants shall again be available for purposes of the Plan. If shares of Company Stock otherwise issuable under the Plan are surrendered in payment of the Exercise Price of an Option, then the number of shares of Company Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced only by the net number of shares actually issued by the Company upon such exercise and not by the gross number of shares as to which such Option is exercised. Upon the exercise of any SAR under the Plan, the number of shares of Company Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by only by the net number of shares actually issued by the Company upon such exercise. If shares of Company Stock otherwise issuable under the Plan are withheld by the Company in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, vesting or exercise of any Grant or the issuance of Company Stock thereunder, then the number of shares of Company Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be \n\nA-5\n\nreduced by the net number of shares issued, vested or exercised under such Grant, calculated in each instance after payment of such share withholding. To the extent any Grants are paid in cash, and not in shares of Company Stock, any shares previously subject to such Grants shall again be available for issuance or transfer under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, if shares are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the Exercise Price of Options, such shares may not again be made available for issuance under the Plan. \n\n(c) Substitute Awards. Shares issued or transferred under Grants made pursuant to an assumption, substitution or exchange for previously granted awards of a company acquired by the Company in a transaction (“Substitute Awards”) shall not reduce the number of shares of Company Stock available under the Plan and available shares under a stockholder approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the transaction) may be used for Grants under the Plan and shall not reduce the Plan’s share reserve (subject to applicable stock exchange listing and Code requirements). \n\n(d) Individual Limits for Non-Employee Directors. Subject to adjustment as described below in Section 4(e), the maximum aggregate grant date value of shares of Company Stock subject to Grants granted to any Non-Employee Director during any calendar year, taken together with any cash fees earned by such Non- Employee Director for services rendered during the calendar year, shall not exceed $250,000 in total value. For purposes of this limit, the value of such Grants shall be calculated based on the grant date fair value of such Grants for financial reporting purposes. \n\n(e) Adjustments. If there is any change in the number or kind of shares of Company Stock outstanding by reason of (i) a stock dividend, spinoff, recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation, (iii) a reclassification or change in par value, or (iv) any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding Company Stock as a class without the Company’s receipt of consideration, or if the value of outstanding shares of Company Stock is substantially reduced as a result of a spinoff or the Company’s payment of an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the maximum number and kind of shares of Company Stock available for issuance under the Plan, the maximum amount of Grants which a Non-Employee Director may receive in any year, the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding Grants, the number and kind of shares issued and to be issued under the Plan, and the price per share or the applicable market value of such Grants shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of, or change in the kind or value of, the issued shares of Company Stock to preclude, to the extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under the Plan and such outstanding Grants; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control, the provisions of Section 12 of the Plan shall apply. Any adjustments to outstanding Grants shall be consistent with section 409A or 424 of the Code, to the extent applicable. The adjustments of Grants under this Section 4(e) shall include adjustment of shares, Exercise Price of Stock Options, base amount of SARs, Performance Goals or other terms and conditions, as the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee shall have the sole discretion and authority to determine what appropriate adjustments shall be made and any adjustments determined by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. \n\nSection 5. Eligibility for Participation\n\n(a) Eligible Persons. All Employees and Non-Employee Directors shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Key Advisors shall be eligible to participate in the Plan if the Key Advisors render bona fide services to the Employer, the services are not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction and the Key Advisors do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the Company’s securities. \n\n(b) Selection of Participants. The Committee shall select the Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Key Advisors to receive Grants and shall determine the number of shares of Company Stock subject to a particular Grant in such manner as the Committee determines. \n\nA-6\n\nSection 6. Options \n\nThe Committee may grant Options to an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Key Advisor upon such terms as the Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Options: \n\n(a) Number of Shares. The Committee shall determine the number of shares of Company Stock that will be subject to each Grant of Options to Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Key Advisors. \n\n(b) Type of Option and Exercise Price.\n\n(i) The Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options or any combination of the two, all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or its parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in section 424 of the Code. Nonqualified Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Non-Employee Directors and Key Advisors. \n\n(ii) The Exercise Price of Company Stock subject to an Option shall be determined by the Committee and shall be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock on the date the Option is granted. However, an Incentive Stock Option may not be granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as defined in section 424 of the Code, unless the Exercise Price per share is not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock on the date of grant. \n\n(c) Option Term. The Committee shall determine the term of each Option. The term of any Option shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. However, an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as defined in section 424 of the Code, may not have a term that exceeds five years from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option (other than an Incentive Stock Option), the exercise of the Option is prohibited by applicable law, including a prohibition on purchases or sales of Company Stock under the Company’s insider trading policy, the term of the Option shall be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, unless the Committee determines otherwise. \n\n(d) Exercisability of Options. Options shall become exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as may be determined by the Committee and specified in the Grant Instrument. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any or all outstanding Options at any time for any reason. \n\n(e) Grants to Non-Exempt Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options granted to persons who are non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, may not be exercisable for at least six months after the date of grant (except that such Options may become exercisable, as determined by the Committee, upon the Participant’s death, Disability or retirement, or upon a Change of Control or other circumstances permitted by applicable regulations). \n\n(f) Termination of Employment or Service. Except as provided in the Grant Instrument, an Option may only be exercised while the Participant is employed by, or providing services to, the Employer. The Committee shall determine in the Grant Instrument under what circumstances and during what time periods a Participant may exercise an Option after termination of employment or service. \n\n(g) Exercise of Options. A Participant may exercise an Option that has become exercisable, in whole or in part, by delivering a notice of exercise to the Company. The Participant shall pay the Exercise Price for an Option as specified by the Committee (i) in cash, (ii) unless the Committee determines otherwise, by delivering shares of Company Stock owned by the Participant and having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise at least equal to the Exercise Price or by attestation (on a form prescribed by the Committee) to ownership of shares of Company Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise at least equal to the Exercise Price, (iii) by payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) if permitted by the Committee, by withholding shares of Company Stock subject to the exercisable Option, which have a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise \n\nA-7\n\nequal to the Exercise Price, or (v) by such other method as the Committee may approve. Shares of Company Stock used to exercise an Option shall have been held by the Participant for the requisite period of time necessary to avoid adverse accounting consequences to the Company with respect to the Option. Payment for the shares to be issued or transferred pursuant to the Option, and any required withholding taxes, must be received by the Company by the time specified by the Committee depending on the type of payment being made, but in all cases prior to the issuance or transfer of such shares. \n\n(h) Limits on Incentive Stock Options. Each Incentive Stock Option shall provide that, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Company Stock on the date of the grant with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year, under the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Company or a parent or subsidiary, exceeds $100,000, then the Option, as to the excess, shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. \n\nSection 7. Stock Awards\n\nThe Committee may issue or transfer shares of Company Stock to an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Key Advisor under a Stock Award, upon such terms as the Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Stock Awards: \n\n(a) General Requirements. Shares of Company Stock issued or transferred pursuant to Stock Awards may be issued or transferred for consideration or for no consideration, and subject to restrictions or no restrictions, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may, but shall not be required to, establish conditions under which restrictions on Stock Awards shall lapse over a period of time or according to such other criteria as the Committee deems appropriate, including, without limitation, restrictions based on the achievement of specific Performance Goals. The period of time during which the Stock Awards will remain subject to restrictions will be designated in the Grant Instrument as the “Restriction Period.”\n\n(b) Number of Shares. The Committee shall determine the number of shares of Company Stock to be issued or transferred pursuant to a Stock Award and the restrictions applicable to such shares. \n\n(c) Requirement of Employment or Service. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer during a period designated in the Grant Instrument as the Restriction Period, or if other specified conditions are not met, the Stock Award shall terminate as to all shares covered by the Grant as to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and those shares of Company Stock must be immediately returned to the Company. The Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement as it deems appropriate. \n\n(d) Restrictions on Transfer and Legend on Stock Certificate. During the Restriction Period, a Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the shares of a Stock Award except under Section 15 below. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Company will retain possession of certificates for shares of Stock Awards until all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. Each certificate for a Stock Award, unless held by the Company, shall contain a legend giving appropriate notice of the restrictions in the Grant. The Participant shall be entitled to have the legend removed from the stock certificate covering the shares subject to restrictions when all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. The Committee may determine that the Company will not issue certificates for Stock Awards until all restrictions on such shares have lapsed. \n\n(e) Right to Vote and to Receive Dividends. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, during the Restriction Period, the Participant shall have the right to vote shares of Stock Awards and to receive any dividends or other distributions paid on such shares, subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee, including, without limitation, the achievement of specific Performance Goals. Dividends with respect to Stock Awards that vest based on performance shall vest if and to the extent that the underlying Stock Award vests, as determined by the Committee. \n\n(f) Lapse of Restrictions. All restrictions imposed on Stock Awards shall lapse upon the expiration of the applicable Restriction Period and the satisfaction of all conditions, if any, imposed by the Committee. The Committee may determine, as to any or all Stock Awards, that the restrictions shall lapse without regard to any Restriction Period. \n\nA-8\n\nSection 8. Stock Units\n\nThe Committee may grant Stock Units, each of which shall represent one hypothetical share of Company Stock, to an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Key Advisor upon such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Stock Units: \n\n(a) Crediting of Units. Each Stock Unit shall represent the right of the Participant to receive a share of Company Stock or an amount of cash based on the value of a share of Company Stock, if and when specified conditions are met. All Stock Units shall be credited to bookkeeping accounts established on the Company’s records for purposes of the Plan. \n\n(b) Terms of Stock Units. The Committee may grant Stock Units that vest and are payable if specified Performance Goals or other conditions are met, or under other circumstances. Stock Units may be paid at the end of a specified performance period or other period, or payment may be deferred to a date authorized by the Committee. The Committee may accelerate vesting or payment, as to any or all Stock Units at any time for any reason, provided such acceleration complies with section 409A of the Code. The Committee shall determine the number of Stock Units to be granted and the requirements applicable to such Stock Units. \n\n(c) Requirement of Employment or Service. If the Participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Employer prior to the vesting of Stock Units, or if other conditions established by the Committee are not met, the Participant’s Stock Units shall be forfeited. The Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement as it deems appropriate. \n\n(d) Payment With Respect to Stock Units. Payments with respect to Stock Units shall be made in cash, Company Stock or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee shall determine. \n\nSection 9. Stock Appreciation Rights\n\nThe Committee may grant SARs to an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Key Advisor separately or in tandem with any Option. The following provisions are applicable to SARs: \n\n(a) General Requirements. The Committee may grant SARs to an Employee, Non-Employee Director or Key Advisor separately or in tandem with any Option (for all or a portion of the applicable Option). Tandem SARs may be granted either at the time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter while the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, SARs may be granted only at the time of the grant of the Incentive Stock Option. The Committee shall establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted. The base amount of each SAR shall be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock as of the date of grant of the SAR. The term of any SAR shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that on the last business day of the term of a SAR, the exercise of the SAR is prohibited by applicable law, including a prohibition on purchases or sales of Company Stock under the Company’s insider trading policy, the term shall be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, unless the Committee determines otherwise. \n\n(b) Tandem SARs. In the case of tandem SARs, the number of SARs granted to a Participant that shall be exercisable during a specified period shall not exceed the number of shares of Company Stock that the Participant may purchase upon the exercise of the related Option during such period. Upon the exercise of an Option, the SARs relating to the Company Stock covered by such Option shall terminate. Upon the exercise of SARs, the related Option shall terminate to the extent of an equal number of shares of Company Stock. \n\n(c) Exercisability. A SAR shall be exercisable during the period specified by the Committee in the Grant Instrument and shall be subject to such vesting and other restrictions as may be specified in the Grant Instrument. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any or all outstanding SARs at any time for any reason. SARs may only be exercised while the Participant is employed by, or providing service to, the Employer or during the applicable period after termination of employment or service as specified by the Committee. A tandem SAR shall be exercisable only during the period when the Option to which it is related is also exercisable. \n\nA-9\n\n(d) Grants to Non-Exempt Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SARs granted to persons who are non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, may not be exercisable for at least six months after the date of grant (except that such SARs may become exercisable, as determined by the Committee, upon the Participant’s death, Disability or retirement, or upon a Change of Control or other circumstances permitted by applicable regulations). \n\n(e) Value of SARs. When a Participant exercises SARs, the Participant shall receive in settlement of such SARs an amount equal to the value of the stock appreciation for the number of SARs exercised. The stock appreciation for a SAR is the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the underlying Company Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR exceeds the base amount of the SAR as described in subsection (a). \n\n(f) Form of Payment. The appreciation in a SAR shall be paid in shares of Company Stock, cash or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee shall determine. For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Company Stock to be received, shares of Company Stock shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. \n\nSection 10. Other Stock-Based Awards\n\nThe Committee may grant Other Stock-Based Awards, which are awards (other than those described in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Plan) that are based on or measured by Company Stock, to any Employee, Non- Employee Director or Key Advisor, on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Other Stock-Based Awards may be awarded subject to the achievement of Performance Goals or other criteria or other conditions and may be payable in cash, Company Stock or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee shall determine. \n\nSection 11. Dividend Equivalents\n\nThe Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents in connection with Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards. Dividend Equivalents may be paid currently or accrued as contingent cash obligations and may be payable in cash or shares of Company Stock, and upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Dividend Equivalents with respect to Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards that vest based on performance shall vest and be paid only if and to the extent the underlying Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards vest and are paid, as determined by the Committee. \n\nSection 12. Consequences of a Change of Control\n\n(a) Assumption of Outstanding Grants. Upon a Change of Control where the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding Grants that are not exercised or paid at the time of the Change of Control shall be assumed by, or replaced with grants (with respect to cash, securities, or a combination thereof) that have comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). After a Change of Control, references to the “Company” as they relate to employment matters shall include the successor employer in the transaction, subject to applicable law. \n\n(b) Vesting Upon Certain Terminations of Employment. Unless the Grant Instrument provides otherwise, if a Participant’s employment is terminated by the Employer without Cause upon or within 12 months following a Change of Control, the Participant’s outstanding Grants shall become fully vested as of the date of such termination; provided that if the vesting of any such Grants is based, in whole or in part, on performance, the applicable Grant Instrument shall specify how the portion of the Grant that becomes vested pursuant to this Section 12(b) shall be calculated. \n\n(c) Other Alternatives. In the event of a Change of Control, if any outstanding Grants are not assumed by, or replaced with grants that have comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), the Committee may (but is not obligated to) make adjustments to the terms and conditions of outstanding Grants, including, without limitation, taking any of the following actions (or combination thereof) with respect to any or all outstanding Grants, without the consent of any Participant: (i) the Committee may determine that outstanding Stock Options and SARs shall automatically accelerate and become fully exercisable and the restrictions and conditions on outstanding Stock Awards, Stock Units and Dividend Equivalents shall immediately lapse; (ii) the Committee may determine that \n\nA-10\n\nParticipants shall receive a payment in settlement of outstanding Stock Units or Dividend Equivalents, in such amount and form as may be determined by the Committee; (iii) the Committee may require that Participants surrender their outstanding Stock Options and SARs in exchange for a payment by the Company, in cash or Company Stock as determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Participant’s unexercised Stock Options and SARs exceeds the Stock Option Exercise Price or SAR base amount, and (iv) after giving Participants an opportunity to exercise all of their outstanding Stock Options and SARs, the Committee may terminate any or all unexercised Stock Options and SARs at such time as the Committee deems appropriate. Such surrender, termination or payment shall take place as of the date of the Change of Control or such other date as the Committee may specify. Without limiting the foregoing, if the per share Fair Market Value of the Company Stock does not exceed the per share Stock Option Exercise Price or SAR base amount, as applicable, the Company shall not be required to make any payment to the Participant upon surrender of the Stock Option or SAR. \n\nSection 13. Deferrals\n\nThe Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant in connection with any Grant. If any such deferral election is permitted or required, the Committee shall establish rules and procedures for such deferrals and may provide for interest or other earnings to be paid on such deferrals. The rules and procedures for any such deferrals shall be consistent with applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code. \n\nSection 14. Withholding of Taxes\n\n(a) Required Withholding. All Grants under the Plan shall be subject to applicable United States federal (including FICA), state and local, foreign country or other tax withholding requirements. The Employer may require that the Participant or other person receiving Grants or exercising Grants pay to the Employer an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax withholding requirements with respect to such Grants, or the Employer may deduct from other wages and compensation paid by the Employer the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such Grants. \n\n(b) Share Withholding. The Committee may permit or require the Employer’s tax withholding obligation with respect to Grants paid in Company Stock to be satisfied by having shares withheld up to an amount that does not exceed the Participant’s applicable withholding tax rate for United States federal (including FICA), state and local, foreign country or other tax liabilities. The Committee may, in its discretion, and subject to such rules as the Committee may adopt, allow Participants to elect to have such share withholding applied to all or a portion of the tax withholding obligation arising in connection with any particular Grant. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, share withholding for taxes shall not exceed the Participant’s minimum applicable tax withholding amount. \n\nSection 15. Transferability of Grants\n\n(a) Nontransferability of Grants. Except as described in subsection (b) below, only the Participant may exercise rights under a Grant during the Participant’s lifetime. A Participant may not transfer those rights except (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (ii) with respect to Grants other than Incentive Stock Options, pursuant to a domestic relations order. When a Participant dies, the personal representative or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the Participant may exercise such rights. Any such successor must furnish proof satisfactory to the Company of his or her right to receive the Grant under the Participant’s will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. \n\n(b) Transfer of Nonqualified Stock Options and Stock Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide, in a Grant Instrument or at such other time after the grant of an award, that a Participant may transfer Nonqualified Stock Options or Stock Awards to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members, consistent with the applicable securities laws, according to such terms as the Committee may determine; provided that the Participant receives no consideration for the transfer of an Option or Stock Award and the transferred Option or Stock Award shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option or Stock Award immediately before the transfer. \n\nA-11\n\nSection 16. Requirements for Issuance or Transfer of Shares\n\nNo Company Stock shall be issued or transferred in connection with any Grant hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the issuance or transfer of such Company Stock have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to condition any Grant on the Participant’s undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on his or her subsequent disposition of the shares of Company Stock as the Committee shall deem necessary or advisable, and certificates representing such shares may be legended to reflect any such restrictions. Certificates representing shares of Company Stock issued or transferred under the Plan may be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations and interpretations, including any requirement that a legend be placed thereon. \n\nSection 17. Amendment and Termination of the Plan\n\n(a) Amendment. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that the Board shall not amend the Plan without stockholder approval if such approval is required in order to comply with the Code or other applicable law, or to comply with applicable stock exchange requirements. \n\n(b) No Repricing of Options or SARs. Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, distribution (whether in the form of cash, Company Stock, other securities or property), stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, change in control, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of Company Stock or other securities, or similar transactions), the Company may not, without obtaining stockholder approval, (i) amend the terms of outstanding Stock Options or SARs to reduce the Exercise Price of such outstanding Stock Options or base price of such SARs, (ii) cancel outstanding Stock Options or SARs in exchange for Stock Options or SARs with an Exercise Price or base price, as applicable, that is less than the Exercise Price or base price of the original Stock Options or SARs or (iii) cancel outstanding Stock Options or SARs with an Exercise Price or base price, as applicable, above the current stock price in exchange for cash or other securities. \n\n(c) Termination of Plan. The Plan shall terminate on the day immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of its Effective Date, unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders. \n\n(d) Termination and Amendment of Outstanding Grants. A termination or amendment of the Plan that occurs after a Grant is made shall not materially impair the rights of a Participant with respect to such Grant unless the Participant consents or unless the Committee acts under Section 18(f) below. The termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Committee with respect to an outstanding Grant. Whether or not the Plan has terminated, an outstanding Grant may be terminated or amended under Section 18(f) below or may be amended by agreement of the Company and the Participant consistent with the Plan. \n\nSection 18. Miscellaneous\n\n(a) Grants in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to (i) limit the right of the Committee to make Grants under the Plan in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants to employees thereof who become Employees, or (ii) limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or make other awards outside of the Plan. The Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another corporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the Company, in substitution for a stock option or stock awards grant made by such corporation. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may establish such terms and conditions of the new Grants as it deems appropriate, including setting the Exercise Price of Options or the base price of SARs at a price necessary to retain for the Participant the same economic value as the prior options or rights. \n\n(b) Governing Document. The Plan shall be the controlling document. No other statements, representations, explanatory materials or examples, oral or written, may amend the Plan in any manner. The Plan shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Company and its successors and assigns. \n\nA-12\n\n(c) Funding of the Plan. The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any Grants under the Plan. \n\n(d) Rights of Participants. Nothing in the Plan shall entitle any Employee, Non-Employee Director, Key Advisor or other person to any claim or right to receive a Grant under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any individual any rights to be retained by or in the employ of the Employer or any other employment rights. \n\n(e) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Company Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Grant. Except as otherwise provided under the Plan, the Committee shall determine whether cash, other awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. \n\n(f) Compliance with Law.\n\n(i) The Plan, the exercise of Options and SARs and the obligations of the Company to issue or transfer shares of Company Stock under Grants shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations, and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. With respect to persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In addition, it is the intent of the Company that Incentive Stock Options comply with the applicable provisions of section 422 of the Code, and that, to the extent applicable, Grants comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any legal requirement of section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422 or 409A of the Code as set forth in the Plan ceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422 or 409A of the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply. The Committee may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation. The Committee may also adopt rules regarding the withholding of taxes on payments to Participants. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, agree to limit its authority under this Section. \n\n(ii) The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. Each Grant shall be construed and administered such that the Grant either (A) qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of section 409A of the Code or (B) satisfies the requirements of section 409A of the Code. If a Grant is subject to section 409A of the Code, (I) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under section 409A of the Code, (II) payments to be made upon a termination of employment or service shall only be made upon a “separation from service” under section 409A of the Code, (III) unless the Grant specifies otherwise, each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of section 409A of the Code, and (IV) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with section 409A of the Code. \n\n(iii) Any Grant that is subject to section 409A of the Code and that is to be distributed to a Key Employee (as defined below) upon separation from service shall be administered so that any distribution with respect to such Grant shall be postponed for six months following the date of the Participant’s separation from service, if required by section 409A of the Code. If a distribution is delayed pursuant to section 409A of the Code, the distribution shall be paid within 15 days after the end of the six-month period. If the Participant dies during such six-month period, any postponed amounts shall be paid within 90 days of the Participant’s death. The determination of Key Employees, including the number and identity of persons considered Key Employees and the identification date, shall be made by the Committee or its delegate each year in accordance with section 416(i) of the Code and the “specified employee” requirements of section 409A of the Code. \n\n(iv) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Grant agreement to the contrary, each Participant shall be solely responsible for the tax consequences of Grants under the Plan, and in no event shall the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company have any responsibility or \n\nA-13\n\nliability if a Grant does not meet any applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan to prevent taxation under section 409A of the Code, the Company does not represent or warrant that the Plan or any Grant complies with any provision of federal, state, local or other tax law. \n\n(g) Grants in Foreign Countries; Establishment of Subplans. The Committee has the authority to award Grants to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States on any different terms and conditions than those specified in the Plan that the Committee, in its discretion, believes to be necessary or desirable to accommodate differences in applicable law, tax policy, or custom, while furthering the purposes of the Plan. The Board may from time to time establish one or more sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable blue sky, securities or tax laws of various jurisdictions. The Board shall establish such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the Plan setting forth (i) such limitations on the Committee’s discretion under the Plan as the Board deems necessary or desirable and (ii) such additional terms and conditions not otherwise inconsistent with the Plan as the Board shall deem necessary or desirable. All supplements adopted by the Board shall be deemed to be part of the Plan, but each supplement shall apply only to Participants within the affected jurisdiction and the Employer shall not be required to provide copies of any supplement to Participants in any jurisdiction that is not affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not approve any sub-plan inconsistent with the terms or share limits in the Plan or which would otherwise cause the Plan to cease to satisfy any conditions under Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act. \n\n(h) Clawback Rights. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Committee may provide in any Grant Instrument that, if a Participant breaches any restrictive covenant agreement between the Participant and the Employer (which may be set forth in any Grant Instrument) or otherwise engages in activities that constitute Cause either while employed by, or providing service to, the Employer or within a specified period of time thereafter, all Grants held by the Participant shall terminate, and the Company may rescind any exercise of an Option or SAR and the vesting of any other Grant and delivery of shares upon such exercise or vesting (including pursuant to dividends and Dividend Equivalents), as applicable on such terms as the Committee shall determine, including the right to require that in the event of any such rescission, (i) the Participant shall return to the Company the shares received upon the exercise of any Option or SAR and/or the vesting and payment of any other Grant (including pursuant to dividends and Dividend Equivalents) or, (ii) if the Participant no longer owns the shares, the Participant shall pay to the Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of any sale or other disposition of the shares (or, in the event the Participant transfers the shares by gift or otherwise without consideration, the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of the breach of the restrictive covenant agreement (including a Participant’s Grant Instrument containing restrictive covenants) or activity constituting Cause), net of the price originally paid by the Participant for the shares. Payment by the Participant shall be made in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required by the Committee. The Employer shall be entitled to set off against the amount of any such payment any amounts otherwise owed to the Participant by the Employer. In addition, all Grants under the Plan shall be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time. \n\n(i) Governing Law; Jurisdiction. The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of the Plan and Grant Instrument issued under the Plan shall be governed and construed by and determined in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any action arising out of, or relating to, any of the provisions of the Plan and Grants made hereunder shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Massachusetts, and the jurisdiction of such court in any such proceeding shall be exclusive. \n\nA-14\n\nAppendix B \n\nCERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT\n\nOF\n\nCERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\n\nOF\n\nKOPIN CORPORATION \n\nPursuant to Section 242 of the\n\nGeneral Corporation Law of the State of Delaware \n\nKOPIN CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, \n\nDOES HEREBY CERTIFY: \n\nFIRST: That the Board of Directors of said corporation, at a meeting of its members duly called and held pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, duly adopted a resolution proposing and declaring advisable the following amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of said corporation. \n\nRESOLVED, That the first sentence of Article Fourth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation be and it hereby is amended to read as follows: \n\n“FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is one hundred fifty million and three thousand (200,003,000) shares, of which three thousand (3,000) shares, par value of $.01 each, are to be of a class designated Preferred Stock, and two hundred million (200,000,000) shares, par value of $.01 each, are to be of a class designated Common Stock.” \n\nSECOND: That thereafter, pursuant to resolution of its Board of Directors, an annual meeting of the stockholders of said corporation was duly called and held, upon notice in accordance with Section 222 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware at which meeting the necessary number of shares as required by statute were voted in favor of the amendment. \n\nTHIRD: That the aforesaid amendment was duly adopted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. \n\nFOURTH: That this Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State, which will occur as soon as reasonably practicable after approval. \n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, said Kopin Corporation has caused this Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to be executed, acknowledged and filed by its Chief Financial Officer this [•] day of June 2024. \n\n​| ​| KOPIN CORPORATION   \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| By:| ​| ​| /s/ Richard A.

Such factors may be in addition to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors;” Part II, Item 7. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” and other parts of this Form 10-K. These factors include: our ability to source semiconductor components and other raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products amidst continued intermittent shortages, including from new and alternative suppliers; our ability to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively or successfully; our ability to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business; our ability to invest in research and development to achieve profitability even during periods when we are not profitable; any disruptions or delays in our supply chains, particularly with respect to semiconductor components, whether resulting from regional or global geopolitical developments or otherwise; costs and outcomes relating to any disputes, governmental inquiries or investigations, regulatory proceedings, legal proceedings or litigation; our ability to continue to introduce new products in our target markets; our ability to generate revenue growth and positive cash flow, and reach profitability; the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its effects on the price of our products in foreign markets; the impact of new regulations and customer demands relating to conflict minerals; our ability to obtain a competitive advantage in the wearable technologies market through our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how; our ability to grow within our targeted markets; the importance of small form factor displays in the development of defense, consumer, and industrial products such as thermal weapon sights, safety equipment, virtual and augmented reality gaming, training and simulation products and metrology tools; the suitability of our properties for our needs for the foreseeable future; and our need to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability._\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1.** | **_Business_**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Overview**\n\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1984, Kopin Corporation (\"Kopin” or \"the Company”) is a leading developer and provider of high-performance application-specific optical solutions consisting of high-resolution microdisplays and optics, subassemblies, and headsets. We define microdisplays as displays that have a diagonal measurement of less than 2 inches. Our products are used for defense applications (thermal weapon rifle sights, fixed and rotary wing pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training & simulation headsets); industrial and medical headsets; and 3D optical inspection systems. We believe that the technologies we are developing may eventually be used in consumer augmented reality (\"AR”) and virtual reality (\"VR”) wearable headset systems. Our products are primarily used to overlay digital information on the real-world scene.\n\nAs part of our plan to focus our resources on new and existing defense, industrial and consumer applications that are in line with our strategic plan, in January 2023, we conducted a partial spinout of our organic light emitting diode (\"OLED”) development unit to Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (\"Lightning Silicon”). Lightning Silicon received a license under a Technology License agreement to certain Kopin intellectual property to develop, manufacture and sell OLED display technologies for use in the consumer market, based on 12 inch deposition technology development. The Technology License agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to Lightning Silicon if they achieve certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. We received an equity interest in Lightning Silicon and expect to receive royalties from the sale of products related to the licenses. We retained the ability and rights to develop, manufacture and sell OLED displays and complete optical solutions that include microdisplays to our core base in the defense and enterprise markets, as well as value added consumer applications. Lightning Silicon is a company formed by Dr. John C.C. Fan, our former Chairman of the Board, and former Chief Executive Officer, to develop and supply advanced OLED microdisplays for the consumer augmented reality and virtual reality markets.\n\nWe are transitioning from selling just displays to a solution that includes our display, optics, and drive electronics in a subassembly or a headset for the customer’s particular application. Our strategy is to focus on providing our defense, industrial and medical customers with application-specific optical solutions, which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. Our application-specific optical solutions are based on our proprietary microdisplay technologies, which include micro inorganic light emitting diode (\"MicroLED”), OLED, liquid crystal on silicon (\"LCOS”), and active-matrix liquid crystal displays (\"AMLCDs”) and various optics which may be our proprietary designs.\n\nOur primary sources of product revenues are from the sale of display and optical components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and development contracts primarily for U.S. defense programs. We believe we also are well-positioned with our technology, intellectual property, manufacturing capabilities and partnerships and reputation to take advantage of the emerging market for AR and VR applications and products of which microdisplays are the cornerstone technology. At the center of all our products is a microdisplay. We are the only company, to our knowledge, that offers AMLCDs, LCOS displays and OLED displays, and related optics, which enable us to serve the markets and customers based on their needs and the problems they are trying to solve. We are also in development to create MicroLED displays and displays with additional capabilities such as eye-tracking. We believe our display technologies, combined with our extensive expertise in optics, system electronics and human factors, are the reason why many customers come to us. In situations where a new market is developing, or the market already has a number of low-priced display offerings of the size and resolution needed, we may purchase displays from other display companies for use with our proprietary optics and or headset designs.\n\nThe components we offer for sale consist of our proprietary miniature or micro AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED display technologies, application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs”), backlights, and optical lenses. We refer to our AMLCD as \"CyberDisplay®,” our LCOS displays/Spatial Light Modulators (\"SLMs”) as \"Time Domain Imaging TM technology”, and our OLED displays as \"Lightning® displays”. Our transmissive AMLCDs are designed in Westborough, Massachusetts, have initial manufacturing steps performed in Taiwan and then are completed in our facility in Westborough, Massachusetts.\n\nOur AMLCD and OLED displays are sold separately or in subassemblies. For example, we offer a display as a single product, a display module which includes a display, an optical lens and backlight contained in either plastic or metal housings, a binocular display module which has two displays, lenses and backlights, and a higher-level assembly which has additional components for defense applications. Examples of products manufactured by our customers that include our AMLCD and OLED displays include:\n\n● | Weapon sights and target locators for soldiers to enable faster and more accurate target acquisition;  \n---|---  \n● | Weapon sight systems that support artificial intelligence (\"AI”) based targeting systems in tanks;  \n● | Fighter and helicopter pilot helmets that use our display to overlay information (targeting, flight operation, etc.);  \n● | Headsets and systems used by soldiers for training and simulation purposes;  \n● | Industrial headsets for applications such as field maintenance/service where a service worker can visually access diagrams and drawings in real time while keeping both hands free to conduct work or to access a remote expert with live video to help solve a problem remotely – thereby increasing productivity and effectiveness;  \n● | Medical headsets used by surgeons that include our displays so that the surgeon simply glances down to see the patient or glances up and sees a magnified image of the anatomy being worked on; and  \n● | AR consumer products for recreational use including rifle sights.  \n  \nOur LCOS products are designed and manufactured at our Forth Dimension Displays (\"FDD”) subsidiary in Dalgety Bay, Scotland. Our LCOS displays are often configured with drive electronics and sold as a package that makes it easier for our customers to design our displays into their end products. A significant portion of the LCOS displays are sold to customers for incorporation into SLMs, which are built into manufacturing equipment that are used for 3D optical measurement.\n\nWe are currently developing color and monochrome MicroLED displays and displays with additional capabilities.\n\nThe AMLCD display driver ASICs we offer are the electronic interfaces between our displays and the products into which the displays are incorporated. The optical lenses and backlights we offer are based on either our proprietary designs or designs we license from third parties. The ASICs, optical lenses, and backlights are manufactured by third parties.\n\nWe design and manufacture defense and industrial head-mounted and hand-held VR products for training and simulation. Our products allow customers to visualize and interact with simulated 3D environments and equipment for training purposes. Our customers develop high-fidelity training and simulation applications that require high-performance visuals, intuitive controls, and unsurpassed customer support.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nThe focus of our internally funded research and development activities is on our OLED, MicroLED and other display technologies. Previously we used internally funded research and development funds to design headset systems that were focused on the emerging industrial and consumer markets for head-worn, hands-free, voice-and gesture-controlled wireless computing and communication devices. We continue to license our previously designed systems under agreements that may include a royalty payable to us and a purchase and supply agreement that requires us to supply our customers and our customers to buy our components for integration into their products. The licenses may convey the right of exclusivity for a particular market or geographic area.\n\nIn addition to sales of our components, subassemblies, and headsets, we also derive a significant portion of our revenue from developing custom product solutions for our customers, which we refer to as Funded Research and Development. We enter into development agreements with the goal of successfully developing a customer product and then winning the production orders for such products once design is complete and tested. These development programs can take several years. The Funded Research and Development process typically adds to Kopin’s knowledge base and expertise, putting us in a better position for future business. The Funded Research and Development arrangements typically have various milestones we are required to achieve to be reimbursed for our efforts. These arrangements are normally fixed price and may be cancelled by the customer on short notice. We also believe that the technologies developed for the U.S. defense industry can eventually be used in commercial and enterprise applications and subsequently in consumer applications.\n\nSales to significant non-affiliated customers for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, as a percentage of total revenues, were as follows:\n\nSales as a Percent of Total Revenue  \n---  \nFiscal Year  \n2023 | **2022** | **2021**  \nCustomer  \nDefense Customers in Total | 56| % | 52| % | 40| %  \nDRS Network & Imaging Systems, LLC | 33| % | 40| % | 31| %  \nCollins Aerospace | 27| % | 28| % | 30| %  \nFunded Research and Development Contracts | 33| % | 30| % | 32| %  \n  \nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, are referred to herein as fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n**Augmented and Virtual Reality**\n\nWe believe that defense, industrial, and consumer companies are looking at AR and VR as new applications and computing platforms. For these markets to develop and grow, advances and investment in display technology, optics, application software, and wireless communications systems with greater bandwidth such as 5G networks will be necessary. These advances in display technologies must increase performance but at the same time the cost of displays must decrease.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**Our Solution**\n\n_Kopin Technology_\n\nKopin technology includes the ability to design, and in most cases, manufacture proprietary small form factor AMLCD, LCOS, OLED and MicroLED displays and optical lenses and the know-how to design and manufacture subassemblies and headsets based on our display technologies. We also offer proprietary backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. Our displays and optics are used in defense applications (thermal weapon rifle sights, pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training and simulation headsets), industrial applications (headsets for field service personnel), medical applications (surgeon’s headsets), or consumer applications (recreational rifle scopes). We also offer backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. The subassemblies we offer combine one or two of our displays, backlight, ASIC, complex optics, and other electronics in an assembly that is then included in a larger system (for example a weapon sight or a targeting system in an armored vehicle). These subassemblies must survive the shock and vibration of weapons fire and operate in extreme environmental conditions. The headsets we offer combine two of our displays, backlight, ASIC, complex optics, and other electronics in an assembly that is a stand-alone product that must interface with a larger system. The considerable know-how that goes into the design, materials selection, assembly, and testing of these subassemblies and headsets is an important part of our technology.\n\n_Display Products_\n\nSmall form factor displays used in near-eye applications are widely used in defense in many applications such as thermal weapon sights, avionic helmets and training and simulation systems. Small form factor near-eye displays currently have more limited use in industrial products such as wearable headsets that allow users to view data, schematics, and videos to enable them to perform production or repairs. In addition, we believe small form factor near-eye displays are well suited for AR and VR consumer markets and will be a critical component in the development of these markets, which we believe will grow in the coming years. We believe our small form factor displays have certain advantages with respect to small size, resolution, brightness, and low power consumption that are advantageous for product design and usage.\n\nThere are several microdisplay technologies commercially available including transmissive, reflective, and emissive. Our principal display products are miniature high-density color or monochrome AMLCDs that range from approximately 428 x 240 resolution to 2048 x 2048 (\"2K”) resolution and are sold in either a transmissive or reflective format. We offer emissive OLED displays with a resolution of 1280 x 720 (\"720p”), 2048 x 2048 2K, 1280 x 960 (\"QVGA”) and have demonstrated a 2560 x 2560 (\"2.6K”). We are developing emissive Light Emitting Diode (\"LED”) displays. We sell our displays individually or in combination with our other components assembled in a subassembly. For example, we offer a display as a product, an industrial subassembly unit that includes one or two displays, backlight and optics in a plastic housing, and a subassembly for defense applications that we refer to as an HLA (\"Higher-Level Assembly”) that contains a display, light emitting diode-based illumination, optics, and electronics in a sealed housing. The defense subassembly or HLA is designed specifically for the repetitive shock experienced in extreme environments and use.\n\nOur transmissive AMLCD products, which we refer to as CyberDisplay® products, utilize high-quality, single-crystal-on-silicon, which is the same high-quality silicon used in conventional integrated circuits. This single-crystal-on-silicon is not grown on glass; rather, it is first formed on a silicon wafer and patterned into an integrated circuit (including the active matrix, driver circuitry and other logic circuits) at an integrated circuit foundry. These processes enable the manufacture of miniature active-matrix circuits that are comparable to higher resolution displays relative to passive and other active matrix displays that are fabricated on glass. Our foundry partners fabricate integrated circuits using our proprietary backplane designs for our displays in their foundries in Taiwan. The fabricated wafers are then returned to our facilities, where we lift the integrated circuits off the silicon wafers and transfer them to glass using our proprietary Wafer Engineering technology. The transferred integrated circuits are then processed, packaged with liquid crystal, and assembled into display panels at our Westborough, Massachusetts facility. When combined with the appropriate optic, the display provides the user with a high-resolution, full-screen experience.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nOur proprietary technology enables the production of transparent circuits on a transparent substrate, in contrast to conventional silicon circuits, which are on an opaque substrate. Our CyberDisplay products’ imaging properties are a result of the inclusion of a liquid crystal layer between the active-matrix integrated circuit glass and the transparent cover glass. We believe our manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional active-matrix LCD manufacturing approaches, including:\n\n● | Greater miniaturization;  \n---|---  \n● | Higher pixel density;  \n● | Lower power consumption; and  \n● | Higher brightness.  \n  \nThe color CyberDisplay products generate colors by using color filters with a white backlight. Color filter technology is a process in which display pixels are patterned with materials, which selectively absorb or transmit the red, green, or blue colors of light.\n\nOur reflective LCOS display products are miniature high-density, dual mode color sequential/monochrome reflective microdisplays with resolutions that range from approximately 1280 x 768 pixels (\"WXGA”) resolution to 2K resolution. These displays are manufactured by our FDD subsidiary in Scotland. Our reflective displays are based on a proprietary, high-speed, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon (\"FLCOS”) platform. Our digital software and logic-based drive electronics combined with the very fast switching binary liquid crystal, enables our microdisplays to process images purely digitally and create red, green, and blue gray scale in the time domain. This architecture has major advantages in visual performance over other liquid crystal, organic light-emitting diode, and microelectromechanical systems-based technologies: precisely controlled full color or monochrome gray scale is achieved on a matrix of undivided high fill factor pixels, motion artifacts are reduced to an insignificant level, and there are no sub-pixels, no moving mirrors, and no analog conversions to detract from the quality of the image.\n\nThe FLCOS device is comprised of two substrates. The first is a pixelated silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (\"CMOS”) substrate which is manufactured by our foundry partner based on our proprietary backplane design using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. The silicon substrate forms the display’s backplane, serving as both the active matrix to drive individual pixels and as a reflective mirror. The second substrate is a front glass plate. Between the backplane and the front glass substrate is a ferroelectric liquid crystal material which, when switched, enables the incoming illumination to be modulated.\n\nOur OLED technology can emit light when electrical current flows through its electroluminescent layers as opposed to our AMLCD which requires a separate light source. Our OLED microdisplays have a top-emitting structure built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than on glass. An OLED display typically has a wider viewing angle than an AMLCD. Light from an OLED appears evenly distributed in the forward directions, and so a slight movement of the eye relative to the display does not perceive the change in the image brightness or color. OLED displays can also have a much higher contrast ratio than AMLCDs, which is desirable for some user applications.\n\nWe aim to disrupt the OLED microdisplays industry with a new fabless, scalable business model. We believe the partitioning of OLED manufacturing into multiple parties, each focusing on their core competencies, can make a significant difference in OLED microdisplays performance and supply chain, while reducing the capital cost and overhead costs of entering this business. Making OLED microdisplays involves three major steps: designing backplane circuits, processing silicon wafers to generate backplane wafers, and deposition of OLED layers on silicon backplane wafers and packaging the displays. We believe backplane design is the most intellectual property-intensive area. Kopin has more than 20 patents granted or pending on the design of OLED backplanes to get low power consumption, high frame rates, and more uniform display images. Kopin has established relationships with two silicon foundries to produce OLED backplane wafers. We believe Kopin’s Lightning® backplane technology and the emergence of high-volume OLED manufacturing facilities can reduce the cost of manufacturing OLED displays, thereby expanding the applications for OLED microdisplays.\n\nOur proprietary technology in OLED microdisplays lies mainly in the design of the integrated circuits or \"backplane” upon which OLED microdisplays are built. The backplane drives the performance of the display.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nWe have engaged foundry services for the fabrication of the Lightning® OLED backplane wafers. Our model is to sell these wafers to foundries that deposit the organic material on the backplane and manufacture the displays. The deposition foundries will either sell the displays to their customers or to us for resale to our customers. We believe this outsourcing model allows us to leverage our underlying backplane intellectual property as well as the existing infrastructure to obtain lower cost manufacturing and avail ourselves of manufacturing technology improvements as they occur.\n\nCurrently we have several OLED microdisplays including a 2K display with 2048 x 2048 resolution in a 0.99” diagonal size, which are aimed at VR and Mixed Reality applications; and a 720p display with 1280 x 720 resolution in a 0.49” diagonal size, which is aimed at AR applications. We have also demonstrated a 2.6K x 2.6K with 2560 x 2560 resolution in a 1.3” diagonal display, which is aimed at VR applications, and a QVGA display with 1280 x 960 resolution in a 0.5” diagonal size, which is aimed at electronic viewfinder and AR applications. Our OLED microdisplays have a combo C-PHY/D-PHY Mobile Industry Processor Interface and display stream compression to allow 120 Hz operation at full resolution. This display is designed for high-end VR and content streaming applications.\n\nWe offer MicroLED microdisplays which offer the possibility of high brightness, wide viewing angle, excellent contrast, and low cost. Like our OLED strategy, Kopin’s approach is to design the backplane and use foundry partners for the production of the displays. Kopin is working with potential customers to explore the potential benefits and implementation of the technology. Currently MicroLEDs are expensive to manufacture, in order to make them commercially viable we expect that high-volume manufacturing process development may be required, including the development of equipment.\n\nBy offering transmissive, reflective, and emissive microdisplays technologies today and working with potential customers for MicroLEDs in the future, we believe we can uniquely support whichever technology is best suited for a given application. Transmissive and reflective AMLCDs are typically used in bright light conditions as their brightness can be modulated over a wide range by controlling the backlight operation. OLED displays currently have less brightness range but offer superior contrast and response time characteristics and therefore are better suited in an immersive products environment that blocks out ambient light. MicroLEDs hold the promise of brightness, high contrast, superior response time and low cost.\n\n_Optical Lenses and Backlights_\n\nWe offer a variety of optical lenses, some of which we have developed internally and others for which we license the rights to sell. We also offer a variety of backlights, some of which we have developed internally and some of which are \"off-the-shelf” components. The lenses come in a variety of sizes with the smallest being our Pupil™, followed by our Pearl™ and Pancake™ lenses. The different sizes of lenses give us and our customers design flexibility when creating headset systems. There is a trade-off between the lens size and the size of the perceived image to the viewer. For example, a Pearl™ lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking directly at a smartphone, whereas a Pancake™ lens will provide the viewer with an immersive experience. We use third parties to manufacture these lenses.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n_Headset Systems_\n\nWe license a wireless industrial headset reference design to customers that is a head-worn computer that connects to the Internet wirelessly and includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a microprocessor, battery, camera, memory, and various commercially available software packages that we license. We also licensed an industrial headset reference design that attaches to a pair of safety glasses, includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a camera, is operated primarily using voice and is tethered to an information source, such as a smartphone, via a wire. The display module or optical pod allows users to view information such as maintenance diagrams and instruction sets, Internet data, emails, text messages, maps, or other data at a \"normal” size because of our specialized optics. Our industrial headsets provide the capability of viewing technical diagrams, by enabling the user to zoom in to see finer details or zoom out to see a larger perspective. We are also developing a headset for the medical market.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nOur product strategy is to enter Funded Research and Development programs with U.S. defense prime contractors to invent, develop, manufacture, and sell (or license) leading-edge critical technology and microdisplays components and subassemblies that will be used in rugged environments. We intend to use the know-how gained and technology developed from these defense development programs and products to create products that can be used in industrial, enterprise, medical and ultimately consumer applications. The products we develop typically include a microdisplay, optics, and an ASIC in a sealed housing. The products we make for the defense market must be able to withstand the extreme shock and vibration experienced in weapons fire. Accordingly, our intellectual property includes not just our patented microdisplays and a broad range of optics but also our know-how to manufacture products that can withstand the shock and vibration of weapons fire and extreme environments. The critical elements of our strategy include:\n\n● | _Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property._ We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets and we have been accumulating a significant patent and know-how portfolio either by internal efforts or through acquisition. We own, exclusively license, or have the exclusive right to sublicense approximately 200 patents and patent applications issued and/or pending worldwide. An important piece of our strategy is to continue to accumulate valuable patented and non-patented technical know-how relating to our microdisplays, including backplane design, optics and other critical technologies for subassemblies and headsets.  \n---|---  \n● | _Maintain Our Technological Leadership in Defense and Industrial Markets._ We are a recognized leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-resolution microdisplay components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications. We believe our ability to continue to develop components and subassemblies for defense applications enhances our opportunity to grow within our other non-defense targeted markets such as industrial, medical, and eventually AR and VR consumer markets. We perform research and development contracts for U.S. Government agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government. Under these contracts, the U.S. Government funds all or a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation microdisplays, related technologies and products for aviation systems such as pilot helmets, soldier-centric systems such as rifle weapon sights, training and simulation systems and armored vehicles. This enables us to supplement our internal research and development budget with additional funding and adds to our expertise in technology, products, and systems.  \n● | _Understand Our Customers’ Needs._ We believe our system know-how, be it a defense, industrial or consumer system, is a compelling reason why customers choose Kopin as their supplier. Unlike many of our competitors who only offer a display, we offer a range of display technologies, optics, backlights, and ASICs as either an individual component or in a system. We believe this enables us to provide superior technology solutions for our customers’ needs. Additionally, our human-factors and system understanding enables us to offer our customers valuable engineering services to solve their issues and reduce time to market for their products.  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \n● | _Internally Manufactured Products and Use of Third-Party Manufacturing._ We design and manufacture our transmissive and reflective display products in facilities that we lease and manage. However, the initial manufacturing steps for fabricating the silicon wafers are performed at capital-intensive Taiwan foundries. With OLED displays, which we design the critical backplane, we use silicon wafer foundries to produce our electronic wafers based on our backplane designs, and then we use OLED deposition foundries to perform the OLED deposition steps on the electronic wafers to produce our displays. The use of these third-party foundries reduces our investments in plant and equipment and working capital for new products and enables us to update designs as technology and manufacturing trends change.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Markets and Customers**\n\nOur business model is to primarily generate product revenues by selling display components, subassemblies and headsets to customers who offer defense, industrial, or medical products and to a lesser extent license our system designs and know-how. Eventually we believe our technologies can generate revenues in the consumer AR and VR markets if we successfully develop differentiated products at an acceptable price point. We also enter development contracts from customers to either design custom products for them or help them integrate our technology into their products (Funded Research and Development).\n\nWe currently sell our display products to our customers in various configurations including but not limited to a single display component, a subassembly that includes a display, optic, backlight and focus mechanism and electronics, a binocular display subassembly that includes two displays, lenses, and backlights, and as a subassembly (also known as an HLA) for defense customers. An HLA is like a module but includes additional components such as an eye cup specific to a defense application and is designed for extreme shock, vibration and hostile environments.\n\nWe have sold our AMLCD products to Collins Aerospace, Elbit, and DRS RSTA Inc. for use in defense applications, and to RealWear and Iristik for industrial wearable products. We have sold our LCOS display products to Saki, Jutze and Mirtec for use in 3D optical inspection equipment. Our revenues from our OLED and MicroLED displays have primarily been from development contracts with customers that are designing our displays into their products.\n\nFor our AMLCD display products to function properly in their intended applications, ASICs and backlights are generally required. Several companies have designed ASICs to work with our display products and our customers can procure these chip sets directly from the manufacturer or through us.\n\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, sales to defense customers, excluding research and development contracts, as a percentage of total revenue were 56%, 52% and 40%, respectively. For fiscal year 2023, Collins Aerospace and DRS Network & Imaging Systems LLC accounted for approximately 27% and 33% of our revenues, respectively.\n\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development revenues, primarily from multiple contracts with various prime contractors of U.S. Government agencies, accounted for approximately 33%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues.\n\n**Product Development**\n\nWe believe that continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with our customers to continue our product development efforts. Our primary internal development efforts are focused on AMLCD display subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and OLED display components for defense, industrial and medical applications. Our customer funded development efforts are primarily focused on MicroLED display development.\n\nWe have also begun developing software defined backplanes which support Artificial Intelligence focused on solving specific use cases in the Defense and Consumer markets called our NeuralDisplay™ product line.\n\n_Component Products and Subassemblies_\n\nThe pixel size of our current AMLCD transmissive display products ranges from 6.8 to 15 microns. These pixel sizes are much smaller than a pixel size of approximately 100 microns in a typical laptop computer display. The resolutions of our current commercially available AMLCD display products are 428 x 240, 640 x 360, 640 x 480, 854 x 480, 800 x 600, 1,280 x 720 and 1,280 x 1,024 and 2048 x 2048 pixels. The pixel size of our current reflective display products ranges from 8.2 to 13.6 microns. The resolutions of our current commercially available reflective display products are 1,280 x 768, 1,280 x 1,024, 2,048 x 1,536, and 2,048 x 2,048 pixels.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nOur AMLCD display product development efforts are primarily focused on improving performance and reducing manufacturing costs. We are continually evaluating our display manufacturing process to reduce costs. Our defense products include subassemblies, and our defense subassemblies are referred to as HLAs. The HLA may include a display and multiple optical lenses in a hermetically sealed housing. The HLAs are made to very exact tolerances, which require Kopin to manage its supply chain to procure raw materials that meet specification while enabling Kopin to achieve high yields.\n\nOur LCOS display product development efforts are also primarily focused on improving performance and reducing manufacturing costs. Our LCOS displays are offered with resolutions that range from approximately 1280 x 768 pixels (\"WXGA”) resolution to 2K resolution.\n\nThe pixel size of our current OLED displays ranges from 7.8 to 9.2 microns with resolutions of 1,280 x 720, 2,048 x 2,048 and 2,560 x 2,560. We have only recently commenced offering OLED displays and therefore our OLED products are much less mature than our AMLCD products. Our MicroLED products are still in the development stage.\n\nWe offer components such as our optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs, manufactured to our specifications, which we then buy and resell. The components that are made to order rely on either intellectual property we developed or acquired or that we license from third parties.\n\n**Funded Research and Development**\n\nWe have entered various development contracts with agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. These contracts help support the continued development of our core technologies. We intend to continue to pursue development contracts for applications that relate to our defense and commercial product applications. Our contracts contain certain milestones relating to technology development and may be terminated prior to completion of funding. Our customer funded development projects often lead to a product or component supply agreement. Our policy is to retain our proprietary rights with respect to the principal commercial applications of our technology, however, we are not always able to retain our proprietary rights. To the extent technology development has been funded by a U.S. federal agency, under applicable U.S. federal laws the federal agency that provided the funding has the right to obtain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, fully paid license to practice or have practiced this technology for governmental use. In addition, we may be required to negotiate intellectual property rights with our defense prime contractors. For our commercial development agreements, customers often obtain exclusive rights to a particular display or technology that is developed either permanently or for some period. Revenues attributable to research and development contracts for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled $13.5 million, $14.4 million and $14.7 million, respectively.\n\n**Competition**\n\nKopin’s strategy is to focus on providing our customers with application specific optical solutions which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. We offer display technologies, from our portfolio of display technologies (MicroLED, OLED, LCOS and AMLCD), with specific optical designs, and drive electronics in a subassembly for the customer’s particular application. Typically, our product offerings provide a digital image which is overlayed on the analog world.\n\nThe general commercial display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large Asian-based electronics companies, including AUO, BOE Technology Group, Himax, LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Texas Instruments. In addition, several companies focus on OLED microdisplays including BOE Technology Group, Lakeside, MicroOLED, Olightek, Seeya, Seiko Epson and Sony. The display market consists of multiple segments, each focusing on different end-user applications applying different technologies. Competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics, product quality, size, and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. The success of our display product offerings will also depend upon the adoption of our display products by customers as an alternative to other active-matrix LCDs or OLEDs and upon our ability to compete against other types of well-established display products and new emerging display products. Particularly significant is a user’s willingness to use a near-eye display device, as opposed to a direct-view display that may be viewed from several inches to several feet. Assuming a user is willing to use a near-eye display device, companies such as Apple, Meta, and Samsung are offering near-eye virtual reality headset products that use large display panels on glass to provide the image as opposed to using microdisplays. Displays on glass typically have lower resolution than our products but are lower in cost on a per square inch basis. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against these companies and technologies, or that consumers will accept the use of such eyewear in general or our customers’ product form factor specifically.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nThere are also several AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED and alternative display technologies in development and production. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or are developing products based on these technologies. We outsource the manufacturing of our OLED displays to Chinese and European foundries. We expect these foundries to offer their own products. Our display products will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies.\n\nThere are many companies whose sole business is the development and manufacture of optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs. These companies may have significantly more intellectual property and experience than we do in the design and development of these components. We do not manufacture optical lenses, backlights, or ASICs but we either have them made to our specifications or buy standard off-the-shelf products.\n\n**Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses**\n\nAn important part of our product development strategy is to seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology using various U.S. and foreign patents and contractual arrangements. We intend to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively. Many of our U.S. patents and applications have counterpart foreign patents, foreign patent applications or international patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty.\n\n**Human Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, our consolidated business employed 144 individuals. Of these employees, 3 hold Ph.D. degrees in Material Science, Electrical Engineering or Physics. Our management and professional employees have significant prior experience in semiconductor materials, device transistor and display processing, optical design, manufacturing, and other related technologies. Our employees are in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the laws regarding employee relationships are different by jurisdiction. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have policies to prevent discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. We take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national origin. We also take affirmative action to employ and advance veterans in employment. We consider relations with our employees to be good.\n\nIn 2004, we finalized and adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics regarding the standards of conduct of our directors, officers and employees. The code is reviewed and updated periodically by our Board of Directors and is available on our website at www.kopin.com.\n\n**Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Initiatives**\n\nWe strive to create and maintain a working environment that fosters honesty and hard work and rewards all of our employees’ hard work. We endeavor to make Kopin Corporation a place people are proud to be associated with. With the growing awareness of environmental and social issues, we are in the process of creating a more formalized ESG strategy. Our initial process for the strategy creation includes work by a cross-functional ESG team of leaders representing operations, human resources, supply chain, finance, marketing, and facilities departments. We also utilize third-party facility, environmental and legal consulting services. These third-party consultants are assisting us in creating an ESG materiality assessment from which we can develop a baseline assessment for monitoring our progress. Our progress in creating our ESG strategy and other related activities are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nWe provide recurring company-wide communication of our formalized values, a summary of which are:\n\nIntegrity | Team | Customers  \n---|---|---  \nUphold Ethical Standards in Our Performance | Treat Everyone with Respect | Highest Quality Customer Service Through Collaborative Success  \nKeep Our Commitments | Encourage Open Communication | Provide Industry Leading Products  \nProtect Our Intellectual Property | Promote Critical Thinking and Innovation | Maintain Confidentiality and Protect Customer Intellectual Property  \n  \nWe are not a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (\"RBA”); however, we have utilized the themes of the RBA Code of Conduct to supplement our Code of Ethics, including the RBA Code of Conduct’s five critical areas of corporate social responsibility: labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. We believe that by following the values noted above and doing our part in each of these areas, we can achieve our business objectives and long-term stockholder value. For additional information, see \"Item 1 – Business: Human Capital Resources” in this Form 10-K.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_We strive to create a workplace based on the following principles and goals:_\n\n_Care for Our People_\n\n● We believe in upholding the principles of human rights, worker safety, and observing fair labor practices within our organization.\n\n● We respect different viewpoints and perspectives, and ultimately individual thoughts create innovation and achieve better results. We continually evaluate how we provide organizational training, formalize company values, and revitalize recruitment strategy.\n\n● We are committed to employee safety. We have installed safety protocols and monitoring systems. We have periodic audits by third parties to test our systems and perform preventive maintenance. Our policies prohibit an employee from being alone in our production facilities or in unsupervised areas of our facilities.\n\n_Environmental Responsibility_\n\n● We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We maintain an environmental management system and a specific framework for implementing relevant sustainable practices.\n\n● We ask our employees to help us contribute towards environmental sustainability by looking for opportunities to conserve energy, reduce consumption of natural resources, preserve air and water quality, manage waste properly, reuse and recycle, and reduce the use of toxic substances in our operations where possible, including, in particular, in our clean room and lab facilities. Our clean room facility emissions are less than permitting and reporting thresholds, and we track emissions monthly to verify compliance with the regulations.\n\n● We look for ways to reduce energy consumption in our facilities around the world, including upgrades and/or retrofits to smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. For instance, we have installed variable speed fans, which only turn on based on various metrics, thereby reducing energy usage.\n\n_Ethics & Corporate Responsibility_\n\n● We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance and embracing diversity and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization.\n\n● We are committed to observing fair, transparent, and accountable operating practices.\n\n● We seek to create and foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we promote an ethical organizational culture and encourage all employees to raise questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues and company policies and to offer suggestions about how we can make our organization better. We have a Whistleblower Ethics Hotline that includes global telephone access and online access. We have an independent third party periodically test the Whistleblower Ethics Hotline.\n\n_Supply Chain Responsibility_\n\n● We intend to request that our suppliers adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent by flowing this requirement through our commercial contracts.\n\n● We also adhere to Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act and support efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, we adopted the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seek to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from our suppliers each year, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. We do not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (collectively referred to as 3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and we are in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Government Regulations**\n\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including but not limited to branches of the Department of Defense (\"DoD”).\n\nU.S. defense contractors are among our largest customers, representing a substantial majority of our total revenues. The U.S. Government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either \"for convenience” (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and possibly profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations including the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production or cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Certain chemicals we import are subject to regulation by the U.S. Government. If we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable laws, we could be subject to adverse government actions and may not be able to import critical supplies.\n\nWe are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR”) laws which regulate the protection (cybersecurity) and export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use such data or products for defense purposes. Cybersecurity and data security and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products, or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nWe are also subject to federal importation laws that regulate the importation of raw materials and equipment from other nations that are used in our products. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations.\n\n**Investments in Related Businesses**\n\nOn September 30, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Solos Technology Limited (\"Solos Technology”), pursuant to which we sold and licensed certain assets of our Solos product line and Whisper Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction, we received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology’s parent company, Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). Our 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing after which we will need to participate in future equity offerings, or our ownership percentage will be diluted.\n\nWe acquired an equity interest in Lenovo New Vision in the first quarter of 2018 for $1.0 million and the contribution of certain intellectual property. As of December 30, 2023, we own approximately 10% interest in this investment and the carrying value of our investment is $1.5 million.\n\nWe acquired a right to an equity interest in a medical device company in 2021. As of December 30, 2023, the carrying value of this investment is $0.3 million.\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, we own 100% of the outstanding common stock of NVIS, Inc (\"NVIS”), FDD, and e-MDT America Inc. (\"eMDT”) and we consolidate each of their financial results within our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe terminated operations of our subsidiary, Kopin Software Ltd., in the third quarter of 2019 and are in the process of liquidating it.\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with our Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Technology License agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to Lightning Silicon if they achieve certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President, CEO and Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer, terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is also the founder of LST.\n\nWe may from time to time make further equity investments in these and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of our business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies we need to invest in to enhance our product offering. These investments may not provide us with any financial return or other benefit, and any losses by these companies or associated losses in our investments may negatively impact our operating results.\n\n**Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components**\n\nWe rely on third-party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets, backlights and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers and chemicals. In addition, our CyberDisplay subassemblies, HLAs, binocular display modules, and other modules include lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components that we purchase from third-party suppliers. Some of these third-party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, our defense customers typically buy a small number of units, which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. As a result, we are highly dependent on a select number of third-party contractors and suppliers.\n\n**Availability of Information**\n\nWe make available free of charge through our website, www.kopin.com, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished, as well as certain of our corporate governance policies, including the charters for the Board of Directors’ audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees and our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and whistleblower policy. We will also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of any of the foregoing materials. Any such request must be made in writing to us, c/o Investor Relations, Kopin Corporation, 125 North Drive, Westborough, MA, 01581.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1A.** | **_Risk Factors_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. Accordingly, our business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe to be material may also negatively affect our business and financial results. The risk factors set forth below describe what we believe to be the material risks and uncertainties related to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. We have included the risk factors below without any reflection on the relative importance of, or likelihood of, any particular risk factor.\n\n_We have experienced a history of losses, have a significant accumulated deficit, have had negative cash flow from operating activities in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, and expect to have negative cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year 2024_. Since inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. As of December 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $358.2 million. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $17.9 million and $12.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and marketable debt securities, respectively. For the years 2023 and 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $15.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively. The increase in our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily due to gross proceeds of $22.9 million received from the sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per share. We plan to continue to invest in research and development even during periods when we are not profitable, which may result in our incurring losses from operations and negative cash flow. If we do not soon achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability, our financial condition will ultimately be materially and adversely affected, and we will be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to raise any necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\n\n_Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others._ Companies in the display industry steadfastly pursue and protect their intellectual property rights. This has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity and enforceability of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. In the event that our products might infringe upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be notified, from time to time, that we could be or we are infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If we are forced to defend against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there are one or more successful claims of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease the manufacture, use, importation and/or sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to patents of third parties covering the infringing technology or using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, our business could be adversely affected. We are currently involved in an intellectual property dispute with Blue Radios, Inc., as described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. If the outcome of such a dispute is adverse to us, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that licenses will be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that damages for infringement will not be assessed or that further litigation will not occur. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of any such claims or any adverse decision or ruling relating to such litigation, including the Blue Radios litigation, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or conduct our business as we presently conduct it and as we plan to conduct it in the future.\n\n_We may be unable to manufacture our products cost effectively to meet contractual specifications or customer requirements._ Our products are required to meet specifications agreed to in purchase orders and related agreements with our customers. Our ability to produce products which meet these specifications is dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to our manufacturing processes and our vendors providing raw materials that meet the specifications we have agreed to with them. In addition, while there may be agreement with our customers on the specifications there may be ambiguity with the method to measure compliance with meeting the specifications. When we commence production of new products, we normally go through a period of low production efficiency as we modify our production processes for higher volume output and train more production employees on how to make the product. Low production efficiency means that the cost to make the product is more than what we anticipated when we accepted the purchase order from the customer. In addition, after we commence selling our products customers may request changes to the products which may also result in the low production efficiency starting again. We currently have several new products and new product configurations going to production. If the products we deliver are found to have undetected defects or latent defects when we ship them, we may incur the cost to recall the products. Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as other harm to our business. If we are unable to manufacture our products cost effectively, our revenue and ability to obtain profitability will be adversely affected.\n\n_Our revenues and cash flows could be negatively affected if sales of our display products for defense applications significantly decline or the current defense development programs are either cancelled or ultimately do not result in future product sales._ The sale of our display products to the military for use in thermal weapon sights and avionic helmets has been a primary source of our defense revenues and cash flows over the last several years. We currently are included in the Family Weapon Sight (\"FWS”) Individual program and the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) jet fighter program. In 2023 we experienced quality issues with the products we supplied for the FWS-I program. These quality issues resulted in suspension of shipments to our customer at various times during 2023 as we made modifications to our production processes. We are continuing to make modifications to our production processes as we resolve certain issues. We are in development and qualification of additional defense programs related to avionic helmets, armored vehicles and soldier rifle scopes. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military and our customers depends on our Display products remaining qualified in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, FWS and other U.S. defense programs, our customers continuing to serve as the suppliers for those programs, and on the U.S. Government/military funding these programs. We may not be awarded contracts for the systems we are in qualification for, and for the systems we are qualified for, we may only be awarded a portion of the program as the U.S. military looks to have multiple sources when possible. Even if our products qualify for these programs, the U.S. Government can opt to change suppliers, in which case demand for our products could be negatively affected. In addition, the government could postpone or cancel these programs. We believe the DoD is evaluating alternative display technologies for the F-35 Strike Fighter program and other defense programs, and we will need to develop and qualify any replacement display technologies. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military also depends on winning contracts over our competitors. If we are unable to be qualified into new U.S. defense programs, remain qualified in existing programs, or win orders against our competition, or if defense programs are not funded, then our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flow will be materially and negatively impacted.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n_Our investments in the development and sale of OLED microdisplays may not be successful, which may materially adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flow._ Historically, we have sold products that incorporate our proprietary AMLCDs. We believe that for certain applications OLED microdisplays have performance advantages and we have received future display product needs from some customers that plan to switch from AMCLDs to OLED microdisplays in the next two to three years. We are in the process of designing and developing OLED microdisplays and establishing foundry relationships to manufacture them. We expect to make additional monetary investments in their commercialization, though our plan is to outsource their production. We have little experience in production outsourcing. If we are unsuccessful in designing and developing OLED microdisplays or if we are unable to find cost-effective third-party production partners, our sales and profitability may be negatively affected.\n\n_Supply shortages have and could continue to impair the quality, reduce the availability or increase the cost of raw materials, which could harm our business._ We rely on third-party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets, backlights, and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers, and chemicals. Lead times for the parts and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as manufacturing cycle times, manufacturing yields, and the availability of raw materials used to produce the parts or components. The semiconductor industry has been and continues to experience a shortage of semiconductor components. We have experienced intermittent shortages of raw materials, which has affected our ability to manufacture and ship units. These shortages have also resulted in an increase in the cost of raw materials and semiconductor components. Our products sold for defense applications go through an expensive and long qualification period before the government will accept the products. Once the product for a defense application is accepted there are restrictions on our ability to substitute a different raw material or component for the one used in the qualification of the product. If these shortages were to further affect our supply of raw materials, our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could continue to be adversely affected, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n_Geopolitical tensions and any conflicts resulting therefrom may negatively affect our ability to source materials and components required to manufacture our products._ We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our AMLCD defense display products. We use a Chinese foundry for the deposition process in creating our OLED displays. Our reliance on these foundries involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. Geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan or China-U.S. relations could disrupt these foundries’ operations and cause these risks to materialize, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture our display products. If these foundries were to become unable to provide the required capacity, services or quality on a timely basis due to a military or other form of conflict, geopolitical tensions, or other reasons relating thereto, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our display products, or we may be forced to manufacture them in limited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms or at all.\n\n_We are in the process of transitioning from using a Chinese deposition foundry to a European foundry for certain OLED products for defense applications._ We depend principally on a Chinese foundry for the deposition process in creating our OLED displays but we are in the process of having the deposition process performed by a European foundry. If we are unsuccessful in executing our transition plan or if the transition is significantly delayed, our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could continue to be adversely affected, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n_Most of our defense sales are on a fixed-price basis, which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns._ Under a fixed-price contract, we receive only the amount indicated in the contract, regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates that we use to calculate the sales price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, we could incur losses. We have had situations where we have underestimated the cost of a program and incurred losses in fulfilling the contract. As discussed above, we are seeing a global shortage of semiconductors and other raw materials which is resulting in a significant increase in some raw material prices. In addition, the U.S. is experiencing inflation levels not seen in many years which is driving higher labor costs. Some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, scheduling, and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then our cost to perform the work could increase, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Some of the contracts we bid on have Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (\"IDIQ”) provisions. This means we are bidding a fixed price but are not assured of the quantity the government will buy or when it will buy during the term of the contract. This means we are exposed to the risk of price increases for labor, overhead and raw materials during the term of the contract. We may incur losses on fixed-price and IDIQ contracts that we had expected to be profitable, or such contracts may be less profitable than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n_The widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._ We could be negatively affected by the widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the economy on a global, national, and local level, disrupted global supply chains, and created volatility and disruption of financial markets. Responses from governmental authorities and companies to reduce the spread of the pandemic affected economic activity through various containment measures including, among others, business closures, work stoppages, quarantine and work-from-home guidelines, limiting capacity at public spaces and events, vaccination requirements, or restrictions of global and regional travel.\n\n_We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult._ We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase orders with shipment schedules within one year, and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled before shipment without significant penalty. As a result, our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time, which makes forecasting our revenues difficult. In addition, due to the absence of a substantial non-cancelable backlog, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels and the amounts we invest in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n_Fluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could adversely affect the price of our common stock._ Our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons, including:\n\n● | The timing of the initial selection of our display products as components in our customers’ new products;  \n---|---  \n● | Availability of interface electronics for our display products;  \n● | Competitive pressures on selling prices of our products;  \n● | The timing and cancellation of customer orders;  \n● | Our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis;  \n● | Our ability to successfully reduce costs;  \n● | The cancellation of U.S. Government contracts; and  \n● | Our ability to secure agreements from our major customers for the purchase of our products.  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\n\n_Our customers who purchase display products for defense applications typically incorporate our products into their products, which are sold to the U.S. Government under contracts. U.S. Government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business._ Congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis, and Congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget. Many of our customers’ contracts cover multiple years and, as such, are not fully funded at contract award. If Congress or a U.S. Government agency chooses to spend money on other programs, our customers’ contracts may be terminated for convenience. The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law. Therefore, the Anti-Deficiency Act indirectly regulates how agencies award our contracts and pay our invoices. Federal government contracts generally contain provisions that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to, among other things: terminate our existing contracts; modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors; suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders; and claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\n\nThe federal government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either \"for convenience” (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and possibly retain any profit on the work that was completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. As is common with government contractors, we have experienced occasional performance issues under some of our contracts. We have received Stop Work Orders wherein work is suspended pending a review of the program. We may in the future receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the federal government’s satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, extensive specification and performance requirements, price negotiations and milestone requirements. Each U.S. Government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply, and which can vary significantly among agencies.\n\n_We recognize revenue for some of our defense contracts and some commercial contracts on the over-time method which requires significant management judgment, and errors in our judgment could result in our revenue being overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment_. For certain contracts with the U.S. Government, we recognize revenue over time as we perform services or manufacture the goods. The continuous transfer of control to, or performance of services for, the customer is subject to liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred and may allow a reasonable profit, and take control of any work in process. Contracts with commercial customers may have a similar liability clause. In situations where control transfers or services are performed over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the contractual obligation for our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability, delivery date and cost of materials and the performance of our subcontractors. Due to the number of significant factors affecting revenue recognition, forecasting revenue at a point in time in the future is difficult. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated, and realization is considered probable. If our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect, our revenue could be overstated or understated, and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment. If our revenues and costs require adjustment, our stock price could decline.\n\n_A decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results_. In addition to the Anti-Deficiency Act, in recent years U.S. Government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated and have been difficult to predict. Future spending levels are subject to a wide range of factors, including Congressional action. In addition, in recent years the U.S. Government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a government shutdown and continuing resolutions to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. Government agencies to continue operating. Most recently, the federal government was shut down due to a lack of funding for over one month between late 2018 and early 2019. Additionally, the national debt has recently threatened to reach the statutory debt ceiling in 2024, and such an event in future years could result in the U.S. Government defaulting on its debts.\n\nAs a result, defense spending levels are difficult to predict beyond the near term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future government priorities and the state of government finances. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. Government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n_If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions._ We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government customers. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may result in fines and penalties, including contractual damages. Among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are:\n\n● | The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulates the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts;  \n---|---  \n● | The Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;  \n● | The Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based federal government contracts; and  \n● | Laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data. We engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of U.S. export control laws. Failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government.  \n  \nOur contracting agency customers may review our performance under and in compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts. If a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including:\n\n● | Termination of contracts;  \n---|---  \n● | Forfeiture of profits;  \n● | Cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses;  \n● | Suspension of payments;  \n● | Fines; and  \n● | Suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, the False Claims Act provides for substantial civil penalties where, for example, a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. Civil actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\n\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts. If we are subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, our current business, future prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.\n\nThe U.S. Government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, at any time. Any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy, be administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\n\n_Our ability to manufacture and distribute our display products would be severely limited if the foundries that we rely on to manufacture integrated circuits for our display products fail to provide those services._ We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our defense display products. In addition, we use a Chinese foundry’s services for OLED deposition and processing of OLED displays. We also use foundries in Korea and France and are evaluating other European foundries. We have no long-term contracts with the foundries we use and from time to time we have been put on allocation, which means the foundry will limit or delay the number of wafers they will process for us. If foundries were to terminate or amend their arrangement with us or become unable to provide the required capacity, services and or quality on a timely basis, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our display products or we may be forced to manufacture them in limited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms.\n\nOur reliance on these foundries involves certain risks, including but not limited to:\n\n● | Lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules;  \n---|---  \n● | Limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;  \n● | The risks associated with international commerce, including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability; and  \n● | Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, mudslides, drought, hurricanes and tornadoes.  \n  \nDue to natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons that have occasionally occurred in Asia, many Taiwanese companies, including the Taiwanese foundry we use, have experienced related business interruptions. Our business could suffer significantly if any of the foundries we use have their operations disrupted for an extended period of time due to natural disasters, political unrest or financial instability.\n\n_We may be unable to adequately control purchase pricing of certain critical materials, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability._ We have no long-term pricing contracts on foundry wafers and certain other materials that represent a significant portion of our product bill of material costs. We cannot provide assurance against supplier price increases that negatively impact the cost of producing products, which may adversely affect sales or profitability. Finding and/or qualifying a more cost-effective replacement supplier may take significant time.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n_The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully._ There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The individual components that we offer for sale (displays, optical lenses, backlights and ASICs) are also offered by companies whose sole business focuses on that individual component. For example, there are companies whose sole business is to sell optical lenses. Accordingly, our strategy requires us to develop technologies and to compete in multiple markets. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, development and marketing resources than we do. The competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.\n\nOur success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements. If we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes, our business will suffer.\n\n_Disruptions of our production could adversely affect our operating results._ If we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities, we would be unable to supply our products to our customers. Many of our sales contracts include financial penalties for late delivery. In the past, we have experienced power outages at our facilities, which ranged in duration from one to four days. We have certain critical pieces of equipment necessary to operate our facilities that are no longer offered for sale and we may not have service contracts or spare parts for the equipment. Additionally, as we introduce new equipment into our manufacturing processes, our display products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency. We may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations.\n\n_A disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations, revenue and profitability._ Our data processing systems and our Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP”) software are cloud-based and hosted by third parties. We also use software packages that are no longer supported by their developer. We have experienced short-term (i.e., a few days) interruptions in our Internet connectivity. An interruption of the third-party systems or the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the third-party systems for an extended period may affect our ability to operate our business and process transactions, which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\n\n_Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products, as well as changes in cybersecurity and if our information technology security systems were infiltrated and confidential and/or proprietary information were taken, we could be subject to fines, lawsuits and loss of customers_. Significantly larger organizations with much greater resources than us have been the victim of cybercrimes. We routinely receive emails probing our Internet security, and our Internet security systems have detected outside organizations attempting to install Trojan virus software packages in our systems. We rely on our electronic information systems to perform routine transactions to run our business. We transact business over the Internet with customers, vendors and our subsidiaries and have implemented security measures to protect against unauthorized access to this information. We have also implemented security policies that limit access via the Internet from the Company to the outside world based on the individual’s position in the Company. We routinely receive security patches from software providers for the software we use. Our primary concerns are inappropriate access to personnel information, information covered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, product designs and manufacturing information, financial information and our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how. Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyberattacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. Cybersecurity threats are continuously evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, proprietary, or otherwise protected information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. Any such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential, proprietary, or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. The threats we face are continuous and evolving and vary in degree of severity and sophistication. These threats include advanced persistent threats from highly organized adversaries, including but not limited to cyber criminals, nation states and so-called hacktivists, particularly those adverse to the security interests of the U.S. and its allies, which target us and other defense contractors. These types of threats are related to the geopolitical environment and have, therefore, grown in number due to recent geopolitical conflicts. In addition, as a result of the rapid pace of technological change, we and our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we conduct business continue to rely on legacy systems and software, which can be more vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks. Moreover, we, like other companies, are seeing an unprecedented number of previously unknown vulnerabilities, for which there are no known mitigations, being revealed by new attacks. Further, the sophistication, availability and use of artificial intelligence by threat actors present an increased level of risk. Due to the evolving threat landscape, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience more frequent and increasingly advanced cyber-attacks. In addition, changes in domestic and international cybersecurity-related laws and regulations have expanded cybersecurity-related compliance requirements, and cybersecurity regulatory enforcement activity has grown. We expect the regulatory environment to continue to evolve, and staying apace with these regulatory changes could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, and lead to new or additional information technology and product development expenses. We also face reputational, litigation and financial risks in relation to potential required disclosures and increased risk of enforcement. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats, as well as to comply with evolving regulations. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to defend against all cyber-attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In some cases, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats and attacks. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted.\n\n_We may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of our equity investments._ At December 30, 2023, we had equity investments in companies totaling $4.7 million, where we have limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments. We are required to periodically review the value of these investments for impairment. For example, in the second quarter of 2023, we reviewed the financial condition and other factors of our investment in a customer and as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment. These investments may not contribute to our earnings or cash flows. In addition, these investments may be required to raise additional capital, which may result in our ownership percentage being decreased.\n\n_If we are unable to obtain or maintain existing software license relationships or other relationships relating to the intellectual property we use, our ability to grow revenue and achieve profitability and positive cash flow may be negatively affected._ Our headset systems include software that we license from other companies. Should we violate the terms of a license, our license could be canceled. Companies may decide to stop supporting the software we license, or new versions of the software may not be compatible with our software, which would require us to rewrite our software, which we may not be able to do. Moreover, the license fees we pay may be increased, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n_We may incur substantial costs in defending our intellectual property and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights._ Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems, and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. We have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. Our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ or consulting for us. These measures may not adequately protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws afford only limited protection and our patents could be invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not provide full protection of our intellectual property rights. Misappropriation of our technology and the costs of defending our intellectual property rights from misappropriation could substantially impair our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may not be successful, and the price of our common stock may decline.\n\n_The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from currently pending or future patent applications. We cannot be certain that domestic or foreign intellectual property laws will allow the protection of our intellectual property rights or that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around any patents issued or licensed to us._ We may be subject to or may initiate contested patent or patent application proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, foreign patent offices or the courts, which can demand significant financial and management resources. Patent applications in the U.S. typically are maintained in secrecy until they are published about 18 months after their earliest claim to priority. As publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive of inventions covered by our pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. We also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications or those of our licensors will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide adequate protection against a competitor. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license or could force us to retool or cease manufacturing and sales of products covered by these patents, nor can we be sure that licenses, if needed, would be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\n\n_We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. We believe that our future success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees in addition to patent ownership._ Our employees enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ. Agreements with consultants generally provide that rights to inventions made by them while consulting for us will be assigned to us unless the assignment of rights is prohibited by the terms of any of their prior agreements. Agreements with employees, consultants and collaborators contain provisions intended to further protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. To date, we have had no experience in enforcing these agreements. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breaches. Our trade secrets may not be secure from discovery or independent development by competitors, in which case we may not be able to rely on these trade secrets to prevent our competitors from using them.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n_Our business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel._ To continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business, we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business. Our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees. The loss of the services of one or more key employees, including Mr. Murray, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could seriously impede our success. We do not maintain any \"key-man” insurance policies on Mr. Murray or any other employees. In addition, due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers, our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management, technical, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions. Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to develop and manufacture our products.\n\n_If we fail to keep pace with changing technologies, we may lose customers._ Rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving technologies and industry standards characterize our industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences. We may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\n_Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us._ The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act”) imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We have incurred additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins of all metals used in our products. We purchase materials from foreign sources that may not cooperate and provide us with the necessary information to allow us to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. This may require us to find alternative sources, which could delay product shipments. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict-free.\n\n_Changes in tax laws, an unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity._ We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Korea, China and the United Kingdom. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally changes the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\n\n_We may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental laws and regulations and the ITAR, or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past._ We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic or other hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. We are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws that regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use these products for defense purposes. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not violated applicable laws or regulations in the past, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n_We may be unable to modify our products to meet regulatory or customer requirements._ From time to time our display products are subject to new domestic and international requirements, such as the European Union’s Restriction on Hazardous Substances Directive. Our customers’ terms and conditions require us to be in compliance with \"all laws.” If we are unable to comply with these regulations, we may not be permitted to ship our products, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to maintain profitability. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of laws, we may be subject to fines and penalties.\n\n_We may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions and investments, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._ In the past, we have made, and in the future, we may make acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, products and technologies that could complement or expand our business. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our existing business and products. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets.\n\nAdditionally, we have several investments where we may have limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting, and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments. As a result, these investments may not contribute to our earnings or cash flows. In addition, these investments may be required to raise additional capital, which may result in our ownership percentage being decreased.\n\n_Changes in China’s laws, legal protections or government policies on foreign investment in China may harm our business._ Our business and corporate transactions are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China as well as laws and regulations applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. These laws and regulations frequently change, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to us. Regulations and rules on foreign investments in China impose restrictions on the means that a foreign investor like us may apply to facilitate corporate transactions we may undertake. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. If any of our past operations are deemed to be non-compliant with Chinese law, we may be subject to penalties and our business and operations may be adversely affected. For instance, under the catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, some industries are categorized as sectors that are encouraged, restricted or prohibited for foreign investment. As the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries is updated every few years, there can be no assurance that China’s government will not change its policies in a manner that would render part or all of our business to fall within the restricted or prohibited categories. If we cannot obtain approval from relevant authorities to engage in businesses that have become prohibited or restricted for foreign investors, we may be forced to sell or restructure such businesses. Furthermore, China’s government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. If we are forced to adjust our corporate structure or business as a result of changes in government policy on foreign investment or changes in the interpretation and application of existing or new laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed. Moreover, uncertainties in the Chinese legal system may impede our ability to enforce contracts with our business partners, customers and suppliers, or otherwise pursue claims in litigation to recover damages or loss of property, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n_Raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict our operations._ To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. We may sell shares or other securities in other offerings at a price per share that is less than the prices per share paid by other investors, and investors purchasing shares of our common stock or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders.\n\n_We have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment during that time is if the price of our common stock appreciates._ Historically, our earnings, if any, have been retained for the development of our businesses. Any recommendation by our Board of Directors to pay dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, and other factors. Accordingly, if the price of our common stock declines in the foreseeable future, you will incur a loss on your investment, without the likelihood that this loss will be offset in part or at all by potential future cash dividends.\n\n_Our operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects._ Credit rating downgrades in certain European countries and/or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the EU create uncertain global economic conditions. The ongoing uncertainty could have a negative economic impact and result in further volatility in the markets for several years. The impact of the Brexit referendum and such ongoing uncertainty may result in various economic and financial consequences for businesses operating in the UK, the EU and beyond. We hold significant assets in the UK and operate a UK subsidiary, and the future impacts of Brexit and the continued uncertainty surrounding the EU could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n_Changes in government trade policies may increase the cost of our products, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability._ We depend on a Taiwanese foundry for the manufacture of integrated circuits for our AMLCD display products and on Chinese and Korean foundries for our OLED display products. In recent years the U.S. has imposed, among other actions, new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from China in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices, and China has responded by proposing or implementing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the U.S. Tariffs on components that we import from China or other nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs have in some cases and may in the future cause our expenses to increase, which would adversely affect our profitability unless we were able to exclude our products from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. In addition, future actions or escalations by either the U.S. or China that affect trade relations may also affect our business or that of our suppliers or customers, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take. Moreover, it is uncertain to what extent, if any, the U.S. tariffs on components that we import from China will affect the Taiwanese foundries on which we depend, in part because many Taiwanese foundries conduct parts of their manufacturing in China.\n\nA protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. To the extent that our sales or profitability are affected negatively by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\n_As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._ While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1B.** | **_Unresolved Staff Comments_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 1C.** | **_Cybersecurity_**  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a company selling products for defense applications, we may be the target of cyber-attacks from a variety of threat actors. Cybersecurity threats include attacks on, or other attempts to infiltrate, our information technology (IT) infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers, and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attempts to infiltrate our products or services, including attacks targeting the security, confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities, or infrastructure.\n\nOur Cybersecurity Program\n\nOur products and services are normally classified as EAR 99 by the U.S. government, but our defense customers may ask us to make some alterations for the environments the products will be used in. Moreover, our products sold for defense applications are integrated with our customers’ products and these customers may provide us with Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that requires, safeguarding and dissemination controls in accordance with laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies. Given the nature of our business and the cybersecurity risks we face, we have instituted a cybersecurity program for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks, which include material risks from cybersecurity threats to our internal systems, our products, services and programs for customers, and our supply chain.\n\nOur enterprise cybersecurity program aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, among others. The program includes processes and controls for the deployment of new IT systems by the Company and controls over new and existing system operations. We, or third parties we contract with, monitor and conduct regular testing of these controls and systems, including vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to regularly assess patching and configuration status. In addition, we require our employees to complete annual cybersecurity training, and we regularly conduct simulated phishing and cyber-related communications.\n\nIncident Response.\n\nOur cybersecurity program includes monitoring for potential security threats that may lead to vulnerabilities. We evaluate and assign severity levels to incidents, escalate and engage an incident response team based on severity, and manage and mitigate the related risks. Incidents are reported internally to members of senior management and/or the Board of Directors as appropriate based on severity and incident type and are also analyzed for external reporting requirements. Our incident response process is also designed to coordinate functions to enable continuity of essential business operation in the event of a cyber crisis.\n\nThird Party Service Providers.\n\nWe engage third party service providers to expand the capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program, including for design, monitoring and testing of the program’s risk prevention and protection measures, and process execution including incident detection, investigation, analysis and response, eradication, and recovery.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nProgram Assessment.\n\nWe continuously evaluate and seek to improve and mature our cybersecurity processes. Our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed through management self-evaluation and ongoing monitoring procedures to evaluate our program effectiveness, including assessments associated with internal controls over financial reporting as well as vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to validate patching and configuration. As cybersecurity threats are continuously evolving, we also periodically engage with third parties to perform maturity assessments of our program to identify potential risk areas and improvement opportunities. This includes assessment of our overall program, policies and processes, compliance with regulatory requirements and an overall assessment of key vulnerabilities. We use these assessments to supplement our own evaluation of the overall health of our program and target improvement areas.\n\nBoard Oversight and Management’s Role\n\nOur Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee also considers enterprise cybersecurity risks in connection with its financial and compliance risk oversight role. The Chief Financial Officer regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the status of the Company’s cybersecurity program and provides the Board with the annual assessment by a third party on the Company’s cybersecurity program. Cybersecurity risks are also included with the Company’s annual business risk assessment which is provided to the Board of Directors.\n\nFor more information on risks related to cybersecurity, see Item IA. \"Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\n\n**Item 2.** | **_Properties_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe lease our 74,000 square foot production facility in Westborough, Massachusetts, 10,000 square feet of which is contiguous environmentally controlled production clean rooms operated between Class 10 and Class 1,000 levels.\n\nNVIS, our subsidiary in Reston, Virginia, leases 6,100 square feet in Reston. FDD, our subsidiary in Scotland, leases 20,000 square feet in Dalgety Bay, 5,000 square feet of which is contiguous environmentally controlled production clean rooms operated between Class 10 and Class 10,000 levels. FDD also leases an office in Berlin, Germany.\n\nAt this time, we believe these properties are suitable for our needs for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Item 3.** | **_Legal Proceedings_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (\"the Court”), alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning an alleged joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleges that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications, and denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. Additional factual and expert discovery ordered by The Court has been completed. A trial date has been set by the Court for March 20, 2024. The Company has not concluded a loss from this matter is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation or claims related to this matter for the period ended December 30, 2023. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\n\n**Item 4.** | **_Mine Safety Disclosures_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**Part II**\n\n**Item 5.** | **_Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities._**  \n---|---  \n  \nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"KOPN”.\n\nAs of March 7, 2024, there were approximately 291 shareholders of record of our common stock, which does not reflect those shares held beneficially or those shares held in \"street” name.\n\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past, nor do we expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks discussed in \"Item 1A- Risk Factors”, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Please refer to our cautionary note on Forward-Looking Statements on page 3 of this Form 10-K._\n\nWe are a leading developer and provider of high-performance application-specific optical solutions consisting of high-resolution microdisplays and optics, microdisplays subassemblies and headsets. We define microdisplays as displays that have a diagonal measurement of less than 2 inches. Our products are used for defense applications (soldier thermal weapon rifle sights, avionic fixed and rotary wing pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training & simulation headsets); industrial and medical headsets; and 3D optical inspection systems. We believe that the technologies we are developing may eventually be used in consumer augmented reality (\"AR”) and virtual reality (\"VR”) wearable headsets systems. Our products are primarily used to overlay digital information on the real-world scene.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition under the cost-to-cost measurement method, bad debts, inventories, warranty reserves, investment valuations, valuation of stock compensation awards, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nSubstantially all of our product revenues are derived from the sales of microdisplays, which are sold as individual displays, modules that include electronics and optics, or higher-level subassemblies for use in defense, industrial and consumer near-eye applications such as avionic helmets, thermal weapon sights or virtual reality headsets. We also have development contracts for the design, manufacture and modification of products for the U.S. Government or a prime contractor for the U.S. Government or for a customer that sells into the industrial or consumer markets. The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR”) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer.\n\nOur fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government or other customers may result in revenue recognized in excess of amounts currently billed. We disclose the excess of revenues over amounts actually billed as Contract assets and unbilled receivables on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the balance sheets. In some instances, the U.S. Government retains a small portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. The portion of the payments retained until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government, we typically receive interim payments either as work progresses, by achieving certain milestones or based on a schedule in the contract. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned on the balance sheets. The advanced payment typically is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For industrial and consumer purchase orders, we typically receive payments within 30 to 60 days of shipment of the product, although for some purchase orders, we may require advanced payment prior to shipment of the product.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts with the same customer, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of our development contracts and contracts with the U.S. Government, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a set of components into a single unit. Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less frequently, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. In cases where we sell standard products, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\n\nFor certain contracts with the U.S. Government, the Company recognizes revenue over time as we deliver goods or perform services because of continuous transfer of control to the customer and the lack of an alternative use for the product. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is subject to liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. For contracts with commercial customers, while the contract may have a similar liability clause, our products historically have an alternative use and thus, revenue is recognized at a point in time.\n\nIn situations where control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation for our contracts because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\n\nAccounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials and performance by our subcontractors. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. If our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone achievement is incorrect, our revenue could be overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nFor our commercial customers, the Company’s revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and the Company transfers control of the products or performs services, which is generally upon delivery of the product to the customer or performance of the services. Revenue is recorded as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Provisions for product returns and allowances are reductions in the transaction price and are recorded in the same period as the related revenues. We analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances. Certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products. Sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors’ customers and not for stocking of inventory. Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n\nThe Company also licenses its intellectual property (\"IP”) through technology license agreements which provides the customer the right to use our IP as it exists at a point in time. These agreements may include other performance obligations including the sale of product to the customer. The satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation, and related recognition of revenue, occurs when the IP is delivered to the customer, the license period has begun and there are no additional performance obligations in the agreement. When the license is distinct from other obligations in the agreement, the Company treats the license and other performance obligations as separate performance obligations. Accordingly, the license is recognized at a point in time or over time based on the standalone selling price. Under certain license agreements, we may receive royalties based on the sales of the licensed product. We recognize royalty revenue upon the later of when the related sales occur, or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under our current license agreements for which a royalty exists, we have recorded revenue when the related sales by our customer occurs because the performance obligation related to the delivery of the license to the customer has been satisfied.\n\n_Inventory_\n\nWe provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans. Inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved (representing the estimated net realizable value) as such information becomes available. Our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non-binding demand forecasts provided by our customers, lead times for raw materials, lead time for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields. If a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand, we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required. If we were unable to sell the excess inventory, we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value (generally zero).\n\n_Investment Valuation_\n\nWe periodically make equity investments in private companies, accounted for as an equity investment, whose values are difficult to determine. The Company adopted ASU No. _2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities_ and the related amendments on December 31, 2017. The Company adopted the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values (often referred to as cost method investments) on a prospective basis. When assessing investments in private companies for impairment, we consider such factors as, among others, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. Because these are private companies that we do not control we may not be able to obtain all of the information we would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis. Accordingly, our estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date.\n\nIn addition to the above, we make investments in government and agency-backed securities and corporate debt securities. For all of our investments, we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The determination of whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary requires that we estimate the cash flows we expect to receive from the security. We use publicly available information such as credit ratings and financial information of the entity that issued the security in the development of our expectation of the cash flows to be received. Historically, we have periodically recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses, however we have not done so recently.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n_Income Taxes_\n\nWe have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint. We establish valuation allowances to the extent it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. These judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. Given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term. It is possible that we could pay foreign and state income taxes. We are also subject to foreign taxes from our Korean and U.K. subsidiary operations.\n\nOur income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities. Despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes or foreign tax that may be due. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Should the actual results differ from our estimates, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have historically established valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets because of our history of generating operating losses and restrictions on the use of certain items. Our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets has also included an analysis of the expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards. In forming our conclusions as to whether the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we consider the sources of our income and the projected stability of those sources and product life cycles.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe have two principal sources of revenues: product revenues and research and development (\"R&D”) revenues. R&D revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial enterprises.\n\nWe manufacture Active-matrix Liquid Crystal (\"AMLCD”) transmissive and Liquid Crystal on Silicon (\"LCOS”) reflective microdisplays. Our AMLCD display production is being performed entirely in our Westborough, Massachusetts facility. FDD, our wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures our LCOS microdisplays in its facility located in Scotland. Our OLED displays are designed by us and manufactured by third parties for us.\n\nWe are a display supplier for the U.S. Army’s Family of Weapon Sights-Individual and Joint Strike Fighter F-35 programs and are undergoing qualification for the FWS - Crew Served variant. We are also in development for new display systems for armored vehicles and a medical headset for surgeons. Our existing and new production programs are expected to increase production for the next several years. There are other firms offering products which compete against us in the defense programs and all of the programs we supply product to are subject to the U.S. Government defense budget and procurement process. Accordingly, there can be no assurances we will continue to ship under our defense contracts.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nPredicting our R&D revenue and related trends is challenging because we have limited ability to forecast whether we will be awarded additional R&D contracts in the future as such awards depend on the U.S. military budget and priorities. We cannot assure that the R&D contracts will result in workable products or if successful our products developed under these contracts will be procured by our customers. If we do not continue to win R&D contracts or if there is no demand for the products developed under these contracts, our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow could be negatively affected because the R&D revenues (or the products derived from the R&D contracts) would not be available to cover the allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs which may remain. Some of our contracts are fixed priced and we may incur cost overruns that would result in losses on the contracts. If we incur such losses on our contracts our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow could be negatively affected.\n\n**_Because our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December, every seven years we have a fiscal year with 53 weeks. Our fiscal year 2023 was a 52-week year, 2022 was a 53-week year and 2021 was a 52-week year._**\n\n_Revenues._ Our revenues by display application, which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts, for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by category, were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nDefense | $| 22,615 | $| 24,780 | $| 18,180  \nIndustrial/Enterprise | 2,736 | 6,136 | 9,710  \nConsumer | 573 | 1,497 | 1,871  \nResearch and Development | 13,455 | 14,357 | 14,669  \nOther | 13 | 7 | 121  \nLicense and royalties | 1,002 | 624 | 1,115  \nTotal Revenues | $| 40,394 | $| 47,401 | $| 45,666  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. Sales of our products for Defense applications may be for a one-time purchase or for programs that run for several years. Revenues from product sales to defense customers decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in shipments of our products for thermal weapon sight applications that was partially offset by an increase in sales of our products for defense pilot helmets and training and simulation programs.\n\nIndustrial/Enterprise applications revenues represent customers who purchase our display products for use in headsets used for manufacturing, distribution, public safety, 3D metrology equipment and other industrial applications. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and they sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The decrease in Industrial/Enterprise applications revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in sales to customers who use our display components in 3D metrology equipment and industrial headsets.\n\nSales of our displays for Consumer applications are primarily for use in thermal imaging products, recreational rifle and hand-held scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our OLED displays for consumer applications.\n\nR&D revenues decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreased funding for new display technology development for U.S. defense programs and OLED display development, which was partially offset by increased funding for armor vehicle targeting system and medical headset development. These contracts typically reimburse us for direct costs and allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs and in some cases profit. In 2023 and 2022, our R&D revenues exceeded funded R&D expenses by approximately $6.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\n\nThe increase in license and royalty revenue in 2023 compared to 2022 is due to an increase in royalties earned under IP license agreements for industrial wearable headsets.\n\nInternational product sales represented approximately 13% and 22% of product revenues for 2023 and 2022, respectively. We categorize our revenues as either domestic or international based upon the delivery destination of our product. For example, if the customer is located in Asia or if a U.S. customer has its Asian contract manufacturer order product from us and we deliver the product to Asia, we categorize both these sales as international. In addition, if we earn royalties on sales from a customer, the royalties are categorized as domestic or international based on how the product revenues are categorized. Our international sales decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to a decrease in sales of our products for 3D metrology application by our subsidiary, FDD, our OLED displays for consumer applications and industrial headset products manufactured overseas. Our international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors’ products that are denominated in local currencies, which could result in a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets. As a result, our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency. We have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations, such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations, because of the historically stable exchange rate between the Japanese yen, Great Britain pound and the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation impact on our results, if material, is described in further detail under \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section below.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. Sales of our products for Defense applications may be for a one-time purchase or for programs that run for several years. Revenues from product sales to defense customers increased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in shipments of our products into the FWS- Individual, Joint Strike Fighter and training and simulation programs.\n\nIndustrial/Enterprise applications revenues represent customers who purchase our display products for use in headsets used for manufacturing, distribution, public safety, 3D metrology equipment and other industrial applications. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and they sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The decrease in Industrial/Enterprise applications revenues in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in sales to customers who use our display components in 3D metrology equipment and industrial headsets.\n\nSales of our displays for Consumer applications are primarily for use in thermal imaging products, recreational rifle and hand-held scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to decreased demand for our organic light emitting displays (\"OLEDs”).\n\nR&D revenues decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to reduced funding for new display technology development for U.S. defense programs, which was partially offset by increased funding for OLED display development. These contracts typically reimburse us for direct costs and allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs and in some cases profit. In 2022 and 2021, our R&D revenues exceeded funded R&D expenses by approximately $4.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in license and royalty revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 is due to lower royalties earned under IP license agreements for industrial wearable headsets.\n\nInternational product sales represented approximately 22% and 38% of product revenues for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our international sales decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to a decrease in sales of our products for 3D metrology application by our subsidiary, FDD and industrial headset products manufactured overseas.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n_Cost of Product Revenues._ Cost of product revenues, which is comprised of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nCost of product revenues | $| 24,952 | $| 32,559 | $| 25,052  \nCost of product revenues as a % of net product revenues | 96.2| % | 100| % | 83.8| %  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nCost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products for defense applications in 2023 versus 2022 and lower sales of lower margin products from defense applications in 2023 versus 2022. The Company also implemented several programs and hired additional employees to improve manufacturing quality and efficiencies.\n\nThe issues associated with the global shortage of semiconductor circuit chips and other raw materials decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 and 2021. However, we have identified several semiconductor components which continue to have long lead delivery times. We continue to search for and procure all necessary components from our current vendors and new alternative vendors. In certain situations, we can obtain the components but at a significantly increased cost. The inability to procure a single component will prevent the completion of our product and the ability to sell the product. Our products go through extensive qualification processes and therefore our customers may not accept a replacement component. We are unable to determine if we will be able to obtain all necessary components for fiscal 2024. If we are unable to obtain all necessary components, we may be required to stop production, which would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nCost of product revenues increased as a percentage of revenues in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to lower production volumes in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2022. In fiscal 2022, we had lower manufacturing efficiencies driven by disruptions to the manufacturing process caused by intermittent raw material shortages and higher prices for raw materials. Also, in the third quarter of 2022, we incurred $1.0 million in warranty charges due to quality issues. In the fourth quarter of 2022, gross margins declined due to lower absorption of costs as we reduced production to make process changes in manufacturing the products.\n\n_Research and Development._ R&D expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. R&D costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of display products and allocated overhead. In fiscal year 2023, our Funded R&D expenditures were primarily related to our display products and defense systems and our Internal R&D was primarily related to the development of OLED displays. R&D expenses for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nFunded | $| 7,177 | $| 10,280 | $| 9,976  \nInternal | 3,600 | 8,388 | 6,312  \nTotal | $| 10,777 | $| 18,668 | $| 16,288  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nFunded R&D expense for 2023 decreased as compared to 2022 primarily due to the completion of contracts for defense programs awarded prior to 2023. Internal R&D expense for 2023 decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased OLED development.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nFunded R&D expense for 2022 increased as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of defense related contracts we have been awarded. Internal R&D expense for 2022 increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased OLED development.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative._ Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A”) expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and administrative and general corporate expenses. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nSelling, general and administrative expense | $| 21,842 | $| 17,965 | $| 18,101  \nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of total revenue | 54.1| % | 37.9| % | 39.6| %  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nSG&A for 2023 increased as compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase of approximately $5.0 million in legal and professional fees and $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in compensation and benefits.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nSG&A for 2022 decreased as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of approximately $2.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in compensation and benefits and $1.4 million of higher professional fees.\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n_Total Non-operating (Expense) Income._ Non-operating (expense) income is primarily composed of interest income, revaluation and impairment of equity investments, foreign currency transactions, remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our UK-based subsidiaries and other non-operating income items. Non-operating (expense) income for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | **2023** | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal non-operating (expense) income | **$** | **(2,415** | **)** | $ | 2,608 | $ | 436  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nIn 2023, we recorded $3.3 million of impairment losses on equity investments. In 2022, we recorded a gain of $4.7 million resulting from the revaluation of an equity investment. Also in 2022, we recorded a $2.0 million impairment charge on an equity investment. In 2023, we recorded $0.2 million of foreign currency losses compared to $0.3 million of foreign currency losses recorded in 2022.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nIn 2022 we recorded a gain of $4.7 million resulting from the revaluation of an equity investment. In 2022 we recorded a $2.0 million impairment charge on an equity investment. Also in 2022, we recorded $0.3 million of foreign currency losses compared to $0.1 million of foreign currency gains recorded in 2021.\n\n_Tax provision_\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nTax provision | $| (156| ) | $| (144| ) | $| (129| )  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022 of approximately $(0.2) million and $(0.1) million, respectively, was due to the accretion of additional potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities for the Company’s former Korean subsidiary.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021 of approximately $(0.1) million was due to the accretion of additional potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities for the Company’s former Korean subsidiary.\n\n_Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest._ In the first quarter of 2023, we acquired the remaining interest in eMDT. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of our majority owned subsidiaries which is allocated to the shareholders of the equity interests not owned by us. The change in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2023 compared to 2022 was less than $0.1 million and in 2022 compared to 2021 was less than $0.1 million and was the result of operations of eMDT.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and marketable securities of $17.9 million and working capital of $24.0 million compared to $12.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to gross proceeds of $22.9 million received from the sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per share. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we sold 2.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $16 million (average of $6.66 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.5 million pursuant to the Company’s At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated as of February 8, 2019 (the \"Previous ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, (\"Stifel”) as agent. In the second quarter of 2021, we sold 0.1 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.8 million (average of $6.74 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.1 million under the Previous ATM Agreement. The Previous ATM Agreement has since terminated pursuant to its terms as a result of the sale of all the shares subject to such agreement. On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a new At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Current ATM Agreement”) with Stifel under which we may sell up to $50 million of our common stock. In the third quarter of 2021, we sold 0.6 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $4.8 million (average of $8.06 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.1 million under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we sold 1.5 million shares of common stock and 0.2 million shares of treasury stock for gross proceeds of $2.1 million (average of $1.26 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of less than $0.1 million and in the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold 675,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $0.9 million (average of $1.27 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of less than $0.1 million, pursuant to the Current ATM Agreement. The net proceeds from the sale of common shares were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital. \n\nOn January 27, 2023, we sold 17 million shares of registered common stock to certain investors and issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The gross proceeds of these transactions were $22.9 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $1.5 million. At December 30, 2023, we had available $41.4 million for sale of common stock under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn February 2024, we sold 3.1 million shares of common stock under our Current ATM for gross proceeds of $7.5 million at an average per share price of $2.42 before deducting underwriting expenses of $0.2 million. Our Current ATM and our shelf registration statement expired on March 5, 2024. We expect to file a new shelf registration statement and enter into a new ATM in 2024.\n\nThe following table presents the components of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities held in U.S. dollars as of the dates presented:\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nDomestic locations | $| 17,725,979 | $| 11,778,324  \nForeign locations | 95,547 | 629,793  \nSubtotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities held in U.S. dollars | 17,821,526 | 12,408,117  \nCash and cash equivalents held in other currencies and converted to U.S. dollars | 81,159 | 239,539  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities | $| 17,902,685 | $| 12,647,656  \n  \nWe have no plans to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiary FDD.\n\nThe manufacturing operations at our Korean facility, Kowon, have ceased and Kowon was liquidated at fiscal year ended 2018. We have recorded deferred tax liabilities for any additional withholding tax that may be due to the Korean government upon Kowon’s final tax return acceptance.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nWe have incurred net losses of $19.7 million, $19.3 million and $13.4 million for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million, $17.7 million and $10.7 million for the fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our net cash outflows from operations was partially a result of funding our ongoing investments in research and development which we believe will continue. We have in the past sold equity securities through an at the market offering and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings. We estimate we will have sufficient liquidity to fund operations at least through the first quarter of 2025. Nonetheless, we monitor the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If our actual results are less than projected or we need to raise capital for additional liquidity, we may be required to do additional equity financings, reduce expenses or enter into a strategic transaction. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n**Seasonality**\n\nOur revenues have not followed a seasonal pattern for the past three years and we do not anticipate any seasonal trend to our revenues in 2024.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\nUnder our former CEO’s (\"Dr. Fan”) employment agreement, commencing in January 2023, Dr. Fan (or in the event of his death prior to completion of all installments to his surviving spouse, or if none to his estate) would receive $1,500,000 in twenty-four (24) equal monthly installments. As of December 30, 2023, we owed Dr. Fan $750,000 which will be paid in equal monthly installments during 2024. In addition, under Dr. Fan’s employment agreement he receives $40,000 per year through 2033.\n\nThe following is a summary of our contractual lease payment obligations as of December 30, 2023:\n\nPayment due by period  \n---  \nTotal | Less than 1 year | 1-3 Years | 4-5 years | More than 5 years  \nOperating Lease Obligations | $| 2,844,590 | 795,884 | 1,847,373 | 201,333 | —  \n  \n41  \n---  \n  \n**Item 7A.** | **_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe invest our excess cash in high-quality U.S. Government, government-backed (i.e., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) and corporate debt instruments, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrealized gain or loss on debt securities. We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ financial position, results of operations, and transaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash flows related to business activities in Asia and Europe, and remeasurement of U.S. dollars to the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary. We are also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials which are in U.S. dollars but the price on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations or investments is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Our portfolio of marketable debt securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments may be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. We use silicon wafers in our production processes but do not enter into forward or futures hedging contracts.\n\n**Item 8.** | **_Financial Statements and Supplementary Data_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe financial statements required by this Item are included in this Report on pages 44 through 72. Reference is made to Item 15 of this Report.\n\n**Item 9.** | **_Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 9A.** | **_Controls and Procedures_**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nIn connection with filing the Form 10-K, management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and procedures that:\n\n● | Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  \n---|---  \n● | Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  \n● | Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 30, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**Item 9B.** | **_Other Information_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 9C.** | **_Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspection_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 10.** | **_Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe information required under this item is incorporated herein by reference to our Proxy Statement relating to our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Proxy Statement”). We expect to file the Proxy Statement with the SEC in April 2024 (and, in any event, no later than 120 days after the close of our last fiscal year).\n\n_Code of Ethics_. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (\"the Code”) that applies to all of our employees (including our CEO and CFO) and directors. The Code is available on our website at www.kopin.com. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to or waiver of a provision of the Code applicable to any executive officer or director, by posting such information on our website.\n\nOur corporate governance guidelines, whistleblower policy and the charters of the audit committee, compensation committee, and nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board of Directors as well as other corporate governance document materials are available on our website at www.kopin.com under the heading \"Investors,” then \"Governance” then \"Governance Documents.”\n\n**Item 11.** | **_Executive Compensation_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference from the Proxy Statement.\n\n**Item 12.** | **_Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference from the Proxy Statement.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \n**Research and Development Revenues**\n\nThe Company’s research and development revenues, where control transfers over time and revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, were $13,454,866 for the year ended December 30, 2023, and are described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes revenue for certain of its research and development contracts over time, generally measuring progress using the input (cost-to-cost) method as costs are incurred. Under the input method, revenue is recognized based on contract costs expended to date relative to total contract costs expected to be incurred. Management exercises significant judgment in determining revenue recognition for these customer contracts as the estimate of the total contract costs expected to be incurred is critical to the recognition of revenue based under the input method.\n\nWe identified the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition of research and development contracts, which are generally accounted for under the input method, to be a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions and judgments used by management in determining the estimated costs expected to be incurred throughout the customer contract. Auditing management’s estimation of cost to be incurred required significant audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the audit evidence obtained.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition of research and development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n●| Tested actual costs incurred, on a sample basis, and the mathematical accuracy of the costs included within the Company’s input (cost-to-cost) method.  \n---|---  \n●| Selected a sample of customer contracts and performed the following procedures:  \n---|---  \n–| Read the underlying contracts and agreed the Company’s total budgeted costs to approved management budgets.  \n---|---  \n–| Evaluated management’s ability to estimate progress towards completion by performing a review of contracts that were completed during the current year or spanned multiple years to determine the accuracy and precision of the Company’s estimation process.  \n---|---  \n–| Evaluated management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total profit by performing corroborating inquiries with Company personnel, including project managers, and comparing the estimates to actual subsequent results.   \n---|---  \n  \n_/s/ RSM US LLP_\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**KOPIN CORPORATION**\n\n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 5,710,685 | $| 8,258,878  \nRestricted cash | 500,000 | —  \nMarketable debt securities, at fair value | 11,692,000 | 4,388,778  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance of $1,025,000 and $303,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively | 9,706,036 | 6,537,891  \nContract assets and unbilled receivables | 3,409,809 | 4,068,364  \nInventory | 7,601,806 | 6,426,400  \nPrepaid taxes | 85,572 | 105,495  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 1,124,635 | 1,074,867  \nTotal current assets | 39,830,543 | 30,860,673  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | 2,163,417 | 1,831,641  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 2,504,909 | 3,168,520  \nOther assets | 124,925 | 170,132  \nEquity investments | 4,688,522 | 7,721,206  \nTotal assets | $| 49,312,316 | $| 43,752,172  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $| 7,076,759 | $| 5,438,980  \nAccrued payroll and expenses | 1,701,506 | 2,879,139  \nAccrued warranty | 2,160,000 | 1,966,000  \nContract liabilities and billings in excess of revenues earned | 916,826 | 930,500  \nOperating lease liabilities | 651,503 | 786,928  \nAccrued post-retirement benefits | 790,000 | 790,000  \nOther accrued liabilities | 1,702,681 | 1,182,346  \nCustomer deposits | 408,156 | —  \nDeferred tax liabilities | 470,884 | 482,739  \nTotal current liabilities | 15,878,315 | 14,456,632  \nNoncurrent contract liabilities and asset retirement obligations | 278,112 | 248,284  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion | 1,832,982 | 2,576,883  \nAccrued post-retirement benefits, net of current portion | 319,996 | 1,110,000  \nOther long-term liabilities, net of current portion | 1,494,016 | 1,369,758  \nTotal liabilities | 19,803,421 | 19,761,557  \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 11) | -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As used in these notes, the terms \"we,” \"us,” \"our,” \"Kopin” and the \"Company” mean Kopin Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.\n\n_Fiscal Year_\n\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 includes 52 weeks, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 includes 53 weeks, and the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 includes 52 weeks, and are referred to as fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, herein.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 include the accounts of Kopin Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kopin Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries and a majority owned 80% subsidiary, eMDT America, Inc., located in California (collectively the Company). In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 20% interest in eMDT America, Inc. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of which is allocated to the shareholders of the equity interests not owned by the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $19.7 million and $19.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million and $17.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company’s net cash outflows from operations were partially a result of funding its ongoing investments in research and development, which management believes will continue, production inefficiencies resulting from intermittent supply chain disruptions and litigation costs. Management has implemented certain plans to reduce cash outflows including operational improvements and the curtailment of certain development programs, both of which are expected to preserve cash. The litigation is discussed in Note 12. In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold 3.1 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $7.3 million. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, along with the net proceeds received in the first quarter of 2024 will be adequate to satisfy its current operating plans for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company has in the past sold equity securities through at-the-market equity offerings and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings. Nonetheless, management monitors the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If the Company’s actual results are less than projected or the Company needs to raise capital for additional liquidity, the Company may be required to do additional equity financings, reduce expenses, or enter into a strategic transaction. However, management can make no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s product and license and other revenues are derived from the sales of components and subassemblies and the license of intellectual property for use in defense and industrial applications. The Company also has development contracts for the design, manufacture and or modification of products for the U.S. Government or prime contractors for the U.S. Government and for customers that expect to sell into the defense markets. The Company may offer technologies developed under these defense research and development contracts in products sold to industrial, medical and consumer markets. The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR”) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer.\n\nThe Company’s fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government or other customers may result in revenue recognized in excess of amounts currently billed. The Company discloses the excess of revenues over amounts actually billed as Contract assets and unbilled receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. In some instances, the U.S. Government retains a small portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. The portion of the payments retained until the final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government and some commercial customers, the Company typically receives interim payments either as work progresses or by achieving certain milestones or based on a schedule in the contract. The Company recognizes a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned on the consolidated balance sheets. The advanced payment typically is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect the Company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For industrial and consumer purchase orders, the Company typically receives payments within 30 to 60 days of shipment of the product, although for some purchase orders, the Company may require an advanced payment prior to shipment of the product.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts with the same customer, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of the Company’s development contracts and contracts with the U.S. Government, the customer contracts with the Company to provide a significant service of integrating a set of components into a single unit. Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less frequently, however, the Company may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case the Company separates the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. In cases where the Company sells standard products, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\n\nFor certain contracts with the U.S. Government, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs because of continuous transfer of control to the customer and the lack of an alternative use for the product. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay the Company for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. For contracts with commercial customers, while the contract may have a similar liability clause, the Company’s products historically have an alternative use and thus, revenue is recognized at a point in time.\n\nIn situations where control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation for its contracts because the Company believes it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\n\nAccounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. The Company has to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by the Company’s subcontractors. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, the Company applies judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. If the Company’s estimate of total contract costs or its determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect, the Company’s revenue could be overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment.\n\nFor the Company’s commercial customers, revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer is satisfied and the Company transfers control of the products or services, which is generally upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is recorded as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Provisions for product returns and allowances are reductions in the transaction price and are recorded in the same period as the related revenues. The Company analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances. Certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products. Sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors’ customers and not for stocking inventory. Sales, value add and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe rights and benefits to the Company’s intellectual property are conveyed to certain customers through technology license agreements. These agreements may include other performance obligations including the sale of product to the customer. When the license is distinct from other obligations in the agreement, the Company treats the license and other performance obligations as separate performance obligations. Accordingly, the license is recognized at a point in time or over time based on the standalone selling price. The sale of materials is recognized at a point in time which occurs with the transfer of control of the Company’s products or services. In certain instances, the Company is entitled to sales-based royalties under license agreements. These sales-based royalties are recognized when they are earned. Revenues from sales-based royalties under license agreements are shown under License and other revenues on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Contract Assets_\n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized from customer arrangements, including licensing, exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. The Company classifies the noncurrent portion of contract assets under Other assets in its consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Contract Liabilities_\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized for the contract.\n\n_Performance Obligations_\n\nThe Company’s revenue recognition related to performance obligations that were satisfied at a point in time and over time were as follows:\n\nSchedule of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\n\nFiscal year ended | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nPoint in time | 34| % | 22| % | 31| %  \nOver time | 66| % | 78| % | 69| %  \n  \nThe value of remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ”)). As of December 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $25.9 million, which the Company expects to recognize revenue over the next 12 months. The remaining performance obligations represent amounts to be earned under government contracts, which are subject to cancellation.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Research and Development Costs_\n\nResearch and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display product development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. Research and development costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of experimental display products, and overhead, and are expensed immediately.\n\n_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n\nRestricted cash of approximately $0.5 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2023, and represents cash deposited by the Company into a separate account and designated as collateral for a standby letter of credit in the same amount in accordance with a contractual agreement with a vendor.\n\n_Marketable Debt Securities_\n\nMarketable debt securities consist primarily of commercial paper, medium-term corporate notes, and U.S. Government and agency-backed securities. The Company classifies these marketable debt securities as available-for-sale at fair value in \"Marketable debt securities, at fair value” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on marketable debt securities in the results of operations.\n\nThe Company uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining cost and calculating realized gains and losses with respect to marketable debt securities. The gross gains and losses realized related to sales and maturities of marketable debt securities were not material during the fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nFinancial instruments consist of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable and certain current liabilities. These assets (excluding marketable securities which are recorded at fair value) and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n_Inventory_\n\nInventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for the estimated difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Inventory write-downs are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.\n\nInventory consists of the following at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Inventory\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nRaw materials | $| 4,785,197 | $| 4,285,757  \nWork-in-process | 2,018,421 | 1,735,454  \nFinished goods | 798,188 | 405,189  \nTotal | $| 7,601,806 | $| 6,426,400  \n  \n55  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Property, Plant and Equipment_\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements and leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement or equipment. As discussed below, obligations for asset retirement are accrued at the time property, plant and equipment is initially purchased or as such obligations are generated from use.\n\n_Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities_\n\nThe Company periodically makes equity investments in private companies, accounted for as an equity investment, whose values are difficult to determine. The Company uses the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values which is often referred to as cost method investments. When assessing investments in private companies for impairment, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. Because these are private companies that the Company does not control, the Company may not be able to obtain all of the information the Company would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis. Accordingly, the Company’s estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date.\n\n_Product Warranty_\n\nThe Company generally sells products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to the Company’s products. The Company accrues for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and accrues for estimated incurred but unidentified issues based on historical activity.\n\n_Extended Warranties_\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from an extended warranty on the straight-line method over the life of the extended warranty, which is typically 12 to 18 months beyond the standard 12-month warranty. The Company classifies the current portion of extended warranties under Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned and the noncurrent portion of extended warranties under Noncurrent contract liabilities and asset retirement obligations in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company had approximately less than $10,000 of contract liabilities related to extended warranties at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n_Asset Retirement Obligations_\n\nThe Company recorded asset retirement obligations (\"ARO”) liabilities of $0.3 million and $0.2 million at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This represents the legal obligations associated with the retirement of the Company’s assets when the timing and/or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. Changes in ARO liabilities for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Changes in Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nBeginning balance | $| 242,094 | $| 267,970  \nExchange rate change | 12,586 | (25,876| )  \nEnding balance | $| 254,680 | $| 242,094  \n  \n56  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe 2017 Act imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (\"GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred.\n\n_Foreign Currency_\n\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated from the functional currency into U.S. dollars at year end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are accumulated as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains or losses are recognized in income or loss in the period in which they occur.\n\n_Net Loss Per Share_\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period less any unvested restricted shares. Diluted net loss per share is calculated using weighted-average shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares, less weighted-average shares reacquired during the period. The net outstanding shares are adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Company’s common stock equivalents, which consist of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock.\n\nThe following were not included in weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted because they are anti-dilutive:\n\nSchedule of Anti-dilutive Securities Excluded from Computation of Earnings Per Share\n\n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---  \nNonvested restricted common stock | 1,931,767 | 1,965,901 | 2,077,592  \n  \n_Concentration of Credit Risk_\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk other than marketable securities consist principally of trade accounts receivable. Trade receivables are primarily derived from sales to manufacturers of consumer electronic devices and wireless components or defense applications. The Company sells its products to customers worldwide and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains a reserve for potential credit losses.\n\nThe Company primarily invests its excess cash in government-backed and corporate debt securities that management believes to be of high creditworthiness, which bear lower levels of relative credit risk. The Company relies on rating agencies to ascertain the creditworthiness of its marketable securities and, where applicable, guarantees made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company.\n\n_Other-than-Temporary Impairments_\n\nThe Company conducts a review of its marketable debt securities on a quarterly basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI”). The Company assesses whether OTTI is present when the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if the Company intends to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; (2) if it is \"more likely than not” the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis.\n\n57  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe Company further estimates the amount of OTTI resulting from a decline in the creditworthiness of the issuer (credit-related OTTI) and the amount of non-credit-related OTTI. Non-credit-related OTTI can be caused by such factors as market illiquidity. Credit-related OTTI is recognized in earnings while non-credit-related OTTI on securities not expected to be sold is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not record any OTTI for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n_Stock-Based Compensation_\n\nThe fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is generally the quoted price of the Company’s equity shares on the date of grant. The nonvested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for periods ranging from one to five years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or market conditions. The performance criteria primarily consist of the achievement of established milestones. For nonvested restricted common stock awards which solely require the recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For nonvested restricted common stock awards which require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the service period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The Company recognizes compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for time vested awards.\n\n_Comprehensive Loss_\n\nComprehensive loss is the total of net (loss) income and all other non-owner changes in equity including such items as unrealized holding (losses) gains on marketable equity and debt securities classified as available-for-sale and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustment | Unrealized holding loss on marketable securities | Reclassifications of loss in net loss on marketable securities | Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  \n---|---|---|---  \nBalance as of December 26, 2020 | $| 1,162,506 | $| 385,447 | $| (63,519| ) | $| 1,484,434  \nChanges during year | (51,736| ) | (17,113| ) | (1,234| ) | (70,083| )  \nBalance as of December 25, 2021 | 1,110,770 | 368,334 | (64,753| ) | 1,414,351  \nChanges during year | (36,478| ) | (201,283| ) | (522| ) | (238,283| )  \nBalance as of December 31, 2022 | 1,074,292 | 167,051 | (65,275| ) | 1,176,068  \nChanges during year | 42,027 | 14,644 | (445| ) | 56,226  \nBalance as of December 30, 2023 | $| 1,116,319 | $| 181,695 | $| (65,720| ) | $| 1,232,294  \n  \n58  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_\n\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Examples of such triggering events applicable to the Company’s assets include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group, or adverse industry or economic trends. If any indicator of impairment exists, the Company would then assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of the asset group can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the Company would estimate the asset group’s fair value using future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset group and adjust the carrying value of the asset group accordingly. Given the Company’s history of negative operating losses and negative operating cash flows, the Company performed a quantitative test of its long-lived assets. Upon completion of its quantitative assessment as of December 30, 2023, the Company has concluded there was no impairment.\n\n_Leases_\n\nThe Company accounts for leases under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) _2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)_. The Company used the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allows it to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of right-of-use assets.\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains an embedded lease at inception. For lease arrangements with both lease and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), the Company accounts for the non-lease components separately.\n\nAll of the Company’s leases are operating leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and is reduced for any unrestricted incentives received at or before the commencement date.\n\nFor the majority of the Company’s leases, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date, as the implicit rate is not readily determinable. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term. For new or renewed leases, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.\n\nSome of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company includes these options in the recognition of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. In most cases, the Company has concluded that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain of being exercised by the Company (and thus not included in its Right of Use (\"ROU”) asset and lease liability) unless there is an economic, financial or business reason to do so. None of the Company’s leases include variable lease-related payments, such as escalation clauses based on the consumer price index (\"CPI”) rates or residual guarantees.\n\n59  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Following the release of ASU 2019-10 in November 2019, the new effective date, as long as the Company remains a smaller reporting company, would be annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2023 and there was not a material impact.\n\n**2. Property, Plant and Equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Property Plant and Equipment\n\nUseful Life | 2023 | 2022  \n---|---|---  \nEquipment | 3-5 years | $| 14,025,078 | $| 13,965,126  \nLeasehold improvements  | Life of the lease | 3,631,518 | 3,600,557  \nFurniture and fixtures | 3 years | 165,636 | 174,622  \nEquipment under construction | 957,915 | 550,219  \nProperty, plant and equipment, gross | 18,780,147 | 18,290,524  \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization | (16,616,730| ) | (16,458,883| )  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | $| 2,163,417 | $| 1,831,641  \n  \nDepreciation expense for fiscal year 2023 was approximately $0.6 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n**3. Leases**\n\nThe Company enters into operating leases primarily for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration and sales facilities, and information technology (\"IT”) equipment. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases. Almost all of the Company’s future lease commitments, and related lease liability, relate to the Company’s facility leases. Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company impaired its Operating lease right-of-use assets related to the Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. discussed in Note 5 Financial Instruments.\n\nSchedule of Lease Expense\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nOperating lease cost | $| 865,377 | $| 985,967  \n  \n60  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nAt December 30, 2023, the Company’s future lease payments under non-cancellable leases were as follows:\n\nSchedule of Future Lease Payment Under Non-cancellable Lease\n\n2024 | $| 795,884  \n---|---|---  \n2025 | 639,373  \n2026 | 604,000  \n2027 | 604,000  \n2028 | 201,333  \nThereafter | —  \nTotal future lease payments | 2,844,590  \nLess imputed interest | (360,105| )  \nTotal | $| 2,484,485  \n  \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n\nSchedule of Supplemental Information Related To Leases\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities | $| 983,289 | $| 993,633  \n  \nOther information related to leases was as follows:\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nWeighted Average Discount Rate—Operating Leases | 6.21| % | 5.94| %  \nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term—Operating Leases (in years) | 4.04 | 4.69  \n  \n**4. Contract Assets and Liabilities**\n\nNet contract assets (liabilities) consisted of the following:\n\nSchedule of Contract with Customer, Asset and Liability\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | $ Change | % Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nContract assets and unbilled receivables | $| 3,409,809 | $| 4,068,364 | $| (658,555| ) | (16| )%  \nContract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned | (916,826| ) | (930,500| ) | 13,674 | (1| )%  \nNoncurrent contract liabilities | (23,198| ) | (6,190| ) | (17,008| ) | 275| %  \nNet contract assets | $| 2,469,785 | $| 3,131,674 | $| (661,889| ) | (21| )%  \n  \n61  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe $0.7 million decrease in the Company’s net contract assets from December 31, 2022 to December 30, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in contract assets from the collection of amounts owed.\n\nThe Company recognized revenue of approximately $0.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.5 million related to its contract liabilities during the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company did not recognize impairment losses on its contract assets during the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021.\n\n**5. Financial Instruments**\n\n_Fair Value Measurements_\n\nFinancial instruments are categorized as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based upon the method by which their fair value is computed. An investment is categorized as Level 1 when its fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An investment is categorized as Level 2 if its fair market value is based on quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, or derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. An investment is categorized as Level 3 if its fair value is based on assumptions developed by the Company about what a market participant would use in pricing the assets.\n\nThe following table details the fair value measurements of the Company’s financial assets:\n\nSchedule of Fair Value Measurements of Financial Assets\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement at December 30, 2023 Using:  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 5,079,605 | $| 5,079,605 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | 4,474,375 | — | 4,474,375 | —  \nCertificates of deposit | 7,717,625 | 7,717,625 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 4,688,522 | 174,178 | — | 4,514,344  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 21,960,127 | $| 12,971,408 | $| 4,474,375 | $| 4,514,344  \n  \n62  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using:  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 5,933,386 | $| 5,933,386 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | 2,397,730 | — | 2,397,730 | —  \nCorporate debt | 1,500,445 | — | 1,500,445 | —  \nCertificates of deposit | 490,603 | 490,603 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 7,721,206 | 213,016 | — | 7,508,190  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 18,043,370 | $| 6,637,005 | $| 3,898,175 | $| 7,508,190  \n  \nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Initial measurement of equity investments occurs when an observable price for the equity investment is available. The Company adopted the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values (often referred to as cost method investments) on a prospective basis. As a result, these investments will be revalued upon occurrence of an observable price change for similar investments and for impairments. The Company has limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting and operations. The Company relies on the financial reporting provided by these investments in order to evaluate them for possible impairment. As a result, the Company faces certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments.\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with its Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. The technology license agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to LST if LST achieves certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. To the extent LST makes improvements to the technology licensed from Kopin, Kopin will receive a license for these improvements for certain markets. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to LST. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President and CEO and former Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is the Founder of LST. As a result of this transaction, in 2022 the Company wrote off the two operating lease assets associated with facilities used for the development of the Company’s organic light emitting diode (OLED) products. The Company has recorded its investment in LST at $0 as of December 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company has an equity interest in a company which it acquired through purchasing capital and contributing certain intellectual property totaling $3.9 million by December 26, 2020. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company reviewed the financial condition of its equity interest in the company and, as a result of valuing the investment through discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, recorded an impairment charge of $2.0 million to reduce the value of its investment. For the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company recorded approximately $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of unrealized losses on this equity investment, respectively, due to a fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate. As of December 30, 2023, the Company owned an approximate 10% interest in this investment and the carrying value of this equity investment was $1.5 million at December 30, 2023 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company has an investment in RealWear Inc. (RealWear) which had been reduced to $0 due to an impairment analysis. In the first quarter of 2022, RealWear raised additional equity capital and based on an observable price change of the customer’s share prices and terms of the equity sale, the Company remeasured the fair market value of its investment and recorded a gain of $4.7 million. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company made an additional equity investment of $0.5 million. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received shares valued at approximately $0.4 million as payment of royalties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity transaction, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the value of the investment to $2.5 million. As of December 30, 2023, the Company owned an approximate 3.3% interest in this investment.\n\n63  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nOn September 30, 2019 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Solos Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company sold and licensed certain assets of the Company’s SolosTM (\"Solos”) product line and WhisperTM Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction the Company received a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). The Company’s 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing. The Company will also receive a royalty in the single digits on the net sales amount of Solos products for a three-year period, after the commencement of commercial production. The Company has performed the analysis and identified Solos Technology as a variable interest entity that should not be consolidated by Kopin, as Kopin is not the primary beneficiary of the entity. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to Solos Inc., and its potential loss exposure is the value of the investment recorded on its books. Based on the price paid for equity by the other 80.0% owners of Solos Inc., volatility based on a peer group and assumptions about the risk-free interest rate, the Company estimated the fair value of its equity holdings at $0.6 million and in 2019 recorded a $0.6 million gain on its investment for this equity transaction as the basis of assets transferred was zero. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and other factors of the customer and, as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.2 million to reduce its investment in the customer to $0.2 million. The investment balance is $0.2 million as of December 30, 2023.\n\n_Marketable Debt Securities_\n\nThe Company’s corporate debt consists of floating rate notes with a maturity that is over multiple years but has interest rates that are reset every three months based on the then-current three-month London Interbank Offering Rate (\"three-month Libor”). The Company validates the fair market values of the financial instruments above by using discounted cash flow models, obtaining independent pricing of the securities or through the use of a model that incorporates the three-month Libor, the credit default swap rate of the issuer and the bid and ask price spread of the same or similar investments which are traded on several markets. The restricted cash balance at December 30, 2023 is invested in a certificate of deposit and is classified as a Corporate debt available-for-sale marketable debt security. Investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities are as follows at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Available-for-sale Marketable Debt Securities\n\nAmortized Cost | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value  \n---|---|---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | $| 4,500,030 | $| 2,500,006 | $| (25,655| ) | $| (102,276| ) | $| 4,474,375 | $| 2,397,730  \nCorporate debt | 7,750,174 | 2,000,012 | (32,549| ) | (8,964| ) | 7,717,625 | 1,991,048  \nTotal  | $| 12,250,204 | $| 4,500,018 | $| (58,204| ) | $| (111,240| ) | $| 12,192,000 | $| 4,388,778  \n  \nThe contractual maturity of the Company’s marketable debt securities is as follows at December 30, 2023:\n\nSchedule of Contractual Maturity\n\nLess than One year | One to Five years | Total  \n---|---|---  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | $| 2,989,195 | $| 1,485,180 | $| 4,474,375  \nCorporate debt | 4,240,445 | 3,477,180 | 7,717,625  \nTotal | $| 7,229,640 | $| 4,962,360 | $| 12,192,000  \n  \n**6. Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation**\n\n_Registered Sale of Equity Securities_\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company sold 2.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $16 million (average of $6.66 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.5 million pursuant to the Company’s At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated as of February 8, 2019 (the \"Previous ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, (\"Stifel”) as agent. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company sold 0.1 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.8 million (average of $6.74 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.1 million under the Previous ATM Agreement. The Previous ATM Agreement has since terminated pursuant to its terms as a result of the sale of all the shares subject to such agreement. On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a new At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Current ATM Agreement”) with Stifel under which the Company may sell up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company sold 0.6 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $4.8 million (average of $8.06 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.1 million under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company sold 1.5 million shares of common stock and 0.2 million shares of treasury stock for gross proceeds of $2.1 million (average of $1.26 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of less than $0.1 million and in the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold 675,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $0.9 million (average of $1.27 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of less than $0.1 million, pursuant to the Current ATM Agreement. The net proceeds from the sale of common shares were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the Company sold 17 million shares of registered common stock and issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $22.9 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.5 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. At December 30, 2023, the Company had available $41.4 million for sale of common stock under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\n_Sale of Treasury Stock_\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 126,389 shares of its common stock for approximately $0.2 million through the sale of shares under its At The Market Offering Agreement, dated March 5, 2021. Commissions paid were less than $10,000.\n\n64  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Restricted Stock Awards_\n\nIn 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Equity Plan”) which authorized the issuance of shares of common stock to employees, certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company, and non-employee members of the Board. The 2020 Equity Plan is a successor to the Company’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2010 Equity Plan”). The number of shares authorized under the 2020 Equity Plan was 4,000,000 shares of common stock, which has since been amended to authorize the issuance of 11,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, shares of common stock underlying any outstanding award granted under the 2010 Equity Plan that expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of such shares shall be available for the award of new Grants under this Plan. As of December 30, 2023, the Company has approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Equity Plan.\n\nThe fair value of non-vested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for periods ranging from one to five years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or the Company’s stock achieving a certain price. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that solely require the recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the anticipated service period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\n\nSchedule of Non-vested Restricted Stock Activity\n\nShares | Weighted Average Grant Fair Value  \n---|---  \nBalance at December 25, 2021 | 2,077,592 | $| 2.90  \nGranted | 1,013,600 | 1.33  \nForfeited | (444,350| ) | 2.45  \nVested | (680,941| ) | 2.82  \nBalance at December 31, 2022 | 1,965,901 | 2.22  \nGranted | 3,423,531 | 1.58  \nForfeited | (1,089,773| ) | 2.52  \nVested | (2,367,892| ) | 1.62  \nBalance at December 30, 2023 | 1,931,767 | $| 1.65  \n  \nOn December 31, 2020 (fiscal year 2021), the Company amended the employment agreement with its former CEO, and as part of the amendment issued five tranches of 188,000 shares of restricted stock grants. The Company used a Monte Carlo model to determine the estimated fair value of the awards. Total compensation expense resulting from the awards is approximately $2.1 million. The Company’s stock price met the required levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the total stock compensation expense was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

The total amount of the Company’s gross tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a ‘more likely than not’ threshold amounts to $0.4 million as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company’s policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to include these amounts as a component of income tax expense.

The Company has recognized a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets as the Company has concluded that such assets are not more likely than not to be realized.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. income taxes.\n\nUnder the provisions of Section 382, certain substantial changes in Kopin’s ownership may limit in the future the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be used annually to offset future taxable income and income tax liability.\n\nThe Company’s income tax returns have not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to examination for all years since 2002. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states.\n\nInternational jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to twenty years after filing of the respective return. Years still open to examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Korea (2011 onward), Japan (2011 onward), Hong Kong (2013 onward) and the United Kingdom (2016 onward). The Company is not currently under examination in these jurisdictions.\n\n**9. Accrued Warranty**\n\nThe Company warrants its products against defect for 12 months, however, for certain products a customer may purchase an extended warranty. A provision for estimated future costs and estimated returns for credit relating to such warranty is recorded in the period when product is shipped and revenue is recognized and is updated as additional information becomes available. The Company’s estimate of future costs to satisfy warranty obligations is based primarily on historical warranty expense experienced and a provision for potential future product failures. In 2022, the Company increased its warranty reserves due to quality issues. Changes in the accrued warranty for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Accrued Warranty\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 25, 2021  \n---|---|---  \nFiscal Year Ended  \nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 25, 2021  \nBeginning balance | $| 1,966,000 | $| 517,000 | $| 508,000  \nAdditions | 802,000 | 2,329,000 | 791,000  \nClaim and reversals | (608,000| ) | (880,000| ) | (782,000| )  \nEnding Balance | $| 2,160,000 | $| 1,966,000 | $| 517,000  \n  \n**10. Employee Benefit Plan**\n\nThe Company has an employee benefit plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In 2023, the plan allowed employees to defer an amount of their annual compensation up to a current maximum of $22,500 if they are under the age of 50 and $30,000 if they are over the age of 50. The Company matches 50% of all deferred compensation on the first 6% of each employee’s deferred compensation. The amount charged to operations in connection with this plan was approximately $0.3 million in fiscal year 2023 and $0.4 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n69  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n**11. Commitments**\n\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\n\n**12. Litigation**\n\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (\"the Court”), alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning an alleged joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleges that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications, and denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. Additional factual and expert discovery ordered by the Court has been completed. A trial date has been set by the Court for March 20, 2024. The Company has not concluded a loss from this matter is probable; therefore, the Company has not recorded an accrual for litigation or claims related to this matter as of December 30, 2023. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n**13.

In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies the Company needs to purchase from affiliates in order to enhance its product offering.\n\nThe Company and RealWear, Inc. (\"RealWear”) have entered into agreements where the Company has agreed to supply display modules to RealWear, and license certain intellectual property to RealWear. In conjunction with these agreements the Company received an equity interest in RealWear, one-time $1.5 million license fees and will receive royalties of future product sales. In May 2019, the Company signed an additional agreement to license certain intellectual property to Realwear for a $3.5 million license fee and additional sales-based royalties. Of the $3.5 million license fee, $2.5 million was paid upon signing of the license agreement and the other $1.0 million was paid in quarterly installments of $0.25 million. See Note 5 for a description of the Company’s investments in RealWear.

Pursuant to the Solos Purchase Agreement, the Company sold and licensed to Solos Technology certain assets of its SolosTM (\"Solos”) product line and WhisperTM Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction the Company received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology’s parent company, Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Solos Technology for sales support provided. Solos Technology has agreed to reimburse the Company for the employee’s time spent on Solos development.

Performance-based compensation includes cash payments and any other awards pursuant to any Company incentive plan made on or after January 1, 2009 where payment was predicated on achieving certain financial results. If the Board or an authorized committee determines that any such performance-based compensation would have been at a lower amount had it been based on the restated financial results, the Company will, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment from such officer of the portion of such performance-based compensation that is greater than that which would have been awarded or earned had such compensation been calculated on the basis of the restated financial results.\n"

We define microdisplays as displays that have a diagonal measurement of less than 2 inches. Our products are used for defense applications (thermal weapon rifle sights, fixed and rotary wing pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training & simulation headsets); industrial and medical headsets; and 3D optical inspection systems. We believe that the technologies we are developing may eventually be used in consumer augmented reality (\"AR”) and virtual reality (\"VR”) wearable headset systems. Our products are primarily used to overlay digital information on the real-world scene.\n\nAs part of our plan to focus our resources on new and existing defense, industrial and consumer applications that are in line with our strategic plan, in January 2023, we conducted a partial spinout of our organic light emitting diode (\"OLED”) development unit to Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (\"Lightning Silicon”). Lightning Silicon received a license under a Technology License agreement to certain Kopin intellectual property to develop, manufacture and sell OLED display technologies for use in the consumer market, based on 12 inch deposition technology development. The Technology License agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to Lightning Silicon if they achieve certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. We received an equity interest in Lightning Silicon and expect to receive royalties from the sale of products related to the licenses. We retained the ability and rights to develop, manufacture and sell OLED displays and complete optical solutions that include microdisplays to our core base in the defense and enterprise markets, as well as value added consumer applications. Lightning Silicon is a company formed by Dr. John C.C. Fan, our former Chairman of the Board, and former Chief Executive Officer, to develop and supply advanced OLED microdisplays for the consumer augmented reality and virtual reality markets.\n\nWe are transitioning from selling just displays to a solution that includes our display, optics, and drive electronics in a subassembly or a headset for the customer’s particular application. Our strategy is to focus on providing our defense, industrial and medical customers with application-specific optical solutions, which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. Our application-specific optical solutions are based on our proprietary microdisplay technologies, which include micro inorganic light emitting diode (\"MicroLED”), OLED, liquid crystal on silicon (\"LCOS”), and active-matrix liquid crystal displays (\"AMLCDs”) and various optics which may be our proprietary designs.\n\nOur primary sources of product revenues are from the sale of display and optical components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and development contracts primarily for U.S. defense programs. We believe we also are well-positioned with our technology, intellectual property, manufacturing capabilities and partnerships and reputation to take advantage of the emerging market for AR and VR applications and products of which microdisplays are the cornerstone technology. At the center of all our products is a microdisplay. We are the only company, to our knowledge, that offers AMLCDs, LCOS displays and OLED displays, and related optics, which enable us to serve the markets and customers based on their needs and the problems they are trying to solve. We are also in development to create MicroLED displays and displays with additional capabilities such as eye-tracking. We believe our display technologies, combined with our extensive expertise in optics, system electronics and human factors, are the reason why many customers come to us. In situations where a new market is developing, or the market already has a number of low-priced display offerings of the size and resolution needed, we may purchase displays from other display companies for use with our proprietary optics and or headset designs.\n\nThe components we offer for sale consist of our proprietary miniature or micro AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED display technologies, application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs”), backlights, and optical lenses. We refer to our AMLCD as \"CyberDisplay®,” our LCOS displays/Spatial Light Modulators (\"SLMs”) as \"Time Domain Imaging TM technology”, and our OLED displays as \"Lightning® displays”. Our transmissive AMLCDs are designed in Westborough, Massachusetts, have initial manufacturing steps performed in Taiwan and then are completed in our facility in Westborough, Massachusetts.\n\nOur AMLCD and OLED displays are sold separately or in subassemblies. For example, we offer a display as a single product, a display module which includes a display, an optical lens and backlight contained in either plastic or metal housings, a binocular display module which has two displays, lenses and backlights, and a higher-level assembly which has additional components for defense applications. Examples of products manufactured by our customers that include our AMLCD and OLED displays include:\n\n● | Weapon sights and target locators for soldiers to enable faster and more accurate target acquisition;  \n---|---  \n● | Weapon sight systems that support artificial intelligence (\"AI”) based targeting systems in tanks;  \n● | Fighter and helicopter pilot helmets that use our display to overlay information (targeting, flight operation, etc.);  \n● | Headsets and systems used by soldiers for training and simulation purposes;  \n● | Industrial headsets for applications such as field maintenance/service where a service worker can visually access diagrams and drawings in real time while keeping both hands free to conduct work or to access a remote expert with live video to help solve a problem remotely – thereby increasing productivity and effectiveness;  \n● | Medical headsets used by surgeons that include our displays so that the surgeon simply glances down to see the patient or glances up and sees a magnified image of the anatomy being worked on; and  \n● | AR consumer products for recreational use including rifle sights.  \n  \nOur LCOS products are designed and manufactured at our Forth Dimension Displays (\"FDD”) subsidiary in Dalgety Bay, Scotland. Our LCOS displays are often configured with drive electronics and sold as a package that makes it easier for our customers to design our displays into their end products. A significant portion of the LCOS displays are sold to customers for incorporation into SLMs, which are built into manufacturing equipment that are used for 3D optical measurement.\n\nWe are currently developing color and monochrome MicroLED displays and displays with additional capabilities.\n\nThe AMLCD display driver ASICs we offer are the electronic interfaces between our displays and the products into which the displays are incorporated. The optical lenses and backlights we offer are based on either our proprietary designs or designs we license from third parties. The ASICs, optical lenses, and backlights are manufactured by third parties.\n\nWe design and manufacture defense and industrial head-mounted and hand-held VR products for training and simulation. Our products allow customers to visualize and interact with simulated 3D environments and equipment for training purposes. Our customers develop high-fidelity training and simulation applications that require high-performance visuals, intuitive controls, and unsurpassed customer support.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nThe focus of our internally funded research and development activities is on our OLED, MicroLED and other display technologies. Previously we used internally funded research and development funds to design headset systems that were focused on the emerging industrial and consumer markets for head-worn, hands-free, voice-and gesture-controlled wireless computing and communication devices. We continue to license our previously designed systems under agreements that may include a royalty payable to us and a purchase and supply agreement that requires us to supply our customers and our customers to buy our components for integration into their products. The licenses may convey the right of exclusivity for a particular market or geographic area.\n\nIn addition to sales of our components, subassemblies, and headsets, we also derive a significant portion of our revenue from developing custom product solutions for our customers, which we refer to as Funded Research and Development. We enter into development agreements with the goal of successfully developing a customer product and then winning the production orders for such products once design is complete and tested. These development programs can take several years. The Funded Research and Development process typically adds to Kopin’s knowledge base and expertise, putting us in a better position for future business. The Funded Research and Development arrangements typically have various milestones we are required to achieve to be reimbursed for our efforts. These arrangements are normally fixed price and may be cancelled by the customer on short notice. We also believe that the technologies developed for the U.S. defense industry can eventually be used in commercial and enterprise applications and subsequently in consumer applications.\n\nSales to significant non-affiliated customers for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, as a percentage of total revenues, were as follows:\n\nSales as a Percent of Total Revenue  \n---  \nFiscal Year  \n2023 | **2022** | **2021**  \nCustomer  \nDefense Customers in Total | 56| % | 52| % | 40| %  \nDRS Network & Imaging Systems, LLC | 33| % | 40| % | 31| %  \nCollins Aerospace | 27| % | 28| % | 30| %  \nFunded Research and Development Contracts | 33| % | 30| % | 32| %  \n  \nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 25, 2021, are referred to herein as fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n**Augmented and Virtual Reality**\n\nWe believe that defense, industrial, and consumer companies are looking at AR and VR as new applications and computing platforms. For these markets to develop and grow, advances and investment in display technology, optics, application software, and wireless communications systems with greater bandwidth such as 5G networks will be necessary. These advances in display technologies must increase performance but at the same time the cost of displays must decrease.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**Our Solution**\n\n_Kopin Technology_\n\nKopin technology includes the ability to design, and in most cases, manufacture proprietary small form factor AMLCD, LCOS, OLED and MicroLED displays and optical lenses and the know-how to design and manufacture subassemblies and headsets based on our display technologies. We also offer proprietary backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. Our displays and optics are used in defense applications (thermal weapon rifle sights, pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training and simulation headsets), industrial applications (headsets for field service personnel), medical applications (surgeon’s headsets), or consumer applications (recreational rifle scopes). We also offer backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. The subassemblies we offer combine one or two of our displays, backlight, ASIC, complex optics, and other electronics in an assembly that is then included in a larger system (for example a weapon sight or a targeting system in an armored vehicle). These subassemblies must survive the shock and vibration of weapons fire and operate in extreme environmental conditions. The headsets we offer combine two of our displays, backlight, ASIC, complex optics, and other electronics in an assembly that is a stand-alone product that must interface with a larger system. The considerable know-how that goes into the design, materials selection, assembly, and testing of these subassemblies and headsets is an important part of our technology.\n\n_Display Products_\n\nSmall form factor displays used in near-eye applications are widely used in defense in many applications such as thermal weapon sights, avionic helmets and training and simulation systems. Small form factor near-eye displays currently have more limited use in industrial products such as wearable headsets that allow users to view data, schematics, and videos to enable them to perform production or repairs. In addition, we believe small form factor near-eye displays are well suited for AR and VR consumer markets and will be a critical component in the development of these markets, which we believe will grow in the coming years. We believe our small form factor displays have certain advantages with respect to small size, resolution, brightness, and low power consumption that are advantageous for product design and usage.\n\nThere are several microdisplay technologies commercially available including transmissive, reflective, and emissive. Our principal display products are miniature high-density color or monochrome AMLCDs that range from approximately 428 x 240 resolution to 2048 x 2048 (\"2K”) resolution and are sold in either a transmissive or reflective format. We offer emissive OLED displays with a resolution of 1280 x 720 (\"720p”), 2048 x 2048 2K, 1280 x 960 (\"QVGA”) and have demonstrated a 2560 x 2560 (\"2.6K”). We are developing emissive Light Emitting Diode (\"LED”) displays. We sell our displays individually or in combination with our other components assembled in a subassembly. For example, we offer a display as a product, an industrial subassembly unit that includes one or two displays, backlight and optics in a plastic housing, and a subassembly for defense applications that we refer to as an HLA (\"Higher-Level Assembly”) that contains a display, light emitting diode-based illumination, optics, and electronics in a sealed housing. The defense subassembly or HLA is designed specifically for the repetitive shock experienced in extreme environments and use.\n\nOur transmissive AMLCD products, which we refer to as CyberDisplay® products, utilize high-quality, single-crystal-on-silicon, which is the same high-quality silicon used in conventional integrated circuits. This single-crystal-on-silicon is not grown on glass; rather, it is first formed on a silicon wafer and patterned into an integrated circuit (including the active matrix, driver circuitry and other logic circuits) at an integrated circuit foundry. These processes enable the manufacture of miniature active-matrix circuits that are comparable to higher resolution displays relative to passive and other active matrix displays that are fabricated on glass. Our foundry partners fabricate integrated circuits using our proprietary backplane designs for our displays in their foundries in Taiwan. The fabricated wafers are then returned to our facilities, where we lift the integrated circuits off the silicon wafers and transfer them to glass using our proprietary Wafer Engineering technology. The transferred integrated circuits are then processed, packaged with liquid crystal, and assembled into display panels at our Westborough, Massachusetts facility. When combined with the appropriate optic, the display provides the user with a high-resolution, full-screen experience.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nOur proprietary technology enables the production of transparent circuits on a transparent substrate, in contrast to conventional silicon circuits, which are on an opaque substrate. Our CyberDisplay products’ imaging properties are a result of the inclusion of a liquid crystal layer between the active-matrix integrated circuit glass and the transparent cover glass. We believe our manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional active-matrix LCD manufacturing approaches, including:\n\n● | Greater miniaturization;  \n---|---  \n● | Higher pixel density;  \n● | Lower power consumption; and  \n● | Higher brightness.  \n  \nThe color CyberDisplay products generate colors by using color filters with a white backlight. Color filter technology is a process in which display pixels are patterned with materials, which selectively absorb or transmit the red, green, or blue colors of light.\n\nOur reflective LCOS display products are miniature high-density, dual mode color sequential/monochrome reflective microdisplays with resolutions that range from approximately 1280 x 768 pixels (\"WXGA”) resolution to 2K resolution. These displays are manufactured by our FDD subsidiary in Scotland. Our reflective displays are based on a proprietary, high-speed, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon (\"FLCOS”) platform. Our digital software and logic-based drive electronics combined with the very fast switching binary liquid crystal, enables our microdisplays to process images purely digitally and create red, green, and blue gray scale in the time domain. This architecture has major advantages in visual performance over other liquid crystal, organic light-emitting diode, and microelectromechanical systems-based technologies: precisely controlled full color or monochrome gray scale is achieved on a matrix of undivided high fill factor pixels, motion artifacts are reduced to an insignificant level, and there are no sub-pixels, no moving mirrors, and no analog conversions to detract from the quality of the image.\n\nThe FLCOS device is comprised of two substrates. The first is a pixelated silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (\"CMOS”) substrate which is manufactured by our foundry partner based on our proprietary backplane design using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. The silicon substrate forms the display’s backplane, serving as both the active matrix to drive individual pixels and as a reflective mirror. The second substrate is a front glass plate. Between the backplane and the front glass substrate is a ferroelectric liquid crystal material which, when switched, enables the incoming illumination to be modulated.\n\nOur OLED technology can emit light when electrical current flows through its electroluminescent layers as opposed to our AMLCD which requires a separate light source. Our OLED microdisplays have a top-emitting structure built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than on glass. An OLED display typically has a wider viewing angle than an AMLCD. Light from an OLED appears evenly distributed in the forward directions, and so a slight movement of the eye relative to the display does not perceive the change in the image brightness or color. OLED displays can also have a much higher contrast ratio than AMLCDs, which is desirable for some user applications.\n\nWe aim to disrupt the OLED microdisplays industry with a new fabless, scalable business model. We believe the partitioning of OLED manufacturing into multiple parties, each focusing on their core competencies, can make a significant difference in OLED microdisplays performance and supply chain, while reducing the capital cost and overhead costs of entering this business. Making OLED microdisplays involves three major steps: designing backplane circuits, processing silicon wafers to generate backplane wafers, and deposition of OLED layers on silicon backplane wafers and packaging the displays. We believe backplane design is the most intellectual property-intensive area. Kopin has more than 20 patents granted or pending on the design of OLED backplanes to get low power consumption, high frame rates, and more uniform display images. Kopin has established relationships with two silicon foundries to produce OLED backplane wafers. We believe Kopin’s Lightning® backplane technology and the emergence of high-volume OLED manufacturing facilities can reduce the cost of manufacturing OLED displays, thereby expanding the applications for OLED microdisplays.\n\nOur proprietary technology in OLED microdisplays lies mainly in the design of the integrated circuits or \"backplane” upon which OLED microdisplays are built. The backplane drives the performance of the display.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \nWe have engaged foundry services for the fabrication of the Lightning® OLED backplane wafers. Our model is to sell these wafers to foundries that deposit the organic material on the backplane and manufacture the displays. The deposition foundries will either sell the displays to their customers or to us for resale to our customers. We believe this outsourcing model allows us to leverage our underlying backplane intellectual property as well as the existing infrastructure to obtain lower cost manufacturing and avail ourselves of manufacturing technology improvements as they occur.\n\nCurrently we have several OLED microdisplays including a 2K display with 2048 x 2048 resolution in a 0.99” diagonal size, which are aimed at VR and Mixed Reality applications; and a 720p display with 1280 x 720 resolution in a 0.49” diagonal size, which is aimed at AR applications. We have also demonstrated a 2.6K x 2.6K with 2560 x 2560 resolution in a 1.3” diagonal display, which is aimed at VR applications, and a QVGA display with 1280 x 960 resolution in a 0.5” diagonal size, which is aimed at electronic viewfinder and AR applications. Our OLED microdisplays have a combo C-PHY/D-PHY Mobile Industry Processor Interface and display stream compression to allow 120 Hz operation at full resolution. This display is designed for high-end VR and content streaming applications.\n\nWe offer MicroLED microdisplays which offer the possibility of high brightness, wide viewing angle, excellent contrast, and low cost. Like our OLED strategy, Kopin’s approach is to design the backplane and use foundry partners for the production of the displays. Kopin is working with potential customers to explore the potential benefits and implementation of the technology. Currently MicroLEDs are expensive to manufacture, in order to make them commercially viable we expect that high-volume manufacturing process development may be required, including the development of equipment.\n\nBy offering transmissive, reflective, and emissive microdisplays technologies today and working with potential customers for MicroLEDs in the future, we believe we can uniquely support whichever technology is best suited for a given application. Transmissive and reflective AMLCDs are typically used in bright light conditions as their brightness can be modulated over a wide range by controlling the backlight operation. OLED displays currently have less brightness range but offer superior contrast and response time characteristics and therefore are better suited in an immersive products environment that blocks out ambient light. MicroLEDs hold the promise of brightness, high contrast, superior response time and low cost.\n\n_Optical Lenses and Backlights_\n\nWe offer a variety of optical lenses, some of which we have developed internally and others for which we license the rights to sell. We also offer a variety of backlights, some of which we have developed internally and some of which are \"off-the-shelf” components. The lenses come in a variety of sizes with the smallest being our Pupil™, followed by our Pearl™ and Pancake™ lenses. The different sizes of lenses give us and our customers design flexibility when creating headset systems. There is a trade-off between the lens size and the size of the perceived image to the viewer. For example, a Pearl™ lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking directly at a smartphone, whereas a Pancake™ lens will provide the viewer with an immersive experience. We use third parties to manufacture these lenses.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n_Headset Systems_\n\nWe license a wireless industrial headset reference design to customers that is a head-worn computer that connects to the Internet wirelessly and includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a microprocessor, battery, camera, memory, and various commercially available software packages that we license. We also licensed an industrial headset reference design that attaches to a pair of safety glasses, includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a camera, is operated primarily using voice and is tethered to an information source, such as a smartphone, via a wire. The display module or optical pod allows users to view information such as maintenance diagrams and instruction sets, Internet data, emails, text messages, maps, or other data at a \"normal” size because of our specialized optics. Our industrial headsets provide the capability of viewing technical diagrams, by enabling the user to zoom in to see finer details or zoom out to see a larger perspective. We are also developing a headset for the medical market.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nOur product strategy is to enter Funded Research and Development programs with U.S. defense prime contractors to invent, develop, manufacture, and sell (or license) leading-edge critical technology and microdisplays components and subassemblies that will be used in rugged environments. We intend to use the know-how gained and technology developed from these defense development programs and products to create products that can be used in industrial, enterprise, medical and ultimately consumer applications. The products we develop typically include a microdisplay, optics, and an ASIC in a sealed housing. The products we make for the defense market must be able to withstand the extreme shock and vibration experienced in weapons fire. Accordingly, our intellectual property includes not just our patented microdisplays and a broad range of optics but also our know-how to manufacture products that can withstand the shock and vibration of weapons fire and extreme environments. The critical elements of our strategy include:\n\n● | _Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property._ We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets and we have been accumulating a significant patent and know-how portfolio either by internal efforts or through acquisition. We own, exclusively license, or have the exclusive right to sublicense approximately 200 patents and patent applications issued and/or pending worldwide. An important piece of our strategy is to continue to accumulate valuable patented and non-patented technical know-how relating to our microdisplays, including backplane design, optics and other critical technologies for subassemblies and headsets.  \n---|---  \n● | _Maintain Our Technological Leadership in Defense and Industrial Markets._ We are a recognized leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-resolution microdisplay components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications. We believe our ability to continue to develop components and subassemblies for defense applications enhances our opportunity to grow within our other non-defense targeted markets such as industrial, medical, and eventually AR and VR consumer markets. We perform research and development contracts for U.S. Government agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government. Under these contracts, the U.S. Government funds all or a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation microdisplays, related technologies and products for aviation systems such as pilot helmets, soldier-centric systems such as rifle weapon sights, training and simulation systems and armored vehicles. This enables us to supplement our internal research and development budget with additional funding and adds to our expertise in technology, products, and systems.  \n● | _Understand Our Customers’ Needs._ We believe our system know-how, be it a defense, industrial or consumer system, is a compelling reason why customers choose Kopin as their supplier. Unlike many of our competitors who only offer a display, we offer a range of display technologies, optics, backlights, and ASICs as either an individual component or in a system. We believe this enables us to provide superior technology solutions for our customers’ needs. Additionally, our human-factors and system understanding enables us to offer our customers valuable engineering services to solve their issues and reduce time to market for their products.  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \n● | _Internally Manufactured Products and Use of Third-Party Manufacturing._ We design and manufacture our transmissive and reflective display products in facilities that we lease and manage. However, the initial manufacturing steps for fabricating the silicon wafers are performed at capital-intensive Taiwan foundries. With OLED displays, which we design the critical backplane, we use silicon wafer foundries to produce our electronic wafers based on our backplane designs, and then we use OLED deposition foundries to perform the OLED deposition steps on the electronic wafers to produce our displays. The use of these third-party foundries reduces our investments in plant and equipment and working capital for new products and enables us to update designs as technology and manufacturing trends change.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Markets and Customers**\n\nOur business model is to primarily generate product revenues by selling display components, subassemblies and headsets to customers who offer defense, industrial, or medical products and to a lesser extent license our system designs and know-how. Eventually we believe our technologies can generate revenues in the consumer AR and VR markets if we successfully develop differentiated products at an acceptable price point. We also enter development contracts from customers to either design custom products for them or help them integrate our technology into their products (Funded Research and Development).\n\nWe currently sell our display products to our customers in various configurations including but not limited to a single display component, a subassembly that includes a display, optic, backlight and focus mechanism and electronics, a binocular display subassembly that includes two displays, lenses, and backlights, and as a subassembly (also known as an HLA) for defense customers. An HLA is like a module but includes additional components such as an eye cup specific to a defense application and is designed for extreme shock, vibration and hostile environments.\n\nWe have sold our AMLCD products to Collins Aerospace, Elbit, and DRS RSTA Inc. for use in defense applications, and to RealWear and Iristik for industrial wearable products. We have sold our LCOS display products to Saki, Jutze and Mirtec for use in 3D optical inspection equipment. Our revenues from our OLED and MicroLED displays have primarily been from development contracts with customers that are designing our displays into their products.\n\nFor our AMLCD display products to function properly in their intended applications, ASICs and backlights are generally required. Several companies have designed ASICs to work with our display products and our customers can procure these chip sets directly from the manufacturer or through us.\n\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, sales to defense customers, excluding research and development contracts, as a percentage of total revenue were 56%, 52% and 40%, respectively. For fiscal year 2023, Collins Aerospace and DRS Network & Imaging Systems LLC accounted for approximately 27% and 33% of our revenues, respectively.\n\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development revenues, primarily from multiple contracts with various prime contractors of U.S. Government agencies, accounted for approximately 33%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues.\n\n**Product Development**\n\nWe believe that continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with our customers to continue our product development efforts. Our primary internal development efforts are focused on AMLCD display subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and OLED display components for defense, industrial and medical applications. Our customer funded development efforts are primarily focused on MicroLED display development.\n\nWe have also begun developing software defined backplanes which support Artificial Intelligence focused on solving specific use cases in the Defense and Consumer markets called our NeuralDisplay™ product line.\n\n_Component Products and Subassemblies_\n\nThe pixel size of our current AMLCD transmissive display products ranges from 6.8 to 15 microns. These pixel sizes are much smaller than a pixel size of approximately 100 microns in a typical laptop computer display. The resolutions of our current commercially available AMLCD display products are 428 x 240, 640 x 360, 640 x 480, 854 x 480, 800 x 600, 1,280 x 720 and 1,280 x 1,024 and 2048 x 2048 pixels. The pixel size of our current reflective display products ranges from 8.2 to 13.6 microns. The resolutions of our current commercially available reflective display products are 1,280 x 768, 1,280 x 1,024, 2,048 x 1,536, and 2,048 x 2,048 pixels.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nOur AMLCD display product development efforts are primarily focused on improving performance and reducing manufacturing costs. We are continually evaluating our display manufacturing process to reduce costs. Our defense products include subassemblies, and our defense subassemblies are referred to as HLAs. The HLA may include a display and multiple optical lenses in a hermetically sealed housing. The HLAs are made to very exact tolerances, which require Kopin to manage its supply chain to procure raw materials that meet specification while enabling Kopin to achieve high yields.\n\nOur LCOS display product development efforts are also primarily focused on improving performance and reducing manufacturing costs. Our LCOS displays are offered with resolutions that range from approximately 1280 x 768 pixels (\"WXGA”) resolution to 2K resolution.\n\nThe pixel size of our current OLED displays ranges from 7.8 to 9.2 microns with resolutions of 1,280 x 720, 2,048 x 2,048 and 2,560 x 2,560. We have only recently commenced offering OLED displays and therefore our OLED products are much less mature than our AMLCD products. Our MicroLED products are still in the development stage.\n\nWe offer components such as our optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs, manufactured to our specifications, which we then buy and resell. The components that are made to order rely on either intellectual property we developed or acquired or that we license from third parties.\n\n**Funded Research and Development**\n\nWe have entered various development contracts with agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. These contracts help support the continued development of our core technologies. We intend to continue to pursue development contracts for applications that relate to our defense and commercial product applications. Our contracts contain certain milestones relating to technology development and may be terminated prior to completion of funding. Our customer funded development projects often lead to a product or component supply agreement. Our policy is to retain our proprietary rights with respect to the principal commercial applications of our technology, however, we are not always able to retain our proprietary rights. To the extent technology development has been funded by a U.S. federal agency, under applicable U.S. federal laws the federal agency that provided the funding has the right to obtain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, fully paid license to practice or have practiced this technology for governmental use. In addition, we may be required to negotiate intellectual property rights with our defense prime contractors. For our commercial development agreements, customers often obtain exclusive rights to a particular display or technology that is developed either permanently or for some period. Revenues attributable to research and development contracts for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 totaled $13.5 million, $14.4 million and $14.7 million, respectively.\n\n**Competition**\n\nKopin’s strategy is to focus on providing our customers with application specific optical solutions which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. We offer display technologies, from our portfolio of display technologies (MicroLED, OLED, LCOS and AMLCD), with specific optical designs, and drive electronics in a subassembly for the customer’s particular application. Typically, our product offerings provide a digital image which is overlayed on the analog world.\n\nThe general commercial display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large Asian-based electronics companies, including AUO, BOE Technology Group, Himax, LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Texas Instruments. In addition, several companies focus on OLED microdisplays including BOE Technology Group, Lakeside, MicroOLED, Olightek, Seeya, Seiko Epson and Sony. The display market consists of multiple segments, each focusing on different end-user applications applying different technologies. Competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics, product quality, size, and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. The success of our display product offerings will also depend upon the adoption of our display products by customers as an alternative to other active-matrix LCDs or OLEDs and upon our ability to compete against other types of well-established display products and new emerging display products. Particularly significant is a user’s willingness to use a near-eye display device, as opposed to a direct-view display that may be viewed from several inches to several feet. Assuming a user is willing to use a near-eye display device, companies such as Apple, Meta, and Samsung are offering near-eye virtual reality headset products that use large display panels on glass to provide the image as opposed to using microdisplays. Displays on glass typically have lower resolution than our products but are lower in cost on a per square inch basis. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against these companies and technologies, or that consumers will accept the use of such eyewear in general or our customers’ product form factor specifically.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nThere are also several AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED and alternative display technologies in development and production. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or are developing products based on these technologies. We outsource the manufacturing of our OLED displays to Chinese and European foundries. We expect these foundries to offer their own products. Our display products will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies.\n\nThere are many companies whose sole business is the development and manufacture of optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs. These companies may have significantly more intellectual property and experience than we do in the design and development of these components. We do not manufacture optical lenses, backlights, or ASICs but we either have them made to our specifications or buy standard off-the-shelf products.\n\n**Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses**\n\nAn important part of our product development strategy is to seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology using various U.S. and foreign patents and contractual arrangements. We intend to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively. Many of our U.S. patents and applications have counterpart foreign patents, foreign patent applications or international patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty.\n\n**Human Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, our consolidated business employed 144 individuals. Of these employees, 3 hold Ph.D. degrees in Material Science, Electrical Engineering or Physics. Our management and professional employees have significant prior experience in semiconductor materials, device transistor and display processing, optical design, manufacturing, and other related technologies. Our employees are in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the laws regarding employee relationships are different by jurisdiction. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have policies to prevent discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. We take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national origin. We also take affirmative action to employ and advance veterans in employment. We consider relations with our employees to be good.\n\nIn 2004, we finalized and adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics regarding the standards of conduct of our directors, officers and employees. The code is reviewed and updated periodically by our Board of Directors and is available on our website at www.kopin.com.\n\n**Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Initiatives**\n\nWe strive to create and maintain a working environment that fosters honesty and hard work and rewards all of our employees’ hard work. We endeavor to make Kopin Corporation a place people are proud to be associated with. With the growing awareness of environmental and social issues, we are in the process of creating a more formalized ESG strategy. Our initial process for the strategy creation includes work by a cross-functional ESG team of leaders representing operations, human resources, supply chain, finance, marketing, and facilities departments. We also utilize third-party facility, environmental and legal consulting services. These third-party consultants are assisting us in creating an ESG materiality assessment from which we can develop a baseline assessment for monitoring our progress. Our progress in creating our ESG strategy and other related activities are reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nWe provide recurring company-wide communication of our formalized values, a summary of which are:\n\nIntegrity | Team | Customers  \n---|---|---  \nUphold Ethical Standards in Our Performance | Treat Everyone with Respect | Highest Quality Customer Service Through Collaborative Success  \nKeep Our Commitments | Encourage Open Communication | Provide Industry Leading Products  \nProtect Our Intellectual Property | Promote Critical Thinking and Innovation | Maintain Confidentiality and Protect Customer Intellectual Property  \n  \nWe are not a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (\"RBA”); however, we have utilized the themes of the RBA Code of Conduct to supplement our Code of Ethics, including the RBA Code of Conduct’s five critical areas of corporate social responsibility: labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. We believe that by following the values noted above and doing our part in each of these areas, we can achieve our business objectives and long-term stockholder value. For additional information, see \"Item 1 – Business: Human Capital Resources” in this Form 10-K.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_We strive to create a workplace based on the following principles and goals:_\n\n_Care for Our People_\n\n● We believe in upholding the principles of human rights, worker safety, and observing fair labor practices within our organization.\n\n● We respect different viewpoints and perspectives, and ultimately individual thoughts create innovation and achieve better results. We continually evaluate how we provide organizational training, formalize company values, and revitalize recruitment strategy.\n\n● We are committed to employee safety. We have installed safety protocols and monitoring systems. We have periodic audits by third parties to test our systems and perform preventive maintenance. Our policies prohibit an employee from being alone in our production facilities or in unsupervised areas of our facilities.\n\n_Environmental Responsibility_\n\n● We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We maintain an environmental management system and a specific framework for implementing relevant sustainable practices.\n\n● We ask our employees to help us contribute towards environmental sustainability by looking for opportunities to conserve energy, reduce consumption of natural resources, preserve air and water quality, manage waste properly, reuse and recycle, and reduce the use of toxic substances in our operations where possible, including, in particular, in our clean room and lab facilities. Our clean room facility emissions are less than permitting and reporting thresholds, and we track emissions monthly to verify compliance with the regulations.\n\n● We look for ways to reduce energy consumption in our facilities around the world, including upgrades and/or retrofits to smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. For instance, we have installed variable speed fans, which only turn on based on various metrics, thereby reducing energy usage.\n\n_Ethics & Corporate Responsibility_\n\n● We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance and embracing diversity and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization.\n\n● We are committed to observing fair, transparent, and accountable operating practices.\n\n● We seek to create and foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we promote an ethical organizational culture and encourage all employees to raise questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues and company policies and to offer suggestions about how we can make our organization better. We have a Whistleblower Ethics Hotline that includes global telephone access and online access. We have an independent third party periodically test the Whistleblower Ethics Hotline.\n\n_Supply Chain Responsibility_\n\n● We intend to request that our suppliers adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent by flowing this requirement through our commercial contracts.\n\n● We also adhere to Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act and support efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, we adopted the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seek to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from our suppliers each year, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. We do not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (collectively referred to as 3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and we are in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Government Regulations**\n\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including but not limited to branches of the Department of Defense (\"DoD”).\n\nU.S. defense contractors are among our largest customers, representing a substantial majority of our total revenues. The U.S. Government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either \"for convenience” (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and possibly profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations including the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production or cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Certain chemicals we import are subject to regulation by the U.S. Government. If we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable laws, we could be subject to adverse government actions and may not be able to import critical supplies.\n\nWe are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR”) laws which regulate the protection (cybersecurity) and export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use such data or products for defense purposes. Cybersecurity and data security and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products, or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nWe are also subject to federal importation laws that regulate the importation of raw materials and equipment from other nations that are used in our products. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations.\n\n**Investments in Related Businesses**\n\nOn September 30, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Solos Technology Limited (\"Solos Technology”), pursuant to which we sold and licensed certain assets of our Solos product line and Whisper Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction, we received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology’s parent company, Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). Our 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing after which we will need to participate in future equity offerings, or our ownership percentage will be diluted.\n\nWe acquired an equity interest in Lenovo New Vision in the first quarter of 2018 for $1.0 million and the contribution of certain intellectual property. As of December 30, 2023, we own approximately 10% interest in this investment and the carrying value of our investment is $1.5 million.\n\nWe acquired a right to an equity interest in a medical device company in 2021. As of December 30, 2023, the carrying value of this investment is $0.3 million.\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, we own 100% of the outstanding common stock of NVIS, Inc (\"NVIS”), FDD, and e-MDT America Inc. (\"eMDT”) and we consolidate each of their financial results within our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe terminated operations of our subsidiary, Kopin Software Ltd., in the third quarter of 2019 and are in the process of liquidating it.\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with our Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Technology License agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to Lightning Silicon if they achieve certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President, CEO and Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer, terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is also the founder of LST.\n\nWe may from time to time make further equity investments in these and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of our business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies we need to invest in to enhance our product offering. These investments may not provide us with any financial return or other benefit, and any losses by these companies or associated losses in our investments may negatively impact our operating results.\n\n**Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components**\n\nWe rely on third-party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets, backlights and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers and chemicals. In addition, our CyberDisplay subassemblies, HLAs, binocular display modules, and other modules include lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components that we purchase from third-party suppliers. Some of these third-party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, our defense customers typically buy a small number of units, which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. As a result, we are highly dependent on a select number of third-party contractors and suppliers.\n\n**Availability of Information**\n\nWe make available free of charge through our website, www.kopin.com, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished, as well as certain of our corporate governance policies, including the charters for the Board of Directors’ audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees and our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and whistleblower policy. We will also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of any of the foregoing materials. Any such request must be made in writing to us, c/o Investor Relations, Kopin Corporation, 125 North Drive, Westborough, MA, 01581.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1A.** | **_Risk Factors_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. Accordingly, our business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe to be material may also negatively affect our business and financial results. The risk factors set forth below describe what we believe to be the material risks and uncertainties related to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position. We have included the risk factors below without any reflection on the relative importance of, or likelihood of, any particular risk factor.\n\n_We have experienced a history of losses, have a significant accumulated deficit, have had negative cash flow from operating activities in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, and expect to have negative cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year 2024_. Since inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. As of December 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $358.2 million. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $17.9 million and $12.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and marketable debt securities, respectively. For the years 2023 and 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $15.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively. The increase in our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily due to gross proceeds of $22.9 million received from the sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per share. We plan to continue to invest in research and development even during periods when we are not profitable, which may result in our incurring losses from operations and negative cash flow. If we do not soon achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability, our financial condition will ultimately be materially and adversely affected, and we will be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to raise any necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\n\n_Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others._ Companies in the display industry steadfastly pursue and protect their intellectual property rights. This has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity and enforceability of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. In the event that our products might infringe upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be notified, from time to time, that we could be or we are infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If we are forced to defend against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there are one or more successful claims of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease the manufacture, use, importation and/or sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to patents of third parties covering the infringing technology or using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, our business could be adversely affected. We are currently involved in an intellectual property dispute with Blue Radios, Inc., as described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. If the outcome of such a dispute is adverse to us, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that licenses will be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that damages for infringement will not be assessed or that further litigation will not occur. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of any such claims or any adverse decision or ruling relating to such litigation, including the Blue Radios litigation, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or conduct our business as we presently conduct it and as we plan to conduct it in the future.\n\n_We may be unable to manufacture our products cost effectively to meet contractual specifications or customer requirements._ Our products are required to meet specifications agreed to in purchase orders and related agreements with our customers. Our ability to produce products which meet these specifications is dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to our manufacturing processes and our vendors providing raw materials that meet the specifications we have agreed to with them. In addition, while there may be agreement with our customers on the specifications there may be ambiguity with the method to measure compliance with meeting the specifications. When we commence production of new products, we normally go through a period of low production efficiency as we modify our production processes for higher volume output and train more production employees on how to make the product. Low production efficiency means that the cost to make the product is more than what we anticipated when we accepted the purchase order from the customer. In addition, after we commence selling our products customers may request changes to the products which may also result in the low production efficiency starting again. We currently have several new products and new product configurations going to production. If the products we deliver are found to have undetected defects or latent defects when we ship them, we may incur the cost to recall the products. Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as other harm to our business. If we are unable to manufacture our products cost effectively, our revenue and ability to obtain profitability will be adversely affected.\n\n_Our revenues and cash flows could be negatively affected if sales of our display products for defense applications significantly decline or the current defense development programs are either cancelled or ultimately do not result in future product sales._ The sale of our display products to the military for use in thermal weapon sights and avionic helmets has been a primary source of our defense revenues and cash flows over the last several years. We currently are included in the Family Weapon Sight (\"FWS”) Individual program and the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) jet fighter program. In 2023 we experienced quality issues with the products we supplied for the FWS-I program. These quality issues resulted in suspension of shipments to our customer at various times during 2023 as we made modifications to our production processes. We are continuing to make modifications to our production processes as we resolve certain issues. We are in development and qualification of additional defense programs related to avionic helmets, armored vehicles and soldier rifle scopes. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military and our customers depends on our Display products remaining qualified in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, FWS and other U.S. defense programs, our customers continuing to serve as the suppliers for those programs, and on the U.S. Government/military funding these programs. We may not be awarded contracts for the systems we are in qualification for, and for the systems we are qualified for, we may only be awarded a portion of the program as the U.S. military looks to have multiple sources when possible. Even if our products qualify for these programs, the U.S. Government can opt to change suppliers, in which case demand for our products could be negatively affected. In addition, the government could postpone or cancel these programs. We believe the DoD is evaluating alternative display technologies for the F-35 Strike Fighter program and other defense programs, and we will need to develop and qualify any replacement display technologies. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military also depends on winning contracts over our competitors. If we are unable to be qualified into new U.S. defense programs, remain qualified in existing programs, or win orders against our competition, or if defense programs are not funded, then our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flow will be materially and negatively impacted.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n_Our investments in the development and sale of OLED microdisplays may not be successful, which may materially adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flow._ Historically, we have sold products that incorporate our proprietary AMLCDs. We believe that for certain applications OLED microdisplays have performance advantages and we have received future display product needs from some customers that plan to switch from AMCLDs to OLED microdisplays in the next two to three years. We are in the process of designing and developing OLED microdisplays and establishing foundry relationships to manufacture them. We expect to make additional monetary investments in their commercialization, though our plan is to outsource their production. We have little experience in production outsourcing. If we are unsuccessful in designing and developing OLED microdisplays or if we are unable to find cost-effective third-party production partners, our sales and profitability may be negatively affected.\n\n_Supply shortages have and could continue to impair the quality, reduce the availability or increase the cost of raw materials, which could harm our business._ We rely on third-party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets, backlights, and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers, and chemicals. Lead times for the parts and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as manufacturing cycle times, manufacturing yields, and the availability of raw materials used to produce the parts or components. The semiconductor industry has been and continues to experience a shortage of semiconductor components. We have experienced intermittent shortages of raw materials, which has affected our ability to manufacture and ship units. These shortages have also resulted in an increase in the cost of raw materials and semiconductor components. Our products sold for defense applications go through an expensive and long qualification period before the government will accept the products. Once the product for a defense application is accepted there are restrictions on our ability to substitute a different raw material or component for the one used in the qualification of the product. If these shortages were to further affect our supply of raw materials, our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could continue to be adversely affected, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n_Geopolitical tensions and any conflicts resulting therefrom may negatively affect our ability to source materials and components required to manufacture our products._ We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our AMLCD defense display products. We use a Chinese foundry for the deposition process in creating our OLED displays. Our reliance on these foundries involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. Geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan or China-U.S. relations could disrupt these foundries’ operations and cause these risks to materialize, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture our display products. If these foundries were to become unable to provide the required capacity, services or quality on a timely basis due to a military or other form of conflict, geopolitical tensions, or other reasons relating thereto, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our display products, or we may be forced to manufacture them in limited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms or at all.\n\n_We are in the process of transitioning from using a Chinese deposition foundry to a European foundry for certain OLED products for defense applications._ We depend principally on a Chinese foundry for the deposition process in creating our OLED displays but we are in the process of having the deposition process performed by a European foundry. If we are unsuccessful in executing our transition plan or if the transition is significantly delayed, our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could continue to be adversely affected, which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n_Most of our defense sales are on a fixed-price basis, which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns._ Under a fixed-price contract, we receive only the amount indicated in the contract, regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates that we use to calculate the sales price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, we could incur losses. We have had situations where we have underestimated the cost of a program and incurred losses in fulfilling the contract. As discussed above, we are seeing a global shortage of semiconductors and other raw materials which is resulting in a significant increase in some raw material prices. In addition, the U.S. is experiencing inflation levels not seen in many years which is driving higher labor costs. Some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, scheduling, and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then our cost to perform the work could increase, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Some of the contracts we bid on have Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (\"IDIQ”) provisions. This means we are bidding a fixed price but are not assured of the quantity the government will buy or when it will buy during the term of the contract. This means we are exposed to the risk of price increases for labor, overhead and raw materials during the term of the contract. We may incur losses on fixed-price and IDIQ contracts that we had expected to be profitable, or such contracts may be less profitable than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n_The widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._ We could be negatively affected by the widespread outbreak of an illness, communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the economy on a global, national, and local level, disrupted global supply chains, and created volatility and disruption of financial markets. Responses from governmental authorities and companies to reduce the spread of the pandemic affected economic activity through various containment measures including, among others, business closures, work stoppages, quarantine and work-from-home guidelines, limiting capacity at public spaces and events, vaccination requirements, or restrictions of global and regional travel.\n\n_We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult._ We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase orders with shipment schedules within one year, and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled before shipment without significant penalty. As a result, our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time, which makes forecasting our revenues difficult. In addition, due to the absence of a substantial non-cancelable backlog, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels and the amounts we invest in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n_Fluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could adversely affect the price of our common stock._ Our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons, including:\n\n● | The timing of the initial selection of our display products as components in our customers’ new products;  \n---|---  \n● | Availability of interface electronics for our display products;  \n● | Competitive pressures on selling prices of our products;  \n● | The timing and cancellation of customer orders;  \n● | Our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis;  \n● | Our ability to successfully reduce costs;  \n● | The cancellation of U.S. Government contracts; and  \n● | Our ability to secure agreements from our major customers for the purchase of our products.  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\n\n_Our customers who purchase display products for defense applications typically incorporate our products into their products, which are sold to the U.S. Government under contracts. U.S. Government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business._ Congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis, and Congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget. Many of our customers’ contracts cover multiple years and, as such, are not fully funded at contract award. If Congress or a U.S. Government agency chooses to spend money on other programs, our customers’ contracts may be terminated for convenience. The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law. Therefore, the Anti-Deficiency Act indirectly regulates how agencies award our contracts and pay our invoices. Federal government contracts generally contain provisions that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to, among other things: terminate our existing contracts; modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors; suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders; and claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\n\nThe federal government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either \"for convenience” (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and possibly retain any profit on the work that was completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. As is common with government contractors, we have experienced occasional performance issues under some of our contracts. We have received Stop Work Orders wherein work is suspended pending a review of the program. We may in the future receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the federal government’s satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, extensive specification and performance requirements, price negotiations and milestone requirements. Each U.S. Government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply, and which can vary significantly among agencies.\n\n_We recognize revenue for some of our defense contracts and some commercial contracts on the over-time method which requires significant management judgment, and errors in our judgment could result in our revenue being overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment_. For certain contracts with the U.S. Government, we recognize revenue over time as we perform services or manufacture the goods. The continuous transfer of control to, or performance of services for, the customer is subject to liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred and may allow a reasonable profit, and take control of any work in process. Contracts with commercial customers may have a similar liability clause. In situations where control transfers or services are performed over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the contractual obligation for our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Accounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability, delivery date and cost of materials and the performance of our subcontractors. Due to the number of significant factors affecting revenue recognition, forecasting revenue at a point in time in the future is difficult. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated, and realization is considered probable. If our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect, our revenue could be overstated or understated, and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment. If our revenues and costs require adjustment, our stock price could decline.\n\n_A decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results_. In addition to the Anti-Deficiency Act, in recent years U.S. Government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated and have been difficult to predict. Future spending levels are subject to a wide range of factors, including Congressional action. In addition, in recent years the U.S. Government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a government shutdown and continuing resolutions to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. Government agencies to continue operating. Most recently, the federal government was shut down due to a lack of funding for over one month between late 2018 and early 2019. Additionally, the national debt has recently threatened to reach the statutory debt ceiling in 2024, and such an event in future years could result in the U.S. Government defaulting on its debts.\n\nAs a result, defense spending levels are difficult to predict beyond the near term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future government priorities and the state of government finances. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. Government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n_If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions._ We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government customers. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may result in fines and penalties, including contractual damages. Among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are:\n\n● | The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulates the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts;  \n---|---  \n● | The Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;  \n● | The Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based federal government contracts; and  \n● | Laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data. We engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of U.S. export control laws. Failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government.  \n  \nOur contracting agency customers may review our performance under and in compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts. If a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including:\n\n● | Termination of contracts;  \n---|---  \n● | Forfeiture of profits;  \n● | Cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses;  \n● | Suspension of payments;  \n● | Fines; and  \n● | Suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, the False Claims Act provides for substantial civil penalties where, for example, a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. Civil actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\n\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts. If we are subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, our current business, future prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed.\n\nThe U.S. Government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, at any time. Any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy, be administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\n\n_Our ability to manufacture and distribute our display products would be severely limited if the foundries that we rely on to manufacture integrated circuits for our display products fail to provide those services._ We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our defense display products. In addition, we use a Chinese foundry’s services for OLED deposition and processing of OLED displays. We also use foundries in Korea and France and are evaluating other European foundries. We have no long-term contracts with the foundries we use and from time to time we have been put on allocation, which means the foundry will limit or delay the number of wafers they will process for us. If foundries were to terminate or amend their arrangement with us or become unable to provide the required capacity, services and or quality on a timely basis, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our display products or we may be forced to manufacture them in limited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms.\n\nOur reliance on these foundries involves certain risks, including but not limited to:\n\n● | Lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules;  \n---|---  \n● | Limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;  \n● | The risks associated with international commerce, including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability; and  \n● | Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, mudslides, drought, hurricanes and tornadoes.  \n  \nDue to natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons that have occasionally occurred in Asia, many Taiwanese companies, including the Taiwanese foundry we use, have experienced related business interruptions. Our business could suffer significantly if any of the foundries we use have their operations disrupted for an extended period of time due to natural disasters, political unrest or financial instability.\n\n_We may be unable to adequately control purchase pricing of certain critical materials, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability._ We have no long-term pricing contracts on foundry wafers and certain other materials that represent a significant portion of our product bill of material costs. We cannot provide assurance against supplier price increases that negatively impact the cost of producing products, which may adversely affect sales or profitability. Finding and/or qualifying a more cost-effective replacement supplier may take significant time.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n_The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully._ There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The individual components that we offer for sale (displays, optical lenses, backlights and ASICs) are also offered by companies whose sole business focuses on that individual component. For example, there are companies whose sole business is to sell optical lenses. Accordingly, our strategy requires us to develop technologies and to compete in multiple markets. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, development and marketing resources than we do. The competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.\n\nOur success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements. If we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes, our business will suffer.\n\n_Disruptions of our production could adversely affect our operating results._ If we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities, we would be unable to supply our products to our customers. Many of our sales contracts include financial penalties for late delivery. In the past, we have experienced power outages at our facilities, which ranged in duration from one to four days. We have certain critical pieces of equipment necessary to operate our facilities that are no longer offered for sale and we may not have service contracts or spare parts for the equipment. Additionally, as we introduce new equipment into our manufacturing processes, our display products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency. We may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations.\n\n_A disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations, revenue and profitability._ Our data processing systems and our Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP”) software are cloud-based and hosted by third parties. We also use software packages that are no longer supported by their developer. We have experienced short-term (i.e., a few days) interruptions in our Internet connectivity. An interruption of the third-party systems or the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the third-party systems for an extended period may affect our ability to operate our business and process transactions, which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\n\n_Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products, as well as changes in cybersecurity and if our information technology security systems were infiltrated and confidential and/or proprietary information were taken, we could be subject to fines, lawsuits and loss of customers_. Significantly larger organizations with much greater resources than us have been the victim of cybercrimes. We routinely receive emails probing our Internet security, and our Internet security systems have detected outside organizations attempting to install Trojan virus software packages in our systems. We rely on our electronic information systems to perform routine transactions to run our business. We transact business over the Internet with customers, vendors and our subsidiaries and have implemented security measures to protect against unauthorized access to this information. We have also implemented security policies that limit access via the Internet from the Company to the outside world based on the individual’s position in the Company. We routinely receive security patches from software providers for the software we use. Our primary concerns are inappropriate access to personnel information, information covered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, product designs and manufacturing information, financial information and our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how. Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyberattacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. Cybersecurity threats are continuously evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, proprietary, or otherwise protected information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. Any such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential, proprietary, or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. The threats we face are continuous and evolving and vary in degree of severity and sophistication. These threats include advanced persistent threats from highly organized adversaries, including but not limited to cyber criminals, nation states and so-called hacktivists, particularly those adverse to the security interests of the U.S. and its allies, which target us and other defense contractors. These types of threats are related to the geopolitical environment and have, therefore, grown in number due to recent geopolitical conflicts. In addition, as a result of the rapid pace of technological change, we and our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we conduct business continue to rely on legacy systems and software, which can be more vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks. Moreover, we, like other companies, are seeing an unprecedented number of previously unknown vulnerabilities, for which there are no known mitigations, being revealed by new attacks. Further, the sophistication, availability and use of artificial intelligence by threat actors present an increased level of risk. Due to the evolving threat landscape, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience more frequent and increasingly advanced cyber-attacks. In addition, changes in domestic and international cybersecurity-related laws and regulations have expanded cybersecurity-related compliance requirements, and cybersecurity regulatory enforcement activity has grown. We expect the regulatory environment to continue to evolve, and staying apace with these regulatory changes could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, and lead to new or additional information technology and product development expenses. We also face reputational, litigation and financial risks in relation to potential required disclosures and increased risk of enforcement. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats, as well as to comply with evolving regulations. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to defend against all cyber-attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In some cases, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats and attacks. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted.\n\n_We may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of our equity investments._ At December 30, 2023, we had equity investments in companies totaling $4.7 million, where we have limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments. We are required to periodically review the value of these investments for impairment. For example, in the second quarter of 2023, we reviewed the financial condition and other factors of our investment in a customer and as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment. These investments may not contribute to our earnings or cash flows. In addition, these investments may be required to raise additional capital, which may result in our ownership percentage being decreased.\n\n_If we are unable to obtain or maintain existing software license relationships or other relationships relating to the intellectual property we use, our ability to grow revenue and achieve profitability and positive cash flow may be negatively affected._ Our headset systems include software that we license from other companies. Should we violate the terms of a license, our license could be canceled. Companies may decide to stop supporting the software we license, or new versions of the software may not be compatible with our software, which would require us to rewrite our software, which we may not be able to do. Moreover, the license fees we pay may be increased, which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n_We may incur substantial costs in defending our intellectual property and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights._ Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems, and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. We have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. Our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ or consulting for us. These measures may not adequately protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws afford only limited protection and our patents could be invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not provide full protection of our intellectual property rights. Misappropriation of our technology and the costs of defending our intellectual property rights from misappropriation could substantially impair our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our business may not be successful, and the price of our common stock may decline.\n\n_The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from currently pending or future patent applications. We cannot be certain that domestic or foreign intellectual property laws will allow the protection of our intellectual property rights or that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around any patents issued or licensed to us._ We may be subject to or may initiate contested patent or patent application proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, foreign patent offices or the courts, which can demand significant financial and management resources. Patent applications in the U.S. typically are maintained in secrecy until they are published about 18 months after their earliest claim to priority. As publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive of inventions covered by our pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. We also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications or those of our licensors will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will provide adequate protection against a competitor. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license or could force us to retool or cease manufacturing and sales of products covered by these patents, nor can we be sure that licenses, if needed, would be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\n\n_We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. We believe that our future success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees in addition to patent ownership._ Our employees enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ. Agreements with consultants generally provide that rights to inventions made by them while consulting for us will be assigned to us unless the assignment of rights is prohibited by the terms of any of their prior agreements. Agreements with employees, consultants and collaborators contain provisions intended to further protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. To date, we have had no experience in enforcing these agreements. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breaches. Our trade secrets may not be secure from discovery or independent development by competitors, in which case we may not be able to rely on these trade secrets to prevent our competitors from using them.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n_Our business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel._ To continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business, we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business. Our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees. The loss of the services of one or more key employees, including Mr. Murray, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could seriously impede our success. We do not maintain any \"key-man” insurance policies on Mr. Murray or any other employees. In addition, due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers, our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management, technical, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions. Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to develop and manufacture our products.\n\n_If we fail to keep pace with changing technologies, we may lose customers._ Rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving technologies and industry standards characterize our industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences. We may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\n_Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us._ The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act”) imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We have incurred additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins of all metals used in our products. We purchase materials from foreign sources that may not cooperate and provide us with the necessary information to allow us to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. This may require us to find alternative sources, which could delay product shipments. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict-free.\n\n_Changes in tax laws, an unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity._ We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Korea, China and the United Kingdom. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally changes the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could materially affect our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\n\n_We may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental laws and regulations and the ITAR, or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past._ We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic or other hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. We are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws that regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use these products for defense purposes. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not violated applicable laws or regulations in the past, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n_We may be unable to modify our products to meet regulatory or customer requirements._ From time to time our display products are subject to new domestic and international requirements, such as the European Union’s Restriction on Hazardous Substances Directive. Our customers’ terms and conditions require us to be in compliance with \"all laws.” If we are unable to comply with these regulations, we may not be permitted to ship our products, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to maintain profitability. In addition, if we are found to be in violation of laws, we may be subject to fines and penalties.\n\n_We may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions and investments, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._ In the past, we have made, and in the future, we may make acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, products and technologies that could complement or expand our business. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our existing business and products. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets.\n\nAdditionally, we have several investments where we may have limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting, and operations. As a result, we face certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments. As a result, these investments may not contribute to our earnings or cash flows. In addition, these investments may be required to raise additional capital, which may result in our ownership percentage being decreased.\n\n_Changes in China’s laws, legal protections or government policies on foreign investment in China may harm our business._ Our business and corporate transactions are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China as well as laws and regulations applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. These laws and regulations frequently change, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to us. Regulations and rules on foreign investments in China impose restrictions on the means that a foreign investor like us may apply to facilitate corporate transactions we may undertake. In addition, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. If any of our past operations are deemed to be non-compliant with Chinese law, we may be subject to penalties and our business and operations may be adversely affected. For instance, under the catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, some industries are categorized as sectors that are encouraged, restricted or prohibited for foreign investment. As the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries is updated every few years, there can be no assurance that China’s government will not change its policies in a manner that would render part or all of our business to fall within the restricted or prohibited categories. If we cannot obtain approval from relevant authorities to engage in businesses that have become prohibited or restricted for foreign investors, we may be forced to sell or restructure such businesses. Furthermore, China’s government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. If we are forced to adjust our corporate structure or business as a result of changes in government policy on foreign investment or changes in the interpretation and application of existing or new laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed. Moreover, uncertainties in the Chinese legal system may impede our ability to enforce contracts with our business partners, customers and suppliers, or otherwise pursue claims in litigation to recover damages or loss of property, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n_Raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict our operations._ To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. We may sell shares or other securities in other offerings at a price per share that is less than the prices per share paid by other investors, and investors purchasing shares of our common stock or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders.\n\n_We have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment during that time is if the price of our common stock appreciates._ Historically, our earnings, if any, have been retained for the development of our businesses. Any recommendation by our Board of Directors to pay dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, and other factors. Accordingly, if the price of our common stock declines in the foreseeable future, you will incur a loss on your investment, without the likelihood that this loss will be offset in part or at all by potential future cash dividends.\n\n_Our operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects._ Credit rating downgrades in certain European countries and/or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the EU create uncertain global economic conditions. The ongoing uncertainty could have a negative economic impact and result in further volatility in the markets for several years. The impact of the Brexit referendum and such ongoing uncertainty may result in various economic and financial consequences for businesses operating in the UK, the EU and beyond. We hold significant assets in the UK and operate a UK subsidiary, and the future impacts of Brexit and the continued uncertainty surrounding the EU could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n_Changes in government trade policies may increase the cost of our products, which may materially adversely affect our sales or profitability._ We depend on a Taiwanese foundry for the manufacture of integrated circuits for our AMLCD display products and on Chinese and Korean foundries for our OLED display products. In recent years the U.S. has imposed, among other actions, new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from China in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices, and China has responded by proposing or implementing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the U.S. Tariffs on components that we import from China or other nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs have in some cases and may in the future cause our expenses to increase, which would adversely affect our profitability unless we were able to exclude our products from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. In addition, future actions or escalations by either the U.S. or China that affect trade relations may also affect our business or that of our suppliers or customers, and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take. Moreover, it is uncertain to what extent, if any, the U.S. tariffs on components that we import from China will affect the Taiwanese foundries on which we depend, in part because many Taiwanese foundries conduct parts of their manufacturing in China.\n\nA protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. To the extent that our sales or profitability are affected negatively by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\n_As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._ While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Item 1B.** | **_Unresolved Staff Comments_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 1C.** | **_Cybersecurity_**  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a company selling products for defense applications, we may be the target of cyber-attacks from a variety of threat actors. Cybersecurity threats include attacks on, or other attempts to infiltrate, our information technology (IT) infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers, and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attempts to infiltrate our products or services, including attacks targeting the security, confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities, or infrastructure.\n\nOur Cybersecurity Program\n\nOur products and services are normally classified as EAR 99 by the U.S. government, but our defense customers may ask us to make some alterations for the environments the products will be used in. Moreover, our products sold for defense applications are integrated with our customers’ products and these customers may provide us with Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that requires, safeguarding and dissemination controls in accordance with laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies. Given the nature of our business and the cybersecurity risks we face, we have instituted a cybersecurity program for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks, which include material risks from cybersecurity threats to our internal systems, our products, services and programs for customers, and our supply chain.\n\nOur enterprise cybersecurity program aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, among others. The program includes processes and controls for the deployment of new IT systems by the Company and controls over new and existing system operations. We, or third parties we contract with, monitor and conduct regular testing of these controls and systems, including vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to regularly assess patching and configuration status. In addition, we require our employees to complete annual cybersecurity training, and we regularly conduct simulated phishing and cyber-related communications.\n\nIncident Response.\n\nOur cybersecurity program includes monitoring for potential security threats that may lead to vulnerabilities. We evaluate and assign severity levels to incidents, escalate and engage an incident response team based on severity, and manage and mitigate the related risks. Incidents are reported internally to members of senior management and/or the Board of Directors as appropriate based on severity and incident type and are also analyzed for external reporting requirements. Our incident response process is also designed to coordinate functions to enable continuity of essential business operation in the event of a cyber crisis.\n\nThird Party Service Providers.\n\nWe engage third party service providers to expand the capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program, including for design, monitoring and testing of the program’s risk prevention and protection measures, and process execution including incident detection, investigation, analysis and response, eradication, and recovery.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nProgram Assessment.\n\nWe continuously evaluate and seek to improve and mature our cybersecurity processes. Our cybersecurity program is regularly assessed through management self-evaluation and ongoing monitoring procedures to evaluate our program effectiveness, including assessments associated with internal controls over financial reporting as well as vulnerability management through active discovery and testing to validate patching and configuration. As cybersecurity threats are continuously evolving, we also periodically engage with third parties to perform maturity assessments of our program to identify potential risk areas and improvement opportunities. This includes assessment of our overall program, policies and processes, compliance with regulatory requirements and an overall assessment of key vulnerabilities. We use these assessments to supplement our own evaluation of the overall health of our program and target improvement areas.\n\nBoard Oversight and Management’s Role\n\nOur Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee also considers enterprise cybersecurity risks in connection with its financial and compliance risk oversight role. The Chief Financial Officer regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the status of the Company’s cybersecurity program and provides the Board with the annual assessment by a third party on the Company’s cybersecurity program. Cybersecurity risks are also included with the Company’s annual business risk assessment which is provided to the Board of Directors.\n\nFor more information on risks related to cybersecurity, see Item IA. \"Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\n\n**Item 2.** | **_Properties_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe lease our 74,000 square foot production facility in Westborough, Massachusetts, 10,000 square feet of which is contiguous environmentally controlled production clean rooms operated between Class 10 and Class 1,000 levels.\n\nNVIS, our subsidiary in Reston, Virginia, leases 6,100 square feet in Reston. FDD, our subsidiary in Scotland, leases 20,000 square feet in Dalgety Bay, 5,000 square feet of which is contiguous environmentally controlled production clean rooms operated between Class 10 and Class 10,000 levels. FDD also leases an office in Berlin, Germany.\n\nAt this time, we believe these properties are suitable for our needs for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Item 3.** | **_Legal Proceedings_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (\"the Court”), alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning an alleged joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleges that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications, and denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. Additional factual and expert discovery ordered by The Court has been completed. A trial date has been set by the Court for March 20, 2024. The Company has not concluded a loss from this matter is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation or claims related to this matter for the period ended December 30, 2023. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\n\n**Item 4.** | **_Mine Safety Disclosures_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**Part II**\n\n**Item 5.** | **_Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities._**  \n---|---  \n  \nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"KOPN”.\n\nAs of March 7, 2024, there were approximately 291 shareholders of record of our common stock, which does not reflect those shares held beneficially or those shares held in \"street” name.\n\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past, nor do we expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks discussed in \"Item 1A- Risk Factors”, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Please refer to our cautionary note on Forward-Looking Statements on page 3 of this Form 10-K._\n\nWe are a leading developer and provider of high-performance application-specific optical solutions consisting of high-resolution microdisplays and optics, microdisplays subassemblies and headsets. We define microdisplays as displays that have a diagonal measurement of less than 2 inches. Our products are used for defense applications (soldier thermal weapon rifle sights, avionic fixed and rotary wing pilot helmets, armored vehicle targeting systems, and training & simulation headsets); industrial and medical headsets; and 3D optical inspection systems. We believe that the technologies we are developing may eventually be used in consumer augmented reality (\"AR”) and virtual reality (\"VR”) wearable headsets systems. Our products are primarily used to overlay digital information on the real-world scene.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition under the cost-to-cost measurement method, bad debts, inventories, warranty reserves, investment valuations, valuation of stock compensation awards, recoverability of deferred tax assets, liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nSubstantially all of our product revenues are derived from the sales of microdisplays, which are sold as individual displays, modules that include electronics and optics, or higher-level subassemblies for use in defense, industrial and consumer near-eye applications such as avionic helmets, thermal weapon sights or virtual reality headsets. We also have development contracts for the design, manufacture and modification of products for the U.S. Government or a prime contractor for the U.S. Government or for a customer that sells into the industrial or consumer markets. The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR”) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer.\n\nOur fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government or other customers may result in revenue recognized in excess of amounts currently billed. We disclose the excess of revenues over amounts actually billed as Contract assets and unbilled receivables on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the balance sheets. In some instances, the U.S. Government retains a small portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. The portion of the payments retained until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government, we typically receive interim payments either as work progresses, by achieving certain milestones or based on a schedule in the contract. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned on the balance sheets. The advanced payment typically is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For industrial and consumer purchase orders, we typically receive payments within 30 to 60 days of shipment of the product, although for some purchase orders, we may require advanced payment prior to shipment of the product.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts with the same customer, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of our development contracts and contracts with the U.S. Government, the customer contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a set of components into a single unit. Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less frequently, however, we may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case we separate the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. In cases where we sell standard products, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\n\nFor certain contracts with the U.S. Government, the Company recognizes revenue over time as we deliver goods or perform services because of continuous transfer of control to the customer and the lack of an alternative use for the product. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is subject to liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. For contracts with commercial customers, while the contract may have a similar liability clause, our products historically have an alternative use and thus, revenue is recognized at a point in time.\n\nIn situations where control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation for our contracts because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\n\nAccounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. We have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials and performance by our subcontractors. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. If our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone achievement is incorrect, our revenue could be overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nFor our commercial customers, the Company’s revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied and the Company transfers control of the products or performs services, which is generally upon delivery of the product to the customer or performance of the services. Revenue is recorded as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Provisions for product returns and allowances are reductions in the transaction price and are recorded in the same period as the related revenues. We analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances. Certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products. Sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors’ customers and not for stocking of inventory. Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n\nThe Company also licenses its intellectual property (\"IP”) through technology license agreements which provides the customer the right to use our IP as it exists at a point in time. These agreements may include other performance obligations including the sale of product to the customer. The satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation, and related recognition of revenue, occurs when the IP is delivered to the customer, the license period has begun and there are no additional performance obligations in the agreement. When the license is distinct from other obligations in the agreement, the Company treats the license and other performance obligations as separate performance obligations. Accordingly, the license is recognized at a point in time or over time based on the standalone selling price. Under certain license agreements, we may receive royalties based on the sales of the licensed product. We recognize royalty revenue upon the later of when the related sales occur, or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Under our current license agreements for which a royalty exists, we have recorded revenue when the related sales by our customer occurs because the performance obligation related to the delivery of the license to the customer has been satisfied.\n\n_Inventory_\n\nWe provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans. Inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved (representing the estimated net realizable value) as such information becomes available. Our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non-binding demand forecasts provided by our customers, lead times for raw materials, lead time for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields. If a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand, we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required. If we were unable to sell the excess inventory, we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value (generally zero).\n\n_Investment Valuation_\n\nWe periodically make equity investments in private companies, accounted for as an equity investment, whose values are difficult to determine. The Company adopted ASU No. _2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities_ and the related amendments on December 31, 2017. The Company adopted the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values (often referred to as cost method investments) on a prospective basis. When assessing investments in private companies for impairment, we consider such factors as, among others, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. Because these are private companies that we do not control we may not be able to obtain all of the information we would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis. Accordingly, our estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date.\n\nIn addition to the above, we make investments in government and agency-backed securities and corporate debt securities. For all of our investments, we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The determination of whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary requires that we estimate the cash flows we expect to receive from the security. We use publicly available information such as credit ratings and financial information of the entity that issued the security in the development of our expectation of the cash flows to be received. Historically, we have periodically recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses, however we have not done so recently.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n_Income Taxes_\n\nWe have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint. We establish valuation allowances to the extent it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized. These judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. Given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term. It is possible that we could pay foreign and state income taxes. We are also subject to foreign taxes from our Korean and U.K. subsidiary operations.\n\nOur income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities. Despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes or foreign tax that may be due. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Should the actual results differ from our estimates, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations. We have historically established valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets because of our history of generating operating losses and restrictions on the use of certain items. Our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets has also included an analysis of the expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards. In forming our conclusions as to whether the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we consider the sources of our income and the projected stability of those sources and product life cycles.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe have two principal sources of revenues: product revenues and research and development (\"R&D”) revenues. R&D revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial enterprises.\n\nWe manufacture Active-matrix Liquid Crystal (\"AMLCD”) transmissive and Liquid Crystal on Silicon (\"LCOS”) reflective microdisplays. Our AMLCD display production is being performed entirely in our Westborough, Massachusetts facility. FDD, our wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures our LCOS microdisplays in its facility located in Scotland. Our OLED displays are designed by us and manufactured by third parties for us.\n\nWe are a display supplier for the U.S. Army’s Family of Weapon Sights-Individual and Joint Strike Fighter F-35 programs and are undergoing qualification for the FWS - Crew Served variant. We are also in development for new display systems for armored vehicles and a medical headset for surgeons. Our existing and new production programs are expected to increase production for the next several years. There are other firms offering products which compete against us in the defense programs and all of the programs we supply product to are subject to the U.S. Government defense budget and procurement process. Accordingly, there can be no assurances we will continue to ship under our defense contracts.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \nPredicting our R&D revenue and related trends is challenging because we have limited ability to forecast whether we will be awarded additional R&D contracts in the future as such awards depend on the U.S. military budget and priorities. We cannot assure that the R&D contracts will result in workable products or if successful our products developed under these contracts will be procured by our customers. If we do not continue to win R&D contracts or if there is no demand for the products developed under these contracts, our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow could be negatively affected because the R&D revenues (or the products derived from the R&D contracts) would not be available to cover the allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs which may remain. Some of our contracts are fixed priced and we may incur cost overruns that would result in losses on the contracts. If we incur such losses on our contracts our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow could be negatively affected.\n\n**_Because our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December, every seven years we have a fiscal year with 53 weeks. Our fiscal year 2023 was a 52-week year, 2022 was a 53-week year and 2021 was a 52-week year._**\n\n_Revenues._ Our revenues by display application, which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts, for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by category, were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nDefense | $| 22,615 | $| 24,780 | $| 18,180  \nIndustrial/Enterprise | 2,736 | 6,136 | 9,710  \nConsumer | 573 | 1,497 | 1,871  \nResearch and Development | 13,455 | 14,357 | 14,669  \nOther | 13 | 7 | 121  \nLicense and royalties | 1,002 | 624 | 1,115  \nTotal Revenues | $| 40,394 | $| 47,401 | $| 45,666  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. Sales of our products for Defense applications may be for a one-time purchase or for programs that run for several years. Revenues from product sales to defense customers decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in shipments of our products for thermal weapon sight applications that was partially offset by an increase in sales of our products for defense pilot helmets and training and simulation programs.\n\nIndustrial/Enterprise applications revenues represent customers who purchase our display products for use in headsets used for manufacturing, distribution, public safety, 3D metrology equipment and other industrial applications. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and they sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The decrease in Industrial/Enterprise applications revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in sales to customers who use our display components in 3D metrology equipment and industrial headsets.\n\nSales of our displays for Consumer applications are primarily for use in thermal imaging products, recreational rifle and hand-held scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our OLED displays for consumer applications.\n\nR&D revenues decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreased funding for new display technology development for U.S. defense programs and OLED display development, which was partially offset by increased funding for armor vehicle targeting system and medical headset development. These contracts typically reimburse us for direct costs and allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs and in some cases profit. In 2023 and 2022, our R&D revenues exceeded funded R&D expenses by approximately $6.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively.\n\nThe increase in license and royalty revenue in 2023 compared to 2022 is due to an increase in royalties earned under IP license agreements for industrial wearable headsets.\n\nInternational product sales represented approximately 13% and 22% of product revenues for 2023 and 2022, respectively. We categorize our revenues as either domestic or international based upon the delivery destination of our product. For example, if the customer is located in Asia or if a U.S. customer has its Asian contract manufacturer order product from us and we deliver the product to Asia, we categorize both these sales as international. In addition, if we earn royalties on sales from a customer, the royalties are categorized as domestic or international based on how the product revenues are categorized. Our international sales decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to a decrease in sales of our products for 3D metrology application by our subsidiary, FDD, our OLED displays for consumer applications and industrial headset products manufactured overseas. Our international sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors’ products that are denominated in local currencies, which could result in a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets. As a result, our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency. We have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations, such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations, because of the historically stable exchange rate between the Japanese yen, Great Britain pound and the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation impact on our results, if material, is described in further detail under \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section below.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nSales of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. Sales of our products for Defense applications may be for a one-time purchase or for programs that run for several years. Revenues from product sales to defense customers increased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in shipments of our products into the FWS- Individual, Joint Strike Fighter and training and simulation programs.\n\nIndustrial/Enterprise applications revenues represent customers who purchase our display products for use in headsets used for manufacturing, distribution, public safety, 3D metrology equipment and other industrial applications. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and they sell to Asian contract manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The decrease in Industrial/Enterprise applications revenues in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in sales to customers who use our display components in 3D metrology equipment and industrial headsets.\n\nSales of our displays for Consumer applications are primarily for use in thermal imaging products, recreational rifle and hand-held scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to decreased demand for our organic light emitting displays (\"OLEDs”).\n\nR&D revenues decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to reduced funding for new display technology development for U.S. defense programs, which was partially offset by increased funding for OLED display development. These contracts typically reimburse us for direct costs and allocated overhead and selling, general and administrative costs and in some cases profit. In 2022 and 2021, our R&D revenues exceeded funded R&D expenses by approximately $4.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in license and royalty revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 is due to lower royalties earned under IP license agreements for industrial wearable headsets.\n\nInternational product sales represented approximately 22% and 38% of product revenues for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our international sales decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to a decrease in sales of our products for 3D metrology application by our subsidiary, FDD and industrial headset products manufactured overseas.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n_Cost of Product Revenues._ Cost of product revenues, which is comprised of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nCost of product revenues | $| 24,952 | $| 32,559 | $| 25,052  \nCost of product revenues as a % of net product revenues | 96.2| % | 100| % | 83.8| %  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nCost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products for defense applications in 2023 versus 2022 and lower sales of lower margin products from defense applications in 2023 versus 2022. The Company also implemented several programs and hired additional employees to improve manufacturing quality and efficiencies.\n\nThe issues associated with the global shortage of semiconductor circuit chips and other raw materials decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022 and 2021. However, we have identified several semiconductor components which continue to have long lead delivery times. We continue to search for and procure all necessary components from our current vendors and new alternative vendors. In certain situations, we can obtain the components but at a significantly increased cost. The inability to procure a single component will prevent the completion of our product and the ability to sell the product. Our products go through extensive qualification processes and therefore our customers may not accept a replacement component. We are unable to determine if we will be able to obtain all necessary components for fiscal 2024. If we are unable to obtain all necessary components, we may be required to stop production, which would negatively affect our cash flow and results of operations.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nCost of product revenues increased as a percentage of revenues in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to lower production volumes in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2022. In fiscal 2022, we had lower manufacturing efficiencies driven by disruptions to the manufacturing process caused by intermittent raw material shortages and higher prices for raw materials. Also, in the third quarter of 2022, we incurred $1.0 million in warranty charges due to quality issues. In the fourth quarter of 2022, gross margins declined due to lower absorption of costs as we reduced production to make process changes in manufacturing the products.\n\n_Research and Development._ R&D expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. R&D costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of display products and allocated overhead. In fiscal year 2023, our Funded R&D expenditures were primarily related to our display products and defense systems and our Internal R&D was primarily related to the development of OLED displays. R&D expenses for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nFunded | $| 7,177 | $| 10,280 | $| 9,976  \nInternal | 3,600 | 8,388 | 6,312  \nTotal | $| 10,777 | $| 18,668 | $| 16,288  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nFunded R&D expense for 2023 decreased as compared to 2022 primarily due to the completion of contracts for defense programs awarded prior to 2023. Internal R&D expense for 2023 decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased OLED development.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nFunded R&D expense for 2022 increased as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of defense related contracts we have been awarded. Internal R&D expense for 2022 increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased OLED development.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative._ Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A”) expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and administrative and general corporate expenses. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands, except percentages) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nSelling, general and administrative expense | $| 21,842 | $| 17,965 | $| 18,101  \nSelling, general and administrative expense as a % of total revenue | 54.1| % | 37.9| % | 39.6| %  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nSG&A for 2023 increased as compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase of approximately $5.0 million in legal and professional fees and $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in compensation and benefits.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nSG&A for 2022 decreased as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of approximately $2.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in compensation and benefits and $1.4 million of higher professional fees.\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n_Total Non-operating (Expense) Income._ Non-operating (expense) income is primarily composed of interest income, revaluation and impairment of equity investments, foreign currency transactions, remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our UK-based subsidiaries and other non-operating income items. Non-operating (expense) income for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n(In thousands) | **2023** | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal non-operating (expense) income | **$** | **(2,415** | **)** | $ | 2,608 | $ | 436  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nIn 2023, we recorded $3.3 million of impairment losses on equity investments. In 2022, we recorded a gain of $4.7 million resulting from the revaluation of an equity investment. Also in 2022, we recorded a $2.0 million impairment charge on an equity investment. In 2023, we recorded $0.2 million of foreign currency losses compared to $0.3 million of foreign currency losses recorded in 2022.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nIn 2022 we recorded a gain of $4.7 million resulting from the revaluation of an equity investment. In 2022 we recorded a $2.0 million impairment charge on an equity investment. Also in 2022, we recorded $0.3 million of foreign currency losses compared to $0.1 million of foreign currency gains recorded in 2021.\n\n_Tax provision_\n\n(In thousands) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nTax provision | $| (156| ) | $| (144| ) | $| (129| )  \n  \n_Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022_\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022 of approximately $(0.2) million and $(0.1) million, respectively, was due to the accretion of additional potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities for the Company’s former Korean subsidiary.\n\n_Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021_\n\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021 of approximately $(0.1) million was due to the accretion of additional potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities for the Company’s former Korean subsidiary.\n\n_Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest._ In the first quarter of 2023, we acquired the remaining interest in eMDT. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on our consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of our majority owned subsidiaries which is allocated to the shareholders of the equity interests not owned by us. The change in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2023 compared to 2022 was less than $0.1 million and in 2022 compared to 2021 was less than $0.1 million and was the result of operations of eMDT.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and marketable securities of $17.9 million and working capital of $24.0 million compared to $12.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to gross proceeds of $22.9 million received from the sale of 17,000,000 shares of common stock and the pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per share. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we sold 2.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $16 million (average of $6.66 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.5 million pursuant to the Company’s At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated as of February 8, 2019 (the \"Previous ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, (\"Stifel”) as agent. In the second quarter of 2021, we sold 0.1 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.8 million (average of $6.74 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.1 million under the Previous ATM Agreement. The Previous ATM Agreement has since terminated pursuant to its terms as a result of the sale of all the shares subject to such agreement. On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a new At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Current ATM Agreement”) with Stifel under which we may sell up to $50 million of our common stock. In the third quarter of 2021, we sold 0.6 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $4.8 million (average of $8.06 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by us of $0.1 million under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we sold 1.5 million shares of common stock and 0.2 million shares of treasury stock for gross proceeds of $2.1 million (average of $1.26 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of less than $0.1 million and in the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold 675,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $0.9 million (average of $1.27 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of less than $0.1 million, pursuant to the Current ATM Agreement. The net proceeds from the sale of common shares were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital. \n\nOn January 27, 2023, we sold 17 million shares of registered common stock to certain investors and issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The gross proceeds of these transactions were $22.9 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by us of $1.5 million. At December 30, 2023, we had available $41.4 million for sale of common stock under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn February 2024, we sold 3.1 million shares of common stock under our Current ATM for gross proceeds of $7.5 million at an average per share price of $2.42 before deducting underwriting expenses of $0.2 million. Our Current ATM and our shelf registration statement expired on March 5, 2024. We expect to file a new shelf registration statement and enter into a new ATM in 2024.\n\nThe following table presents the components of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities held in U.S. dollars as of the dates presented:\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nDomestic locations | $| 17,725,979 | $| 11,778,324  \nForeign locations | 95,547 | 629,793  \nSubtotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities held in U.S. dollars | 17,821,526 | 12,408,117  \nCash and cash equivalents held in other currencies and converted to U.S. dollars | 81,159 | 239,539  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities | $| 17,902,685 | $| 12,647,656  \n  \nWe have no plans to repatriate the cash and cash equivalents held in our foreign subsidiary FDD.\n\nThe manufacturing operations at our Korean facility, Kowon, have ceased and Kowon was liquidated at fiscal year ended 2018. We have recorded deferred tax liabilities for any additional withholding tax that may be due to the Korean government upon Kowon’s final tax return acceptance.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nWe have incurred net losses of $19.7 million, $19.3 million and $13.4 million for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million, $17.7 million and $10.7 million for the fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our net cash outflows from operations was partially a result of funding our ongoing investments in research and development which we believe will continue. We have in the past sold equity securities through an at the market offering and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings. We estimate we will have sufficient liquidity to fund operations at least through the first quarter of 2025. Nonetheless, we monitor the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If our actual results are less than projected or we need to raise capital for additional liquidity, we may be required to do additional equity financings, reduce expenses or enter into a strategic transaction. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n**Seasonality**\n\nOur revenues have not followed a seasonal pattern for the past three years and we do not anticipate any seasonal trend to our revenues in 2024.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\nUnder our former CEO’s (\"Dr. Fan”) employment agreement, commencing in January 2023, Dr. Fan (or in the event of his death prior to completion of all installments to his surviving spouse, or if none to his estate) would receive $1,500,000 in twenty-four (24) equal monthly installments. As of December 30, 2023, we owed Dr. Fan $750,000 which will be paid in equal monthly installments during 2024. In addition, under Dr. Fan’s employment agreement he receives $40,000 per year through 2033.\n\nThe following is a summary of our contractual lease payment obligations as of December 30, 2023:\n\nPayment due by period  \n---  \nTotal | Less than 1 year | 1-3 Years | 4-5 years | More than 5 years  \nOperating Lease Obligations | $| 2,844,590 | 795,884 | 1,847,373 | 201,333 | —  \n  \n41  \n---  \n  \n**Item 7A.** | **_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk_**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe invest our excess cash in high-quality U.S. Government, government-backed (i.e., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) and corporate debt instruments, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrealized gain or loss on debt securities. We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ financial position, results of operations, and transaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash flows related to business activities in Asia and Europe, and remeasurement of U.S. dollars to the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary. We are also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials which are in U.S. dollars but the price on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations or investments is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Our portfolio of marketable debt securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments may be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. We use silicon wafers in our production processes but do not enter into forward or futures hedging contracts.\n\n**Item 8.** | **_Financial Statements and Supplementary Data_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe financial statements required by this Item are included in this Report on pages 44 through 72. Reference is made to Item 15 of this Report.\n\n**Item 9.** | **_Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 9A.** | **_Controls and Procedures_**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nIn connection with filing the Form 10-K, management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n**Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and procedures that:\n\n● | Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  \n---|---  \n● | Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  \n● | Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 30, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**Item 9B.** | **_Other Information_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNone.\n\n**Item 9C.** | **_Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspection_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 10.** | **_Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe information required under this item is incorporated herein by reference to our Proxy Statement relating to our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Proxy Statement”). We expect to file the Proxy Statement with the SEC in April 2024 (and, in any event, no later than 120 days after the close of our last fiscal year).\n\n_Code of Ethics_. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (\"the Code”) that applies to all of our employees (including our CEO and CFO) and directors.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \n**Research and Development Revenues**\n\nThe Company’s research and development revenues, where control transfers over time and revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, were $13,454,866 for the year ended December 30, 2023, and are described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes revenue for certain of its research and development contracts over time, generally measuring progress using the input (cost-to-cost) method as costs are incurred. Under the input method, revenue is recognized based on contract costs expended to date relative to total contract costs expected to be incurred. Management exercises significant judgment in determining revenue recognition for these customer contracts as the estimate of the total contract costs expected to be incurred is critical to the recognition of revenue based under the input method.\n\nWe identified the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition of research and development contracts, which are generally accounted for under the input method, to be a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions and judgments used by management in determining the estimated costs expected to be incurred throughout the customer contract. Auditing management’s estimation of cost to be incurred required significant audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the audit evidence obtained.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition of research and development contracts included the following, among others:\n\n●| Tested actual costs incurred, on a sample basis, and the mathematical accuracy of the costs included within the Company’s input (cost-to-cost) method.  \n---|---  \n●| Selected a sample of customer contracts and performed the following procedures:  \n---|---  \n–| Read the underlying contracts and agreed the Company’s total budgeted costs to approved management budgets.  \n---|---  \n–| Evaluated management’s ability to estimate progress towards completion by performing a review of contracts that were completed during the current year or spanned multiple years to determine the accuracy and precision of the Company’s estimation process.  \n---|---  \n–| Evaluated management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total profit by performing corroborating inquiries with Company personnel, including project managers, and comparing the estimates to actual subsequent results.   \n---|---  \n  \n_/s/ RSM US LLP_\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\n\nBoston, Massachusetts\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**KOPIN CORPORATION**\n\n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 5,710,685 | $| 8,258,878  \nRestricted cash | 500,000 | —  \nMarketable debt securities, at fair value | 11,692,000 | 4,388,778  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance of $1,025,000 and $303,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively | 9,706,036 | 6,537,891  \nContract assets and unbilled receivables | 3,409,809 | 4,068,364  \nInventory | 7,601,806 | 6,426,400  \nPrepaid taxes | 85,572 | 105,495  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 1,124,635 | 1,074,867  \nTotal current assets | 39,830,543 | 30,860,673  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | 2,163,417 | 1,831,641  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 2,504,909 | 3,168,520  \nOther assets | 124,925 | 170,132  \nEquity investments | 4,688,522 | 7,721,206  \nTotal assets | $| 49,312,316 | $| 43,752,172  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $| 7,076,759 | $| 5,438,980  \nAccrued payroll and expenses | 1,701,506 | 2,879,139  \nAccrued warranty | 2,160,000 | 1,966,000  \nContract liabilities and billings in excess of revenues earned | 916,826 | 930,500  \nOperating lease liabilities | 651,503 | 786,928  \nAccrued post-retirement benefits | 790,000 | 790,000  \nOther accrued liabilities | 1,702,681 | 1,182,346  \nCustomer deposits | 408,156 | —  \nDeferred tax liabilities | 470,884 | 482,739  \nTotal current liabilities | 15,878,315 | 14,456,632  \nNoncurrent contract liabilities and asset retirement obligations | 278,112 | 248,284  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion | 1,832,982 | 2,576,883  \nAccrued post-retirement benefits, net of current portion | 319,996 | 1,110,000  \nOther long-term liabilities, net of current portion | 1,494,016 | 1,369,758  \nTotal liabilities | 19,803,421 | 19,761,557  \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 11) | -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As used in these notes, the terms \"we,” \"us,” \"our,” \"Kopin” and the \"Company” mean Kopin Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.\n\n_Fiscal Year_\n\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 includes 52 weeks, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 includes 53 weeks, and the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021 includes 52 weeks, and are referred to as fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, herein.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 include the accounts of Kopin Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kopin Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries and a majority owned 80% subsidiary, eMDT America, Inc., located in California (collectively the Company). In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 20% interest in eMDT America, Inc. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of which is allocated to the shareholders of the equity interests not owned by the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe Company has incurred net losses of $19.7 million and $19.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and net cash outflows from operations of $15.3 million and $17.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company’s net cash outflows from operations were partially a result of funding its ongoing investments in research and development, which management believes will continue, production inefficiencies resulting from intermittent supply chain disruptions and litigation costs. Management has implemented certain plans to reduce cash outflows including operational improvements and the curtailment of certain development programs, both of which are expected to preserve cash. The litigation is discussed in Note 12. In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold 3.1 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $7.3 million. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, along with the net proceeds received in the first quarter of 2024 will be adequate to satisfy its current operating plans for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company has in the past sold equity securities through at-the-market equity offerings and in the traditional fashion of significant equity offerings. Nonetheless, management monitors the capital markets on an ongoing basis and may consider raising capital if favorable market conditions develop. If the Company’s actual results are less than projected or the Company needs to raise capital for additional liquidity, the Company may be required to do additional equity financings, reduce expenses, or enter into a strategic transaction. However, management can make no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital, reduce expenses sufficiently, or enter into a strategic transaction on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s product and license and other revenues are derived from the sales of components and subassemblies and the license of intellectual property for use in defense and industrial applications. The Company also has development contracts for the design, manufacture and or modification of products for the U.S. Government or prime contractors for the U.S. Government and for customers that expect to sell into the defense markets. The Company may offer technologies developed under these defense research and development contracts in products sold to industrial, medical and consumer markets. The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR”) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer.\n\nThe Company’s fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government or other customers may result in revenue recognized in excess of amounts currently billed. The Company discloses the excess of revenues over amounts actually billed as Contract assets and unbilled receivables on the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. In some instances, the U.S. Government retains a small portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. The portion of the payments retained until the final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For contracts with the U.S. Government and some commercial customers, the Company typically receives interim payments either as work progresses or by achieving certain milestones or based on a schedule in the contract. The Company recognizes a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned on the consolidated balance sheets. The advanced payment typically is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect the Company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For industrial and consumer purchase orders, the Company typically receives payments within 30 to 60 days of shipment of the product, although for some purchase orders, the Company may require an advanced payment prior to shipment of the product.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nTo determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts with the same customer, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. For most of the Company’s development contracts and contracts with the U.S. Government, the customer contracts with the Company to provide a significant service of integrating a set of components into a single unit. Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. Less frequently, however, the Company may promise to provide distinct goods or services within a contract in which case the Company separates the contract into more than one performance obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. In cases where the Company sells standard products, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\n\nFor certain contracts with the U.S. Government, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs because of continuous transfer of control to the customer and the lack of an alternative use for the product. The continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by liability clauses in the contract that allow the U.S. Government to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay the Company for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. For contracts with commercial customers, while the contract may have a similar liability clause, the Company’s products historically have an alternative use and thus, revenue is recognized at a point in time.\n\nIn situations where control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation for its contracts because the Company believes it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\n\nAccounting for design, development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. The Company has to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by the Company’s subcontractors. For contract change orders, claims or similar items, the Company applies judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization. These amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. If the Company’s estimate of total contract costs or its determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect, the Company’s revenue could be overstated or understated and the profits or loss reported could be subject to adjustment.\n\nFor the Company’s commercial customers, revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer is satisfied and the Company transfers control of the products or services, which is generally upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is recorded as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Provisions for product returns and allowances are reductions in the transaction price and are recorded in the same period as the related revenues. The Company analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances. Certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products. Sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors’ customers and not for stocking inventory. Sales, value add and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe rights and benefits to the Company’s intellectual property are conveyed to certain customers through technology license agreements. These agreements may include other performance obligations including the sale of product to the customer. When the license is distinct from other obligations in the agreement, the Company treats the license and other performance obligations as separate performance obligations. Accordingly, the license is recognized at a point in time or over time based on the standalone selling price. The sale of materials is recognized at a point in time which occurs with the transfer of control of the Company’s products or services. In certain instances, the Company is entitled to sales-based royalties under license agreements. These sales-based royalties are recognized when they are earned. Revenues from sales-based royalties under license agreements are shown under License and other revenues on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Contract Assets_\n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized from customer arrangements, including licensing, exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. The Company classifies the noncurrent portion of contract assets under Other assets in its consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Contract Liabilities_\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized for the contract.\n\n_Performance Obligations_\n\nThe Company’s revenue recognition related to performance obligations that were satisfied at a point in time and over time were as follows:\n\nSchedule of Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\n\nFiscal year ended | 2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nPoint in time | 34| % | 22| % | 31| %  \nOver time | 66| % | 78| % | 69| %  \n  \nThe value of remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ”)). As of December 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $25.9 million, which the Company expects to recognize revenue over the next 12 months. The remaining performance obligations represent amounts to be earned under government contracts, which are subject to cancellation.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Research and Development Costs_\n\nResearch and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display product development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. Research and development costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of experimental display products, and overhead, and are expensed immediately.\n\n_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n\nRestricted cash of approximately $0.5 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2023, and represents cash deposited by the Company into a separate account and designated as collateral for a standby letter of credit in the same amount in accordance with a contractual agreement with a vendor.\n\n_Marketable Debt Securities_\n\nMarketable debt securities consist primarily of commercial paper, medium-term corporate notes, and U.S. Government and agency-backed securities. The Company classifies these marketable debt securities as available-for-sale at fair value in \"Marketable debt securities, at fair value” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on marketable debt securities in the results of operations.\n\nThe Company uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining cost and calculating realized gains and losses with respect to marketable debt securities. The gross gains and losses realized related to sales and maturities of marketable debt securities were not material during the fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_\n\nFinancial instruments consist of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable and certain current liabilities. These assets (excluding marketable securities which are recorded at fair value) and liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n_Inventory_\n\nInventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for the estimated difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required. Inventory write-downs are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.\n\nInventory consists of the following at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Inventory\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nRaw materials | $| 4,785,197 | $| 4,285,757  \nWork-in-process | 2,018,421 | 1,735,454  \nFinished goods | 798,188 | 405,189  \nTotal | $| 7,601,806 | $| 6,426,400  \n  \n55  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Property, Plant and Equipment_\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements and leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement or equipment. As discussed below, obligations for asset retirement are accrued at the time property, plant and equipment is initially purchased or as such obligations are generated from use.\n\n_Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities_\n\nThe Company periodically makes equity investments in private companies, accounted for as an equity investment, whose values are difficult to determine. The Company uses the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values which is often referred to as cost method investments. When assessing investments in private companies for impairment, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. Because these are private companies that the Company does not control, the Company may not be able to obtain all of the information the Company would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis. Accordingly, the Company’s estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date.\n\n_Product Warranty_\n\nThe Company generally sells products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to the Company’s products. The Company accrues for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and accrues for estimated incurred but unidentified issues based on historical activity.\n\n_Extended Warranties_\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from an extended warranty on the straight-line method over the life of the extended warranty, which is typically 12 to 18 months beyond the standard 12-month warranty. The Company classifies the current portion of extended warranties under Contract liabilities and billings in excess of revenue earned and the noncurrent portion of extended warranties under Noncurrent contract liabilities and asset retirement obligations in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company had approximately less than $10,000 of contract liabilities related to extended warranties at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n_Asset Retirement Obligations_\n\nThe Company recorded asset retirement obligations (\"ARO”) liabilities of $0.3 million and $0.2 million at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This represents the legal obligations associated with the retirement of the Company’s assets when the timing and/or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. Changes in ARO liabilities for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Changes in Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nBeginning balance | $| 242,094 | $| 267,970  \nExchange rate change | 12,586 | (25,876| )  \nEnding balance | $| 254,680 | $| 242,094  \n  \n56  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe 2017 Act imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (\"GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred.\n\n_Foreign Currency_\n\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated from the functional currency into U.S. dollars at year end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are accumulated as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains or losses are recognized in income or loss in the period in which they occur.\n\n_Net Loss Per Share_\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period less any unvested restricted shares. Diluted net loss per share is calculated using weighted-average shares outstanding and contingently issuable shares, less weighted-average shares reacquired during the period. The net outstanding shares are adjusted for the dilutive effect of shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Company’s common stock equivalents, which consist of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock.\n\nThe following were not included in weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted because they are anti-dilutive:\n\nSchedule of Anti-dilutive Securities Excluded from Computation of Earnings Per Share\n\n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---  \nNonvested restricted common stock | 1,931,767 | 1,965,901 | 2,077,592  \n  \n_Concentration of Credit Risk_\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk other than marketable securities consist principally of trade accounts receivable. Trade receivables are primarily derived from sales to manufacturers of consumer electronic devices and wireless components or defense applications. The Company sells its products to customers worldwide and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains a reserve for potential credit losses.\n\nThe Company primarily invests its excess cash in government-backed and corporate debt securities that management believes to be of high creditworthiness, which bear lower levels of relative credit risk. The Company relies on rating agencies to ascertain the creditworthiness of its marketable securities and, where applicable, guarantees made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company.\n\n_Other-than-Temporary Impairments_\n\nThe Company conducts a review of its marketable debt securities on a quarterly basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI”). The Company assesses whether OTTI is present when the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if the Company intends to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; (2) if it is \"more likely than not” the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis.\n\n57  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe Company further estimates the amount of OTTI resulting from a decline in the creditworthiness of the issuer (credit-related OTTI) and the amount of non-credit-related OTTI. Non-credit-related OTTI can be caused by such factors as market illiquidity. Credit-related OTTI is recognized in earnings while non-credit-related OTTI on securities not expected to be sold is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not record any OTTI for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n_Stock-Based Compensation_\n\nThe fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is generally the quoted price of the Company’s equity shares on the date of grant. The nonvested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for periods ranging from one to five years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or market conditions. The performance criteria primarily consist of the achievement of established milestones. For nonvested restricted common stock awards which solely require the recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For nonvested restricted common stock awards which require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the service period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The Company recognizes compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for time vested awards.\n\n_Comprehensive Loss_\n\nComprehensive loss is the total of net (loss) income and all other non-owner changes in equity including such items as unrealized holding (losses) gains on marketable equity and debt securities classified as available-for-sale and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustment | Unrealized holding loss on marketable securities | Reclassifications of loss in net loss on marketable securities | Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  \n---|---|---|---  \nBalance as of December 26, 2020 | $| 1,162,506 | $| 385,447 | $| (63,519| ) | $| 1,484,434  \nChanges during year | (51,736| ) | (17,113| ) | (1,234| ) | (70,083| )  \nBalance as of December 25, 2021 | 1,110,770 | 368,334 | (64,753| ) | 1,414,351  \nChanges during year | (36,478| ) | (201,283| ) | (522| ) | (238,283| )  \nBalance as of December 31, 2022 | 1,074,292 | 167,051 | (65,275| ) | 1,176,068  \nChanges during year | 42,027 | 14,644 | (445| ) | 56,226  \nBalance as of December 30, 2023 | $| 1,116,319 | $| 181,695 | $| (65,720| ) | $| 1,232,294  \n  \n58  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_\n\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Examples of such triggering events applicable to the Company’s assets include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group, or adverse industry or economic trends. If any indicator of impairment exists, the Company would then assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of the asset group can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the Company would estimate the asset group’s fair value using future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset group and adjust the carrying value of the asset group accordingly. Given the Company’s history of negative operating losses and negative operating cash flows, the Company performed a quantitative test of its long-lived assets. Upon completion of its quantitative assessment as of December 30, 2023, the Company has concluded there was no impairment.\n\n_Leases_\n\nThe Company accounts for leases under Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) _2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)_. The Company used the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allows it to carry forward the historical lease classification. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of right-of-use assets.\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains an embedded lease at inception. For lease arrangements with both lease and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), the Company accounts for the non-lease components separately.\n\nAll of the Company’s leases are operating leases. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and is reduced for any unrestricted incentives received at or before the commencement date.\n\nFor the majority of the Company’s leases, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date, as the implicit rate is not readily determinable. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term. For new or renewed leases, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.\n\nSome of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company includes these options in the recognition of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. In most cases, the Company has concluded that renewal and early termination options are not reasonably certain of being exercised by the Company (and thus not included in its Right of Use (\"ROU”) asset and lease liability) unless there is an economic, financial or business reason to do so. None of the Company’s leases include variable lease-related payments, such as escalation clauses based on the consumer price index (\"CPI”) rates or residual guarantees.\n\n59  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Following the release of ASU 2019-10 in November 2019, the new effective date, as long as the Company remains a smaller reporting company, would be annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2023 and there was not a material impact.\n\n**2. Property, Plant and Equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Property Plant and Equipment\n\nUseful Life | 2023 | 2022  \n---|---|---  \nEquipment | 3-5 years | $| 14,025,078 | $| 13,965,126  \nLeasehold improvements  | Life of the lease | 3,631,518 | 3,600,557  \nFurniture and fixtures | 3 years | 165,636 | 174,622  \nEquipment under construction | 957,915 | 550,219  \nProperty, plant and equipment, gross | 18,780,147 | 18,290,524  \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization | (16,616,730| ) | (16,458,883| )  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | $| 2,163,417 | $| 1,831,641  \n  \nDepreciation expense for fiscal year 2023 was approximately $0.6 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n**3. Leases**\n\nThe Company enters into operating leases primarily for manufacturing, engineering, research, administration and sales facilities, and information technology (\"IT”) equipment. At December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases. Almost all of the Company’s future lease commitments, and related lease liability, relate to the Company’s facility leases. Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company impaired its Operating lease right-of-use assets related to the Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. discussed in Note 5 Financial Instruments.\n\nSchedule of Lease Expense\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nOperating lease cost | $| 865,377 | $| 985,967  \n  \n60  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nAt December 30, 2023, the Company’s future lease payments under non-cancellable leases were as follows:\n\nSchedule of Future Lease Payment Under Non-cancellable Lease\n\n2024 | $| 795,884  \n---|---|---  \n2025 | 639,373  \n2026 | 604,000  \n2027 | 604,000  \n2028 | 201,333  \nThereafter | —  \nTotal future lease payments | 2,844,590  \nLess imputed interest | (360,105| )  \nTotal | $| 2,484,485  \n  \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n\nSchedule of Supplemental Information Related To Leases\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities | $| 983,289 | $| 993,633  \n  \nOther information related to leases was as follows:\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nWeighted Average Discount Rate—Operating Leases | 6.21| % | 5.94| %  \nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term—Operating Leases (in years) | 4.04 | 4.69  \n  \n**4.

Financial Instruments**\n\n_Fair Value Measurements_\n\nFinancial instruments are categorized as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 based upon the method by which their fair value is computed. An investment is categorized as Level 1 when its fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An investment is categorized as Level 2 if its fair market value is based on quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, or derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. An investment is categorized as Level 3 if its fair value is based on assumptions developed by the Company about what a market participant would use in pricing the assets.\n\nThe following table details the fair value measurements of the Company’s financial assets:\n\nSchedule of Fair Value Measurements of Financial Assets\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement at December 30, 2023 Using:  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 5,079,605 | $| 5,079,605 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | 4,474,375 | — | 4,474,375 | —  \nCertificates of deposit | 7,717,625 | 7,717,625 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 4,688,522 | 174,178 | — | 4,514,344  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 21,960,127 | $| 12,971,408 | $| 4,474,375 | $| 4,514,344  \n  \n62  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement at December 31, 2022 Using:  \nTotal | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3  \nCash equivalents | $| 5,933,386 | $| 5,933,386 | $| — | $| —  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | 2,397,730 | — | 2,397,730 | —  \nCorporate debt | 1,500,445 | — | 1,500,445 | —  \nCertificates of deposit | 490,603 | 490,603 | — | —  \nEquity Investments | 7,721,206 | 213,016 | — | 7,508,190  \nFinancial instruments, owned, at fair value | $| 18,043,370 | $| 6,637,005 | $| 3,898,175 | $| 7,508,190  \n  \nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Initial measurement of equity investments occurs when an observable price for the equity investment is available. The Company adopted the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values (often referred to as cost method investments) on a prospective basis. As a result, these investments will be revalued upon occurrence of an observable price change for similar investments and for impairments. The Company has limited, if any, control over their governance, financial reporting and operations. The Company relies on the financial reporting provided by these investments in order to evaluate them for possible impairment. As a result, the Company faces certain operating, financial and other risks relating to these investments, including risks related to the financial strength of the investments.\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (\"LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with its Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. The technology license agreement provides for Kopin to transfer certain patents to LST if LST achieves certain milestones, however upon transfer Kopin will receive a license to the technology. To the extent LST makes improvements to the technology licensed from Kopin, Kopin will receive a license for these improvements for certain markets. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to LST. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of products that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President and CEO and former Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is the Founder of LST. As a result of this transaction, in 2022 the Company wrote off the two operating lease assets associated with facilities used for the development of the Company’s organic light emitting diode (OLED) products. The Company has recorded its investment in LST at $0 as of December 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company has an equity interest in a company which it acquired through purchasing capital and contributing certain intellectual property totaling $3.9 million by December 26, 2020. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company reviewed the financial condition of its equity interest in the company and, as a result of valuing the investment through discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, recorded an impairment charge of $2.0 million to reduce the value of its investment. For the years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company recorded approximately $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of unrealized losses on this equity investment, respectively, due to a fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate. As of December 30, 2023, the Company owned an approximate 10% interest in this investment and the carrying value of this equity investment was $1.5 million at December 30, 2023 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company has an investment in RealWear Inc. (RealWear) which had been reduced to $0 due to an impairment analysis. In the first quarter of 2022, RealWear raised additional equity capital and based on an observable price change of the customer’s share prices and terms of the equity sale, the Company remeasured the fair market value of its investment and recorded a gain of $4.7 million. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company made an additional equity investment of $0.5 million. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received shares valued at approximately $0.4 million as payment of royalties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point in an equity transaction, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million to reduce the value of the investment to $2.5 million. As of December 30, 2023, the Company owned an approximate 3.3% interest in this investment.\n\n63  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nOn September 30, 2019 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Solos Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company sold and licensed certain assets of the Company’s SolosTM (\"Solos”) product line and WhisperTM Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction the Company received a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). The Company’s 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing. The Company will also receive a royalty in the single digits on the net sales amount of Solos products for a three-year period, after the commencement of commercial production. The Company has performed the analysis and identified Solos Technology as a variable interest entity that should not be consolidated by Kopin, as Kopin is not the primary beneficiary of the entity. Kopin is not obligated to provide any additional funding support to Solos Inc., and its potential loss exposure is the value of the investment recorded on its books. Based on the price paid for equity by the other 80.0% owners of Solos Inc., volatility based on a peer group and assumptions about the risk-free interest rate, the Company estimated the fair value of its equity holdings at $0.6 million and in 2019 recorded a $0.6 million gain on its investment for this equity transaction as the basis of assets transferred was zero. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and other factors of the customer and, as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.2 million to reduce its investment in the customer to $0.2 million. The investment balance is $0.2 million as of December 30, 2023.\n\n_Marketable Debt Securities_\n\nThe Company’s corporate debt consists of floating rate notes with a maturity that is over multiple years but has interest rates that are reset every three months based on the then-current three-month London Interbank Offering Rate (\"three-month Libor”). The Company validates the fair market values of the financial instruments above by using discounted cash flow models, obtaining independent pricing of the securities or through the use of a model that incorporates the three-month Libor, the credit default swap rate of the issuer and the bid and ask price spread of the same or similar investments which are traded on several markets. The restricted cash balance at December 30, 2023 is invested in a certificate of deposit and is classified as a Corporate debt available-for-sale marketable debt security. Investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities are as follows at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\nSchedule of Available-for-sale Marketable Debt Securities\n\nAmortized Cost | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value  \n---|---|---  \n2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | $| 4,500,030 | $| 2,500,006 | $| (25,655| ) | $| (102,276| ) | $| 4,474,375 | $| 2,397,730  \nCorporate debt | 7,750,174 | 2,000,012 | (32,549| ) | (8,964| ) | 7,717,625 | 1,991,048  \nTotal  | $| 12,250,204 | $| 4,500,018 | $| (58,204| ) | $| (111,240| ) | $| 12,192,000 | $| 4,388,778  \n  \nThe contractual maturity of the Company’s marketable debt securities is as follows at December 30, 2023:\n\nSchedule of Contractual Maturity\n\nLess than One year | One to Five years | Total  \n---|---|---  \nU.S. Government and agency backed securities | $| 2,989,195 | $| 1,485,180 | $| 4,474,375  \nCorporate debt | 4,240,445 | 3,477,180 | 7,717,625  \nTotal | $| 7,229,640 | $| 4,962,360 | $| 12,192,000  \n  \n**6. Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation**\n\n_Registered Sale of Equity Securities_\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company sold 2.4 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $16 million (average of $6.66 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.5 million pursuant to the Company’s At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated as of February 8, 2019 (the \"Previous ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, (\"Stifel”) as agent. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company sold 0.1 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.8 million (average of $6.74 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.1 million under the Previous ATM Agreement. The Previous ATM Agreement has since terminated pursuant to its terms as a result of the sale of all the shares subject to such agreement. On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a new At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the \"Current ATM Agreement”) with Stifel under which the Company may sell up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company sold 0.6 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $4.8 million (average of $8.06 per share), before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of $0.1 million under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company sold 1.5 million shares of common stock and 0.2 million shares of treasury stock for gross proceeds of $2.1 million (average of $1.26 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of less than $0.1 million and in the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold 675,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $0.9 million (average of $1.27 per share) before deducting broker expenses paid by the Company of less than $0.1 million, pursuant to the Current ATM Agreement. The net proceeds from the sale of common shares were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the Company sold 17 million shares of registered common stock and issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $0.99 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of $22.9 million before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses paid by the Company of $1.5 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. At December 30, 2023, the Company had available $41.4 million for sale of common stock under the Current ATM Agreement.\n\n_Sale of Treasury Stock_\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 126,389 shares of its common stock for approximately $0.2 million through the sale of shares under its At The Market Offering Agreement, dated March 5, 2021. Commissions paid were less than $10,000.\n\n64  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n_Restricted Stock Awards_\n\nIn 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Equity Plan”) which authorized the issuance of shares of common stock to employees, certain consultants and advisors who perform services for the Company, and non-employee members of the Board. The 2020 Equity Plan is a successor to the Company’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2010 Equity Plan”). The number of shares authorized under the 2020 Equity Plan was 4,000,000 shares of common stock, which has since been amended to authorize the issuance of 11,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, shares of common stock underlying any outstanding award granted under the 2010 Equity Plan that expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of such shares shall be available for the award of new Grants under this Plan. As of December 30, 2023, the Company has approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Equity Plan.\n\nThe fair value of non-vested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed by the Company for periods ranging from one to five years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria or the Company’s stock achieving a certain price. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that solely require the recipient to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved, the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the anticipated service period. If the performance criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\n\nSchedule of Non-vested Restricted Stock Activity\n\nShares | Weighted Average Grant Fair Value  \n---|---  \nBalance at December 25, 2021 | 2,077,592 | $| 2.90  \nGranted | 1,013,600 | 1.33  \nForfeited | (444,350| ) | 2.45  \nVested | (680,941| ) | 2.82  \nBalance at December 31, 2022 | 1,965,901 | 2.22  \nGranted | 3,423,531 | 1.58  \nForfeited | (1,089,773| ) | 2.52  \nVested | (2,367,892| ) | 1.62  \nBalance at December 30, 2023 | 1,931,767 | $| 1.65  \n  \nOn December 31, 2020 (fiscal year 2021), the Company amended the employment agreement with its former CEO, and as part of the amendment issued five tranches of 188,000 shares of restricted stock grants. The Company used a Monte Carlo model to determine the estimated fair value of the awards. Total compensation expense resulting from the awards is approximately $2.1 million. The Company’s stock price met the required levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the total stock compensation expense was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

The total amount of the Company’s gross tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a ‘more likely than not’ threshold amounts to $0.4 million as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company’s policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to include these amounts as a component of income tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits was $1.0 million as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nNet operating losses were not utilized in 2023, 2022 and 2021 to offset federal and state taxes.\n\n67  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe actual income tax provisions reported from operations are different from those which would have been computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate to loss before income tax provision.

Deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:\n\nSchedule of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nFiscal Year  \n2023 | 2022  \nDeferred tax liability:  \nForeign withholding liability | $| (471,000| ) | $| (483,000| )  \nDeferred tax assets:  \nFederal net operating loss carryforwards | 49,213,000 | 46,618,000  \nState net operating loss carryforwards | 7,881,000 | 7,381,000  \nForeign net operating loss carryforwards | 1,183,000 | 942,000  \nEquity awards | 37,000 | 34,000  \nTax credits | 9,849,000 | 9,854,000  \nR&D expense amortization | 2,316,000 | 1,900,000  \nProperty, plant and equipment | 598,000 | 624,000  \nUnrealized losses on investments | 2,292,000 | 1,406,000  \nInventory reserves | 1,212,000 | 1,119,000  \nOther | 1,587,000 | 1,492,000  \nNet deferred tax assets | 75,697,000 | 70,887,000  \nValuation allowance | (76,168,000| ) | (71,370,000| )  \nDeferred tax assets, net | $| (471,000| ) | $| (483,000| )  \n  \n68  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\nThe valuation allowance was approximately $76.2 million and $71.4 million at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily driven by U.S. net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs”) and tax credits that the Company does not believe will ultimately be realized.\n\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company has available for tax purposes NOLs of $122.7 million expiring in 2023 through 2038 and $111.7 million that have an unlimited carryover period. The Company has recognized a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets as the Company has concluded that such assets are not more likely than not to be realized.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. income taxes.\n\nUnder the provisions of Section 382, certain substantial changes in Kopin’s ownership may limit in the future the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be used annually to offset future taxable income and income tax liability.\n\nThe Company’s income tax returns have not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service and are subject to examination for all years since 2002. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states.\n\nInternational jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to twenty years after filing of the respective return. Years still open to examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Korea (2011 onward), Japan (2011 onward), Hong Kong (2013 onward) and the United Kingdom (2016 onward). The Company is not currently under examination in these jurisdictions.\n\n**9. Accrued Warranty**\n\nThe Company warrants its products against defect for 12 months, however, for certain products a customer may purchase an extended warranty. A provision for estimated future costs and estimated returns for credit relating to such warranty is recorded in the period when product is shipped and revenue is recognized and is updated as additional information becomes available. The Company’s estimate of future costs to satisfy warranty obligations is based primarily on historical warranty expense experienced and a provision for potential future product failures. In 2022, the Company increased its warranty reserves due to quality issues. Changes in the accrued warranty for fiscal years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Accrued Warranty\n\nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 25, 2021  \n---|---|---  \nFiscal Year Ended  \nDecember 30, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 25, 2021  \nBeginning balance | $| 1,966,000 | $| 517,000 | $| 508,000  \nAdditions | 802,000 | 2,329,000 | 791,000  \nClaim and reversals | (608,000| ) | (880,000| ) | (782,000| )  \nEnding Balance | $| 2,160,000 | $| 1,966,000 | $| 517,000  \n  \n**10. Employee Benefit Plan**\n\nThe Company has an employee benefit plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In 2023, the plan allowed employees to defer an amount of their annual compensation up to a current maximum of $22,500 if they are under the age of 50 and $30,000 if they are over the age of 50. The Company matches 50% of all deferred compensation on the first 6% of each employee’s deferred compensation. The amount charged to operations in connection with this plan was approximately $0.3 million in fiscal year 2023 and $0.4 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n69  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n**11. Commitments**\n\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\n\n**12. Litigation**\n\nThe Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period.\n\n_BlueRadios, Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.):_\n\nOn August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. (\"BlueRadios”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (\"the Court”), alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning an alleged joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as \"Golden-i” breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. § 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleges that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios’ employees as inventors and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees.\n\nOn October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15, 2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S. Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, punitive damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications, and denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and 5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. Additional factual and expert discovery ordered by the Court has been completed. A trial date has been set by the Court for March 20, 2024. The Company has not concluded a loss from this matter is probable; therefore, the Company has not recorded an accrual for litigation or claims related to this matter as of December 30, 2023. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n**13.

In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies the Company needs to purchase from affiliates in order to enhance its product offering.\n\nThe Company and RealWear, Inc. (\"RealWear”) have entered into agreements where the Company has agreed to supply display modules to RealWear, and license certain intellectual property to RealWear. In conjunction with these agreements the Company received an equity interest in RealWear, one-time $1.5 million license fees and will receive royalties of future product sales. In May 2019, the Company signed an additional agreement to license certain intellectual property to Realwear for a $3.5 million license fee and additional sales-based royalties. Of the $3.5 million license fee, $2.5 million was paid upon signing of the license agreement and the other $1.0 million was paid in quarterly installments of $0.25 million. See Note 5 for a description of the Company’s investments in RealWear. As of December 30, 2023, the Company owned approximately 3.3% of RealWear.\n\nOn September 30, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Solos Purchase Agreement”) with Solos Technology Limited (\"Solos Technology”). Pursuant to the Solos Purchase Agreement, the Company sold and licensed to Solos Technology certain assets of its SolosTM (\"Solos”) product line and WhisperTM Audio (\"Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction the Company received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology’s parent company, Solos Incorporation (\"Solos Inc.”). In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Solos Technology for sales support provided. Solos Technology has agreed to reimburse the Company for the employee’s time spent on Solos development.

If the Board or an authorized committee determines that any such performance-based compensation would have been at a lower amount had it been based on the restated financial results, the Company will, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment from such officer of the portion of such performance-based compensation that is greater than that which would have been awarded or earned had such compensation been calculated on the basis of the restated financial results.\n"
