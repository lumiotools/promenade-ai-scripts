Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation adjustments._  \n  \n**_Management Comments_**\n\n\"The third quarter presented ongoing challenges for InMode,\" said Moshe Mizrahy, Chief Executive Officer. \"Macroeconomic conditions led to a decrease in demand for our consumables and new platform sales, while the launch of our latest platforms required extended adjustments to our production lines. Nevertheless, we believe our recent management changes will better align our operations with our strategic plan. We also take pride in our dedicated employees, whose hard work has allowed us to make faster-than-expected progress in fulfilling pre-orders.\"\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nTotal GAAP revenues for the third quarter of 2024 reached $130.2 million (including $31.9 million in revenue from first half of 2024 pre-orders), an increase of 5.8% compared to $123.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\"Despite continued headwinds in the third quarter, we are pleased to have fulfilled our pre-orders ahead of schedule, allowing us to focus on execution once market demand recovers,\" said Yair Malca, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nGAAP and *non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 82% compared to a gross margin of 84% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 37%, compared to an operating margin of 38% in the third quarter of 2023. *Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 40% compared to 43% for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses, primarily driven by our recent management changes costs, higher commissions, as well as additional investments in trade shows and workshop activities.\n\nInMode reported GAAP net income of $51.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $46.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. On a *non-GAAP basis, InMode reported net income of $55.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $53.1 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_2024 Financial Outlook_**\n\nManagement provided an outlook for the full year of 2024 ending December 31, 2024. Based on our current estimates, management expects:\n\n  * Full Year 2024 revenue to be between $410 to $420 million compared to prior guidance of $430 million to $440 million\n  * *Non-GAAP gross margin between 81% and 82% compared to prior guidance of 82% - 84%\n  * *Non-GAAP income from operations to be between $140 million and $145 million compared to prior guidance of $150 million to $155 million\n  * *Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share remains the same as in previous guidance at $1.92 to $1.96 after taking into consideration the estimated shares that will be repurchased as part of the share repurchase programs announced this year\n\n\n\n_This outlook is not a guarantee of future performance, and stockholders should not rely on such forward-looking statements. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for additional information._\n\n_*Please refer to \"Use of non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for important information about non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP Statement of Income is provided following the financial statements that are included in this release. Non-GAAP results exclude share-based compensation adjustments._\n\n**_The Current Situation in Israel_**\n\nRegarding the current situation in Israel, management would like to assure investors that the Company is prioritizing the safety and well-being of its employees, and all its team are safe. However, an inability to promptly receive needed supplies and materials due to the ongoing and unpredictable nature of the conflict in Israel and the surrounding region may adversely impact our ability to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates and products in a timely manner. This could cause several delays and/or issues for our operations, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates and our financial condition.\n\n**_Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nIn addition to InMode's operating results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin. Because these measures are used in InMode's internal analysis of financial and operating performance, management believes they provide investors with greater transparency of its view of InMode's economic performance. Management also believes the presentation of these measures, when analyzed in conjunction with InMode's GAAP operating results, allows investors to more effectively evaluate and compare InMode's performance to that of its peers, although InMode's presentation of its non-GAAP measures may not be strictly comparable to the similarly titled measures of other companies. Schedules reconciling each of these non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to this release.\n\n**_Conference Call Information_**\n\nMr. Moshe Mizrahy, Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Michael Kreindel, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer and Mr. Yair Malca, Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call today, October 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nThe Company encourages participants to **pre-register for the conference call using the following link** : \n\n<https://dpregister.com/sreg/10193479/fdae439271>.\n\nCallers will receive a unique dial-in number upon registration, which enables immediate access to the call.

The items impacted were \"Investment in short-term deposits\" and \"Proceeds from short-term deposits\" which were decreased by $41,000 and $119,000 for the three months and nine months ended September 30,2023 respectively and \"Purchase of marketable securities\" and \"Proceeds from maturity of marketable securities\" which were decreased by $0, and $40,423 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThese changes have no impact on our previously reported consolidated total cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities in the periods stated above as well as net income and net change in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company evaluated the materiality of the adjustments, individually and in the aggregate, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, and concluded that it was immaterial to the Company's prior periods' consolidated financial information. Since the revision was not material to any prior interim period or annual consolidated financial statements, no amendments to previously filed interim or annual periodic financial information was required. Consequently, the Company has revised the historical consolidated financial information presented herein for the impact of the above.\n\n**INMODE LTD.** CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (U.S. dollars in thousands, except for per share data) (Unaudited)  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30,** | **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Revenues by Category:**  \nCapital Equipment revenues -

(Nasdaq: [INMD](#financial-modal)), a leading global provider of innovative medical technologies, has been granted a preliminary injunction by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in a lawsuit filed against sellers identified to be the source of unlawful counterfeit sales of Morpheus8 radiofrequency devices and cartridge accessories. \n\n[Continue Reading ](#continue-jump)\n\n[![InMode Granted Preliminary Injunction Against Online Sellers Prohibiting Counterfeit Sales of Morpheus8 Radiofrequency Devices and Cartridge Accessories](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2538946/image001.jpg?w=600)](#)\n\nInMode Granted Preliminary Injunction Against Online Sellers Prohibiting Counterfeit Sales of Morpheus8 Radiofrequency Devices and Cartridge Accessories \n\nOn September 3, 2024, the Honorable Michael Fitzgerald of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued the order granting InMode's motion for a preliminary injunction. InMode's large-scale action against these illegitimate sellers also warranted a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), which was granted due to strong supporting evidence that it is within the public interest to protect InMode's trademarks and prevent the sale of counterfeit products, particularly in this case, where Defendants' counterfeit Morpheus8 products could be sold to unsuspecting third parties for use in medical procedures. As a result, a court-ordered preliminary injunction has been issued, freezing various assets, and account listings of all sellers involved in the sale of the aforementioned counterfeit goods.\n\n\"InMode has zero tolerance for dishonest business practices and considers the safety of the public its number one priority,\" said Moshe Mizrahy, CEO of InMode. \"We will take necessary action with online platforms and sellers participating in the irresponsible use, sale or distribution of our brand and counterfeit products associated with it.\"\n\nInMode will continue to relentlessly pursue enforcement against sellers of counterfeit InMode products and Morpheus8 devices and accessories to address the harm and adverse reactions caused by counterfeit Morpheus8 devices. In the United States, patients can confirm they are receiving top-quality care from an InMode provider using a genuine Morpheus8 device by finding an authorized provider at [www.inmodemd.com/find-a-provider](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4285488-1&h=2887020987&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inmodemd.com%2Ffind-a-provider&a=www.inmodemd.com%2Ffind-a-provider).\n\n**About InMode**\n\nInMode is a leading global provider of innovative medical technologies.
