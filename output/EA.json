These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items\nassociated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not\nreflect a comprehensive system of accounting and differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP\nfinancial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures exclude acquisition-related expenses, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related charges, and\ncapital expenditures, as applicable in any given reporting period and our outlook. The Company may consider whether other significant items\nthat arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide investors with additional useful information to better understand and evaluate the Company’s operating results and future\nprospects because they exclude certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core business, operating results, or future outlook.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, with further adjustments are used by management to understand ongoing financial and business\nperformance.\nThe Company uses a tax rate of 19% internally to evaluate its operating performance and to forecast, plan, and analyze future periods.\nAccordingly, the Company applies the same tax rate to its management reporting financial results.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure."

Good Afternoon.\nEA’s strong fiscal year continues as we again over delivered in the quarter and raised our full\nyear guidance. Our success this quarter, driven by the depth and quality of our portfolio and\ncontent delivered by our amazing teams, highlights the increasing momentum across our\nbusiness and progress against our strategic vision.\nAt our recent investor day, we shared the vision for our company’s role in shaping the future of\nentertainment. We provided more clarity on how we are executing across our three strategic\npillars: creating content and experiences that entertain and engage massive online\ncommunities, telling blockbuster stories, and harnessing the power of community in, around,\nand beyond our games.\nFor the near term, we shared how our creative teams are leveraging our production strength\nand broad portfolio of IP to build and engage some of the biggest online communities on the\nplanet across the modalities of play, create, watch, and connect. We showed how we will tell\nblockbuster stories through bigger worlds, more nuanced characters and deeply innovative\ngameplay. We have an incredible opportunity to extend new modalities of play, introduce new\ntools to create and share, and establish more ways to connect with more players for more time\nacross more geographies to drive meaningful growth in our business.\n2\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nFor the medium term, we shared the first steps we are taking to expand beyond the bounds of\nour games to more deeply engage our current fans and build all new audiences. Considering\nthe size of our community, the depth of their engagement and the strength of our brand, we are\nstarting with EA SPORTS. We shared early looks at how we are leveraging our data,\ntechnology, and expertise to build new tools for simulations and community driven creation as\nwell as new experiences that bring real and virtual sports fandom together in the EA SPORTS\nAPP. As the industry continues its fundamental shift in how fans are consuming content and\ninteracting with their favorite leagues, teams, and players by choosing more social, interactive,\nand immersive experiences, we believe we are well positioned to capture more share of sports\nfandom.\nAnd lastly, for the longer term, we believe generative A.I. has the potential to greatly expand,\ntransform, and create new entertainment experiences. We believe this means all new business\nopportunities rooted in social connection and self-expression. We aspire to accelerate and\nenable creators to build new ways to play, create, watch, and connect that are unimagined\ntoday.\nComing back to this quarter — it was driven by the breadth of our portfolio and the over-\nperformance of our guidance by our sports franchises. The power of EA SPORTS comes from\nour teams’ unique ability to create deep, rich, and highly valuable IP that celebrates the biggest\nsports in the world. Nowhere else can players and fans dive into experiences with the\nexcitement, depth, authenticity, innovation, and quality that our experiences can deliver.\nFor American Football, we set out on a multi-year journey to build a massive online community\nto harness the collective power of American Football fandom and transform the way they\ninteract with North America’s biggest sport. With Madden NFL connecting real world events\n3\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nwith our own community driven moments, we’re extending the in-game experiences to drive\nengagement 365 days a year. And combined with the launch of College Football this quarter,\nwe have seen incredible success expanding our audience. New players into the community\nmore than doubled year over year, and represented around a quarter of the player base.\nThrough September, College Football 25 was not only the best-selling HD title in North America,\nit has also proven to be a wholly unique moment of sports culture, connection, and fandom. The\nimpressive launch with the world’s largest NIL program, support from universities, colleges,\nathletes, partners, and fans, has arguably become one of the biggest moments in American\nsports entertainment so far this year. Each week, conversations from the stadiums to social\nmedia, from broadcast booths to tailgates, from dorm rooms to wherever fans are, we are\nseeing our experience at the epicenter of fandom around the sport.\nThis success demonstrates our strategy at work. Combining College with the long history of our\nsuccess in Madden NFL, we have built the most immersive and deepest American Football\nexperience, making it part of the very fabric of the sport. With new offerings like the MVP\nbundle and connected modes between the titles, we have seen incredible engagement in our\nAmerican Football community. We have more players than ever immersed in the sport: for\nexample, total hours played in Q2 are up over 140% year over year, demonstrating fans are\nplaying both games. And we are just getting started. As you saw at Investor Day, you should\nexpect us to continue adding new connections, more modalities, more creative tools and new\ncommunity spaces beyond the field of play to continue the momentum well into the future.\nNow, switching to EA SPORTS FC.\n4\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nAs EA SPORTS FC enters its second year, the platform is thriving as both interactive\nentertainment and as a global influencer across the world’s game. On a trailing 12 month basis,\nEA SPORTS FC is the largest franchise in the Western world. With FC Mobile and FC Online,\nwe have a truly global platform as we reach over 130% more players worldwide. These\nhundreds of millions of players across multiple entry points have joined the club— finding joy,\ncompetition, inspiration, and a celebration of culture and fandom along the way. We are meeting\nfans wherever they are on different platforms, across geographies and business models. As\nsuch, we continue to drive deep engagement across our titles and saw live services net\nbookings growth in the quarter year over year.\nWe believe FC 25 is a major step forward as we build towards the future of interactive football\nfandom. In addition to advancing all the hallmarks of an EA SPORTS experience — unrivaled\ngameplay, immersion, and authenticity - FC 25 is taking an incredible leap forward in social play\nwith RUSH and new creator tools like Highlighter.\nThe deeply social, 5v5 RUSH experience is loved by new and old players alike. It’s been a\npreferred way to play by more than half of our veteran players. We also believe it’s driving\nUltimate Team engagement, especially those playing with friends. Matches played with friends\nhave more than doubled year over year. We’ve witnessed that when friends play together, we\nsee deeper engagement for longer with a positive impact on monetization, and while it’s early\nwith FC 25, these trends are continuing.\nThis quarter across both American Football and Global Football, we are making great progress\nacross our strategy of building connected ecosystems, tools for creativity, and new modalities of\nplay to continue to build massive online communities. We are also able to leverage the scale,\ntechnology and breadth of our teams’ capability to build the most authentic experiences across\n5\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nthe broader sports world. This month saw the launch of NHL 25 with enhanced gameplay\npowered by a new technology called ICE-Q that delivers the most authentic hockey experience\nto date.\nOur incredible portfolio of EA SPORTS experiences engage and connect hundreds of millions of\nfans and sits at the intersection of sports, entertainment, technology, fandom, and\nculture. Across more platforms, more modalities, and more geographies, we’re delivering\ninteractive experiences that reach more fans than anyone else in sports.\nAnd we’re not stopping there…\nWe are building on this momentum, and leaning into harnessing the power of this massive\nglobal community with the EA SPORTS APP. This means more deeply engaging our core fans,\nand welcoming and inspiring an entirely new generation of sports fans too.\nOur upcoming soft launch in Spain will focus on European Football, and benefit from our\npartnership with LALIGA. Our unique positioning in bridging real world sports with interactive\nentertainment sets us apart to be able to build a feature rich app combining sports content such\nas highlights, interactive live data and social features. And we’re able to start from a position of\nstrength, with our EA SPORTS audience that numbers in the hundreds of millions. Global\nFootball is just the beginning – we plan to introduce more sports in more regions in the future,\nthrough a scaled release cadence – with data from each release helping to define deeply\nengaging future features. This marks a big step forward in our vision to make EA SPORTS the\nmost valuable sports business on the planet.\nIn the quarter, Season 22 in Apex Legends launched with significantly more new features for\ncasual and seasoned players alike, including more modes, a new map, and new anti-cheat\n6\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nsoftware. Following changes to the Battle Pass construct, we did not see the lift in monetization\nwe had expected. Two things have become clear in the free-to-play FPS category. First, in a\ncompetitive landscape where brand, a strong core player base, and high quality mechanics\nmatter more than ever, Apex has proven to be a compelling franchise for us and an industry\nstalwart. Second, to drive significant growth and re-engagement, large systematic change is\nrequired. We will continue to focus on retention and breadth of content in service of our global\ncommunity as we work towards more significant, innovative changes in the future.\nTurning to The Sims Universe:\nIt’s been nearly 25 years since the world was first introduced to this beloved franchise. Since\nthen, more than 500 million have joined the community.\nAs we outlined at Investor Day, The Sims will move beyond linear, sequential releases with the\ngoal to offer more options for players to engage with the brand than ever before. We started\nwith rebuilding, re-engineering, and reimagining The Sims 4. Building The Sims 4 as the\nfoundation of the franchise enables our players to continue to engage with the content they’ve\ncollected, created, and built over the past decade and engage in new evolving\nexperiences. This allows us to focus on creating a variety of games and experiences — deep\nsimulation games, cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, and mobile narrative\ngames.\nThe Life and Death Expansion Pack in Sims 4 is dropping Oct 31 and early indicators show it’s\ntrending ahead of Episode 16. Starting in November, a new UGX product, The Sims 4 Creator\nKits — designed and built by our community creators — will start rolling out.\n7\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nAlso in November, MySims: Cozy Bundle launches on Nintendo Switch. In The Sims Labs, an\nincubator for testing new innovations and features, players are trying a plethora of new\nideas. These launches and tests this quarter are a core part of how we are investing in a\nmassive Sims platform — across more game experiences, more creative options, and more\nways for players and creators to connect. There’s much more to come for the franchise,\nincluding a film in the works in partnership with Amazon MGM Studios. The Sims represents an\nincredible opportunity as it becomes an even bigger cultural icon and massive online\ncommunity.\nIt’s an amazing time at EA and in two days we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It’s been\nten years since we launched its predecessor, game of the year winner - Dragon Age:\nInquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this\nyear’s action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our\nblockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.\nLooking ahead, I’m excited about what we are building towards over the next six - 12 and 18\nmonths. You should expect more key developments and news around our massive online\ncommunities including Battlefield and skate in the coming quarters.\nOur Q2 results represent momentum in our business as we continue to execute our strategy to\ndrive sustainable long-term growth built across the engagement modalities of play, create,\nwatch and connect.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Stuart for a deeper look into this quarter and our business,\noverall.\n8\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nSTUART CANFIELD:\nThank you, Andrew, and hello everyone.\nBuilding on our momentum from Q1, we delivered a record net bookings for Q2, exceeding the\nhigh end of our guidance range. Our result is a testament to our team's commitment to\ndelivering high-quality experiences that deeply engage and entertain our global communities,\nhighlighted this quarter by the strong performance of our EA SPORTS franchises. As we wrap\nup an incredible first half of the fiscal year, we are raising our FY25 guidance. And as we look to\nthe future, we remain focused on executing the strategic roadmap outlined at our Investor Day,\ndelivering long-term value creation through increased scale to drive top-line growth, improved\nmargins, and greater cash flow.\nNow, turning to the quarter.\nQ2 net bookings was $2.08 billion, up 14% year over year, exceeding our expectations with the\nstrong reception for EA SPORTS College Football 25. This quarter, our net bookings saw\nminimal impact from FX.\nOur full game net bookings was $832 million, up 20% year over year, highlighted by the\nsuccessful expansion of our American Football ecosystem.\nOur live services net bookings was $1.25 billion, up 10% year over year. This strong\nperformance exceeded our expectations, as our American Football Ultimate Team modes\ndelivered engaging entertainment to players across both College Football and Madden NFL.\n9\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nOn a trailing twelve-month basis, live services comprised 74% of our business.\nAs we shared at our Investor Day, a key pillar of our long-term strategy is driving scale in our\nMassive Online Communities. In Q2, we took a major step forward in expanding American\nFootball with the incredibly successful launch of College Football 25 to complement our Madden\nNFL HD and mobile offerings. The strong performance of our MVP Bundle underscores the\npower of an aggregated community and an expanded ecosystem of experiences. As we scale\nthis collective live services business, we have driven significant net bookings growth through\nincreased engagement and the acquisition of new players, with both engagement and overall\nspend more than doubling this quarter on a year over year basis. It’s clear players are enjoying\nboth experiences, and over time we will build an ever-more connected ecosystem.\nMomentum continues in Global Football as we remain on track to grow net bookings in FY25\nover a record prior year. For the quarter, we delivered in line with our expectations as EA\nSPORTS FC 24 strength continued into the lead up to the successful launch of FC 25. In our\nnew HD title, we continue to make progress on delivering engaging experiences, including\nRUSH, and content in our Ultimate Team business. As a result both spender conversion and\nmonetization metrics improved year over year. We also saw positive results beyond HD, as both\nFC Mobile and FC Online saw net bookings growth from increased monetization.\nAs discussed during our Investor Day, Apex Legends net bookings fell short of our expectations\nfor the quarter as we extended freemium access across the entirety of the first half of the\nSeason 22 Battle Pass. Following the second half release of the Battle Pass on September\n17th, we observed a return to spending conversion levels consistent with previous seasons. As\nwe look forward, we have adjusted the rest of FY25 to reflect lower engagement than expected\nversus our prior guidance. As Andrew mentioned, we are committed to delivering new\n10\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nexperiences for our players, with a continued focus on enhancing player engagement and\nretention.\nIn The Sims, we continue to advance the franchise by delivering new player experiences that\ndeeply engage and captivate our community. During the quarter, we launched the Reaper’s\nReward gameplay event, offering players weekly challenges that resulted in a 6% year-over-\nyear increase in weekly active users. This event, coupled with increased engagement\nthroughout the quarter, drove strong player demand for our catalog of content, surpassing our\nexpectations for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to grow our community\nthrough focused updates, new experiences, and user-generated content, starting with Creator\nKits and MySims: Cozy Bundle in November.\nNow, moving to our GAAP quarterly results. We delivered Q2 net revenue of $2.03 billion, up 6%\nyear over year. Gross margins increased 130 basis points, largely a result of higher digital mix\nand lower licensing costs.\nOperating expenses came in below our expectations at $1.19 billion, up 10% year over year,\ndriven largely by expenses related to our February restructuring event and increased people costs\nto support our strategic initiatives.\nEarnings per share was $1.11. As a reminder, in the year ago period, we saw $0.34 one-time\nnon-cash tax benefit.\nWe delivered a record Q2 result for operating cash flow of $234 million, more than double the\nprior year period, primarily due to timing of launches. On a trailing twelve months basis, free\n11\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\ncash flow reached $1.98 billion, underscoring the strength of our business. Please see our\nearnings slides for further cash flow information.\nIn the second quarter, we returned $426 million to stockholders through stock buybacks and\ndividends.\nNow, turning to guidance.\nGiven our strong performance in the first half, we are raising our net bookings guidance range\nfor FY25 to $7.500 billion to $7.800 billion, up 1% to up 5% year over year. Our revised range\nimplies a midpoint that is at the top end of our previous guidance.\nOur net bookings assumptions for the second half of the year are as follows: first, as shared at\nInvestor Day, we continue to expect our American Football business to exceed $1 billion for\nFY25; second, after the successful launch of FC 25, we continue to expect our EA SPORTS FC\nfranchise to grow over a record FY24; third, despite lower expectations for Apex Legends, we\nare on track to maintain mid-single digit growth in our core live services; and fourth, we’re\nmaintaining our assumptions for our upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard launch this week,\nand our partner title, slated to launch in Q4.\nTurning to our FY25 GAAP outlook, we are raising net revenue guidance to $7.400 billion to\n$7.700 billion. We expect cost of revenue to be $1.530 billion to $1.560 billion.\nWe now expect operating expenses to be approximately $4.445 billion to $4.515 billion, up 3%\nto 4% year over year.\n12\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nAs a result, we expect GAAP operating margin to be 19.3% to 21.1%. We expect non-GAAP\noperating margin to be 30.7% to 32.1%. The impact from change in deferred net revenue is\nexpected to be approximately 90 to 80 basis points.\nThis results in a revised earnings per share of $3.82 to $4.33.\nWe are also increasing our operating cash flow guidance to $2.075 billion to $2.275 billion.\nCapital expenditures now are expected to be $225 million. As a result, our free cash flow\nguidance of $1.850 billion to $2.050 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, we had a $150\nmillion cash tax benefit in the prior year.\nIf rates remain unchanged from today, we expect minimal impact to net bookings from FX. For\nmore information on the impact of FX movements, please refer to our earnings slides.\nTurning to Q3, we expect net bookings of $2.400 billion to $2.550 billion, up 1% to up 8% year\nover year, largely driven by the launch of Dragon Age and continued growth in our EA SPORTS\nFC franchise. We expect the performance of our catalog and the impact from sunset mobile\ntitles to be a combined headwind of approximately 3%.\nWe expect net revenue of $1.875 billion to $2.025 billion, cost of revenue to be $450 million to\n$480 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.100 billion to $1.150 billion, resulting\nin earnings per share of $0.85 to $1.02.\nBefore I turn the call over to Andrew, I want to take a moment to reiterate our confidence in our\nlong-term financial framework, which we first introduced earlier this year and expanded upon\nduring our Investor Day. Exiting the first half of fiscal year 25, we have strong momentum,\n13\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nenabling us to raise our full year guidance while also building conviction in our ability to\nsignificantly outperform the market through FY27 for net bookings growth. And, as we drive\nincreased scale in our top-line, we expect material margin expansion from FY25 through FY27\neven as we continue to invest in the future. Our robust framework for long-term value creation\nremains strong and we are dedicated to executing the strategic priorities and initiatives\npresented at our Investor Day.\nIn closing, I also want to take a quick moment to thank those of you who joined us - in person\nand via livestream - for our Investor Day last month. We appreciate your support in our journey\nas we lead the future of entertainment.\nANDREW WILSON:\nIn Q2 we delivered multiple high quality launches and meaningful additions to our live services\nthat drove great strength and momentum across our business. This all means incredible things\nto come as we execute across our long-term strategy.\nAs players increasingly embrace games and experiences to play, create, watch, and connect,\nwe have an incredible opportunity to build and grow more fully connected platforms that deliver\nmore value and less friction for fans everywhere.\nWe are building for this future, today. Our incredible teams, utilizing cutting edge technology,\ncontinues to push the depth and breadth of what is possible in entertainment. As such, we are\nwell-positioned — in service of our people, players, communities, and stockholders — to seize\nour biggest opportunities, and to grow as a global leader in entertainment.\n14\nELECTRONIC ARTS PREPARED REMARKS FY25Q2\nAnd now, Stuart and I are ready to take your questions.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome statements set forth in this release, including the information relating to EA’s expectations\nunder the heading “Business Outlook as of October 29, 2024” and other information regarding\nEA's expectations contain forward-looking statements that are subject to change.

EA's strong fiscal year continues as we again overdelivered in the quarter and raised our full year guidance. Our\nsuccess this quarter driven by the depth and quality of our portfolio and content delivered by our amazing teams highlights the increasing\nmomentum across our business and progress against our strategic vision. At our recent Investor Day, we shared the vision for our company's role\nin shaping the future of entertainment. We provided more clarity on how we are executing across our three strategic pillars.\nCreating content and experiences that entertain and engage massive online communities, telling blockbuster stories and having the power of\ncommunity in around and beyond our games. For the near term, we shared how our creative teams are leveraging our production strength and\nbroad portfolio of IP to build and engage some of the biggest online communities on the planet across the modalities of play, create, watch, and\n2\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We showed how we will tell blockbuster stories through bigger worlds, more nuanced characters and deeply innovative gameplay. We\nhave an incredible opportunity to extend new modalities of play, introduced new tools to create and share and establish more ways to connect\nwith more players for more time across more geographies to drive meaningful growth in our business.\nFor the medium term, we shared the first steps we are taking to expand beyond the bounds of our games to more deeply engage our current fans\nand build new audiences. Considering the size of our community, the depth of our engagement and the strength of our brand, we are starting\nwith EA Sports. We shared early looks at how we are leveraging our data, technology and expertise to build new tools for simulations and\ncommunity-driven creation as well as new experiences that bring real and virtual sports fandom together in the EA Sports app. As the industry\ncontinues its fundamental shift in how fans are consuming content and interacting with their favorite leagues, teams and players by choosing\nmore social, interactive and immersive experiences we believe we are well positioned to capture more share of sports fandom.\nAnd lastly, for the longer term, we believe generative AI has potential to greatly expand, transform and create new entertainment experiences. We\nbelieve this means all new business opportunities rooted in social connection and self-expression. We aspire to accelerate and enable creators to\nbuild new ways to play, create, watch and connect that are unimagined today. Coming back to this quarter, it was driven by the breadth of our\nportfolio and the overperformance of our guidance by our sports franchises.\nThe power of EA Sports comes from our team's unique ability to create deep rich and highly valuable IP that celebrates the biggest sport in the\nworld. Nowhere else can players and fans dive into experiences with the excitement, get authenticity, innovation and quality that our experiences\ncan deliver. For American football, we set out on a multiyear journey to build a massive online community to have the collective power of American\nfootball fandom and transform the way they interact with North America's biggest sport. With Madden NFL connecting real-world events with our\nown community-driven moments, we're extending the in-game experiences to drive engagement 365 days a year.\nAnd combined with the launch of college football this quarter, we have seen incredible success expanding our audience. New players into the\ncommunity more than doubled year-over-year and represented around one-fourth of the player base. Through September, College Football 25\nwas not only the best-selling HD title in North America, it has also proven to be a wholly unique moment of sports culture, connection and fandom.\nThe impressive launch with the world's largest NAL program support from universities, colleges, athletes, partners and fans has arguably become\none of the biggest moments in American sports entertainment so far this year.\nEach week, conversations from a stadium to social media from broadcast boots to tailgates from dorm rooms to wherever fans are, we are seeing\nour experience at the epicenter of fandom around the sport. This success demonstrates our strategy at work, combining college with a long history\nof our success in Madden NFL, we have built the most immersive and deepest American football experience, making it part of the very fabric of\nthe sport. With new offerings like the MVP bundle and connected modes between the titles, we have seen incredible engagement in our American\nfootball community. We have more players than ever immersed in the sport.\nFor example, total hours played in Q2 are up over 140% year-over-year, demonstrating fans are playing both games, and we are just getting started.\nAs you saw at Investor Day, you should expect us to continue adding new connections, more modalities, more creative tools and new community\nspaces beyond the field of play to continue the momentum well into the future. Now switching to EA Sports FC. As EA Sports FC enters its second\nyear, the platform is thriving as both interactive entertainment and as a global influencer across the world's game. On a trailing 12-month basis,\nEA Sports FC is the largest franchise in the Western world.\nWith FC Mobile and FC Online, we have a truly global platform as we reach over 130% more players worldwide. These hundreds of millions of flyers\nacross multiple entry points have joined the club, finding joy, competition, inspiration and celebration of culture and fandom along the way. We\nare meeting fans wherever they are on different platforms across geographies and business models. As such, we continue to drive deep engagement\nacross our titles and saw Live services net bookings growth in the quarter year-over-year.\nWe believe FC 25 is a major step forward as we build towards the future of interactive football founder. In addition to advancing all the hallmarks\nof an EA Sports experience, unrivaled gameplay, immersion and authenticity, FC 25 is taking an incredible leap forward in social play with Rush\nand new creative tools like highlighter. The deeply social 55 rush experience is loved by new and old players alike. It's been a preferred way to play\nby more than half of our veteran players.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Matches play with friends had more than doubled\nyear-over-year. We've witnessed that when friends play together, we see deeper engagement for longer with a positive impact on monetization.\nAnd while it's early with FC 25, these trends are continuing.\nThis quarter, across both American football and global football, we are making great progress across our strategy of building connected ecosystems\ntools for creativity and new modes of play to continue to build massive online communities. We are also able to leverage the scale, technology\nand breadth of our team's capability to build the most authentic experiences across the broader sports world. This month saw the launch of NHL\n25 and with enhanced gameplay powered by a new technology called ICE Q that delivers the most authentic hockey experience to date. Our\nincredible portfolio of EA Sports experiences engage and connect hundreds of millions of fans and sit at the intersection of sports, entertainment,\ntechnology, fandom and culture.\nAcross more platforms, more modalities and more geographies were delivering interactive experiences that reach more fans than anyone else in\nsports and we're not stopping there. We are building on this momentum and leaning into harnessing the power of this massive global community\nwith the EA Sports app. This means more deeply engaging our core fans and welcoming and inspiring an entirely new generation of sports fans\nto. Our upcoming soft launch in Spain will focus on European football and benefit from our partnership with La Liga.\nOur unique positioning in bridging real-world sports with interactive entertainment sets us apart to be able to build a feature-rich app combining\nsports content such as highlights, interactive live data and social features and we're able to start from a position of strength with our EA Sports\naudience that numbers in the hundreds of millions. Global Football is just the beginning. We plan to introduce more sports in more regions in the\nfuture through a scaled release cadence with data from each release helping to define deeply engaging future features. This marks a big step\nforward in our vision to make EA Sports the most valuable sports business on the planet.\nIn the quarter, Season 22 and Apex Legends launched with significantly more new features for casual and seasoned players alike, including more\nmodes and new map and new anti-cheat software. Following changes to the Battle Pass construct, we did not see the lift in monetization we had\nexpected. Two things have become clear in the free-to-play FPS category. First, in the competitive landscape where brand, a strong core player\nbase and high-quality mechanics matter more than ever, Apex has proven to be a compelling franchise for us and an industry still ward.\nSecond, to drive significant growth and reengagement, large systematic changes acquired. We will continue to focus on retention and breadth of\ncontent in service of our global community as we work towards more significant innovative changes in the future. Turning to The Sims universe.\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the world was first introduced to this beloved franchise. Since then, more than 500 million have joined the community.\nAs we outlined at Investor Day, The Sims will move beyond linear sequential releases with the goal to offer more options for players to engage\nwith the brand than ever before.\nWe started with rebuilding reengineering and reimagining The Sims 4. Building Sims 4 as the foundation of the franchise enables our players to\ncontinue to engage with the content that collected, created and built over the past decade and engage in new evolving experiences. This allows\nus to focus on creating a variety of games and experiences, deep simulation games, cozy games, social and collaborative base gameplay and mobile\nnarrative games. The life and death expansion pack in Sims 4 is drop in October 31, and early indicators show it's trending ahead of episode 16.\nStarting November, a new UGX product, The Sims 4 Creator Kit designed and built by our community creators will start rolling out. Also in November,\nMy Sims Cozy bundle launches on Nintendo Switch.\nIn the Sims Labs, an incubator for testing new innovations and features, players are trying a plethora of new ideas. These launches and tests this\nquarter are a core part of how we are investing in a massive Sims platform across more game experiences, more creative options and more ways\nfor players and creators to connect. There's much more to come for the franchise, including a film in the works in partnership with Amazon MGM\nStudios. The Sims represents an incredible opportunity as it becomes an even bigger cultural icon and massive online community.\nIt's an amazing time at EA. And in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veil guard. It's been 10 years since we launched its predecessor Game\nof the Year Winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high-quality depth and detail in niches action pack adventure.\nWe expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connect fans in truly unique ways.

You should expect more key developments and news around\nour massive online communities, including Battlefield and skate in the coming quarters.\nOur Q2 results represent momentum in our business as we continue to execute our strategy to drive sustainable long-term growth built across\nthe engagement modalities of play, create, watch and connect. Now, let me turn the call over to Stuart for a deeper look into this quarter and our\nbusiness overall.\nStuart Canfield - Electronic Arts Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nThank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. Building on our momentum from Q1, we delivered a record net bookings for Q2 exceeding the high end\nof our guidance range. Our result is a testament to our team's commitment to delivering high-quality experiences that deeply engage and entertain\nand global communities prior to this quarter by the strong performance of our EA SPORTS franchises. As we wrap up an incredible first half of the\nfiscal year, we are raising our FY '25 guidance.\nNow, as we look to the future, we remain focused on executing the strategic road map outlined at our Investor Day, delivering long-term value\ncreation through increased scale to drive top line growth, improve margins and greater cash flow. Now turning to the quarter, Q2 net bookings\nwas $2.08 billion, up 14% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations with the strong reception at EA Sports College Football 25. This quarter, our\nnet bookings saw minimal impact from FX. Our full game net bookings was $832 million, up 20% year-over-year highlighted by the successful\nexpansion of our American football ecosystem.\nOur Live Services net bookings was $1.25 billion, up 10% year-over-year. This strong performance exceeds our expectations as our American football\nultimately modes, delivered engaging entertainment to players across both College Football and Madden NFL. On a trailing 12-month basis, live\nservices comprised 74% of our business. As we shared at our Investor Day, a key pillar of our long-term strategy is driving scale in our massive online\ncommunities.\nIn Q2, we took a major step forward in expanding American Football with the incredibly successful launch of College Football 25 to complement\nour Madden NFL HD and mobile offerings. The strong performance of our MVP bundle underscores the power of an aggregated community and\nan expanded ecosystem of experiences. As we scale this collective life services business, we have driven significant net growth through increased\nengagement and the acquisition of new players with both engagement and overall spend more than doubling this quarter on a year-over-year\nbasis. It's clear players are enjoying both experiences. And over time, we will build an ever more connected ecosystem.\nMomentum continues in Global Football as we remain on track to grow net bookings in FY '25 over a record prior year. For the quarter, we delivered\nin line with our expectations as EA SPORTS FC 24 strength continued into the lead-up to the test launch of FC 25. In our new HD title, we continue\nto make progress on delivering engaging experiences including Rush and content in our Ultimate Team business. As a result, both spender\nconversion and monetization metrics improved year-over-year.\nWe also saw positive results beyond HD as both FC Mobile and FC Online saw net bookings growth from increased monetization. As discussed\nduring our Investor Day, Apex Legends net bookings fell short of our expectations for the quarter as we extended freemium access across the\nentirety of the first half of the season 22 Battle Pass. Following the second half release of the Battle Pass on September 17, we observed a return\nto spending conversion levels consistent with previous seasons. As we look forward, we have adjusted the rest of FY '25 to reflect lower engagement\nthan expected versus our prior guidance.\nAs Andrew mentioned, we are committed to delivering new experiences for our players with a continued focus on enhancing player engagement\nand retention. In The Sims, we continue to advance the franchise by delivering new player experiences that deeply engage and captivate our\ncommunity. During the quarter, we launched the Repos Reward gameplay event, offering players weekly challenges that resulted in a 6%\nyear-over-year increase in weekly active users. This event, coupled with increased engagement throughout the quarter, drove strong player demand\nfor our catalog of content surpassing our expectations for the quarter.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Now moving to our GAAP quarterly results. We delivered Q2 net revenue of $2.03 billion,\nup 6% year-over-year. Gross margins increased 130 basis points, largely a result of higher digital mix and lower licensing costs.\nOperating expenses came in below our expectations at $1.19 billion up 10% year-over-year, driven largely by expenses related to our February\nrestructuring event and increased people costs to support strategic initiatives. Earnings per share was $1.11. As a reminder, in the year ago period,\nwe saw a $0.34 onetime noncash tax benefit. We delivered a record Q2 result for operating cash flow of $234 million more than double the prior\nyear period primarily due to timing of launches.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow reached $1.98 billion, underscoring the strength of our business. Please see our earnings slides for\nfurther cash flow information. In the second quarter, we returned $426 million to stockholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Now turning\nto guidance. Given our strong performance in the first half, we are raising our net bookings guidance range for FY '25 to $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion,\nup 1% to up 5% year-over-year. Our revised range implies a midpoint that is at the top end of our previous guidance.\nOur net bookings assumptions for the second half of the year are as follows: first, as shared at Investor Day, we continue to expect our American\nfootball business to exceed $1 billion for FY '25. Second, after the successful launch of FC 25, we continue to expect our EA SPORTS FC franchise\nto grow over a record FY '24. Third, despite lower expectations for Apex Legends, we are on track to maintain mid-single-digit growth in our core\nlive services. And fourth, we're maintaining our assumptions for our upcoming Dragon Age: The Veilguard launch this week and our partner title\nslated to launch in Q4.\nTurning to our FY '25 GAAP outlook, we are raising net revenue guidance to $7.4 billion to $7.7 billion. We expect cost of revenue to be $1.53 billion\nto $1.56 billion. We now expect operating expenses to be approximately $4.445 billion to $4.15 billion, up 3% to 4% year-over-year. As a result, we\nexpect GAAP operating margin to be 19.3% to 21.1%.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 30.7% to 32.1%. The impact from change in deferred net revenue is expected to be approximately\n90 to 80 basis points. This results in a revised earnings per share of $3.82 to $4.33. We are also increasing our operating cash flow guidance to $2.075\nbillion to $2.275 billion. Capital expenditures now are expected to be $225 million.\nAs a result, our free cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, we had a $150 million cash tax benefit\nin the prior year. If rates remain unchanged from today, we expect minimal impact to net bookings from FX. For more information on the impact\nof FX movements, please refer to our earnings slides.\nTurning to Q3, we expect net bookings of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion, up 1% to up 8% year-over-year, largely driven by the launch of Dragon Age\nand continued growth in our EA Sports FC franchise. We expect the performance of our catalog and the impact from Sunset mobile titles to be a\ncombined headwind of approximately 3%. We expect net revenue of $1.875 billion to $2.025 billion, cost of revenue to be $450 million to $480\nmillion and operating expenses of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion resulting in earnings per share of $0.85 to $1.02. Before I turn the call\nover to Andrew, I want to take a moment to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial framework, which we first introduced earlier this\nyear and expanded upon during our Investor Day.\nExiting the first half of fiscal year '25, we have strong momentum, enabling us to raise our full year guidance while also building conviction in our\nability to significantly outperform the market through FY '27 for net bookings growth. And as we drive increased scale in our top line, we expect\nmaterial margin expansion from FY '25 through FY '27 even as we continue to invest in the future. Our robust framework for long-term value\ncreation remains strong and we are dedicated to executing the strategic priorities and initiatives presented at our Investor Day. In closing, I also\nwant to take a quick moment to thank those of you who joined us in person and via live stream for our Investor Day last month.\nWe appreciate your support and our journey as we lead the future entertainment.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

This all means incredible things to come as we execute across our long-term strategy. As players increasingly embrace games and\nexperiences to play, create, watch and connect we have an incredible opportunity to build and grow more fully connected platforms to deliver\nmore value and less friction for fans everywhere. We are building for this future today.\nOur incredible teams utilizing cutting-edge technology continue to push the depth and breadth of what is possible in entertainment. As such, we\nare well positioned in service of our people, players, communities and stockholders to seize our biggest opportunities and to grow as a global\nleader in entertainment. And now Stuart and I are ready to take your questions.\nAndrew Uerkwitz - Electronic Arts Inc - Vice President, Investor Relations\nThanks, Andrew. As a reminder, we will take one question and one follow-up from each analyst. With that, John, we are now ready to take the first\nquestion.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Colin Sebastian, Baird.\nColin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst\nGreat. The growth in American football, obviously very impressive, well done with college football. I guess as one sort of follow-up, Andrew, to\nyour plans for that. How do you capture that momentum on a long-term basis? Obviously, there's a lot of content involved in community but any\nmore details on the product road map there that give us a little more visibility into potentially growing that on a year-over-year sustained level?\nAnd as a follow-up on the launch plans for the EA Sports app, I guess the broader opportunities in connecting video games with sports data, sports\ninformation and live sports, how should we think about the cadence of the rollout of those services? And how much maybe partnerships will play\na role with that?\nAndrew Wilson - Electronic Arts Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nOkay. Thank you. There's a lot in there, but great questions. First, on American football, this has been a very thoughtful, deliberate calculated rollout\nplan by our EA Sports team. Again, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. A big part of the evolution of our business has moved away from\na product launch on an annualized basis or even a seasoned bound service as it relates to the NFL season and really moving the Madden franchise\ninto more of a football fan platform that serves all American football fans in the connect for 365 days a year.\nAnd we've seen our teams lean into real-world events, and we've seen them build with the community, community-driven events that's allowed\nour fans to engage with the sport they love 365 days a year. But a few years ago, as we started to look at the potential to bring College Football\nback, we knew the objective wasn't to replace one game with another game, but to actually really lean into the community of football fans more\nbroadly and build a symbiotic relationship between both Madden and College. And you've seen that play out even this season with the MVP bundle,\nwhich was one of the biggest selling single products in the packaged goods realm in the industry this year.\nBut certainly, as we start to think about team builder across the franchises as we think about Ultimate Team across the franchises, what the team\nis doing now is really thinking about the long-term future of this incredibly engaged football fan community across both NFL and College. We have\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

We have a full team working\non College on a go-forward basis with the objective to build and grow that business. But the bigger opportunity for us is really to become kind of\nthe preeminent football fan platform in this country and do that across both NFL and College and the EA SPORTS teams are working in sync with\nour partners, both with the NFL, the schools, the conferences and the players in college to do that on a go-forward basis in the future.\nWe've grown the business this year. We've more than doubled the players in the ecosystem, 25% of those players are new are bringing back lapsed\nplayers into our football fan community. Engagement is up meaningfully across the two products, 140% growth in engagement. And so as we look\nat this, this is a business firing on all cylinders.\nThis is a business where our teams are really supporting the fan community better than most other sports, I think, in the industry and we're really\nexcited by the growth that we'll be able to drive in this both in the context of play on the field, but also in the context of social engagement beyond\nthe field of play. For the EA SPORTS app, to get to your second part of your question, again, we think this is a really exciting opportunity for us. We\nhave hundreds of millions of sports fans that come together every day and play games in the context of FC and Madden and College and Hockey\nand UFC and F1 and others. And what they do right after they leave our game is they go to another platform, and they chat about the game they\njust had or they go to another platform, and they create content around the game they just played or they go to another platform, and they watch\nvideo of that content that they just created or that their friends created.\nWe think we have an incredible opportunity to actually bring all of those things together for our fan community and remove a great deal of friction\nas it relates to that broader fan experience beyond the bounds of our games. The fact that we have more license partners than any other entity in\nthe world in the connect of the real world of sport also allows us to do very interesting things that may be not possible for the traditional purveyors\nof sport when we think about bringing real-world sports content, real world sports highlights, real-world sports commentary into that ecosystem\nand allowing our fans, our existing hundred millions of fans to slam together the content they create with content from the real world of sport.\nAnd we expect that, that will actually attract more sports fans that may not even play our game today in the years ahead. We're starting with Spain.\nWe have an incredible partnership with La Liga. And we've talked about that at Investor Day that allows us to bring a great deal of real-world\ncontent together with the virtual content that is born out of our game. We have as I said, we have more sports partnerships than any other entity\nin the world and our expectations that we'll continue to work with those partners on a global basis to really enrich the sports fan experience, not\njust for Global Football, but for American football and every other major sport in the world.\nThe rollout will be on a kind of a phase-by-phase basis will take each step as an opportunity to serve more fans, but more importantly, learn from\nthose fans, what features that are most compelling. What we're doing is cutting edge. It's not been done before where you bring together the\ntotality of the sports fan experience across real and virtual. That's an exciting opportunity for us, but it also means we'll have to be very thoughtful\nand deliberate as we roll out over the course of time.\nOperator\nEric Handler, ROTH Capital.\nEric Handler - ROTH Capital Partners, LLC - Analyst\nI wonder if you'd be willing to sort of break down your live services in terms of as you're thinking about guidance for this year between will live\nservices for sports? Should we think about that up being double digits? And what does that mean for your non-sports business?\nStuart Canfield - Electronic Arts Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nEric, Stuart. Let me just let me frame a couple of things in. The most important on live services as part of raising our guidance, obviously, we passed\nthrough H1 before outperformance, which obviously incorporate elements of live service as we started and launched our over EA Sports franchise.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved. Republication or redistribution of Refinitiv content, including by framing or similar means, is prohibited without the prior written\nconsent of Refinitiv. 'Refinitiv' and the Refinitiv logo are registered trademarks of Refinitiv and its affiliated companies.\nOCTOBER 29, 2024 / 9:00PM, EA.OQ - Q2 2025 Electronic Arts Inc Earnings Call\nWe have said that we will continue to see live service growth be mid-single digits through the back half of the year. And you should think that's\ndriven by a couple of key elements.\nOne, we've stated we have two live services across both College and NFL, and we do expect our business to continue to reach over $1 billion in\nnet bookings. We obviously expect growth in our FC franchise over a record prior year in FY '24, which incorporates our life service business as well.\nAnd we have obviously launched a full game that are different to the prior year pagination that title in Q4. And despite the pragmatism we put\ninside of Apex, we do expect that the holistic overall business will remain at mid-single digits with obviously a heavier mix on sports and less so\non non-sports or entertainment, but net back into a growth position for the year.\nEric Handler - ROTH Capital Partners, LLC - Analyst\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up. So as you take the learnings for season 22, I believe, for Apex. How are you thinking about the next season and\nwhat you progress with in terms of the battle passes and any other types of experiences in the season?\nStuart Canfield - Electronic Arts Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nYes. First of all, let's talk a little about Q2. I think we tried to outline that post giving guidance previously as we talked about Investor Day. We have\nchanged fundamentally as part of the ongoing innovation are part of the service and how we reinvigorate and bring deeper feature set into the\nproduct as we move forward. So we did make meaningful changes. We split the Battle Pass into two.\nWe actually extended the freemium entry point inside of that first period, that first split as we call out. We launched the premium aspect actually\non our Investor Day, and we saw meaningful conversion get back to prior levels on the way through. We have seen a lower player engagement\nbase of this part of the cycle and we have reflected that all the way through the rest of the year. So Andrew's earlier comments, we have an incredible\nIP and game inside of Apex.\nWe continue to invest behind making sure we have meaningful change and systemic change inside the product as we look to the future and you\nexpect us to see that we can start to grow the business back as we get through the latter parts of early 2016 and beyond.\nAndrew Wilson - Electronic Arts Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nI might add a little something there as we think about Apex. I think, again, along with my prepared remarks, but just a little more context, I think\nwhat we've come to understand is we look at these large-scale live service-driven free-to-play businesses, particularly with our experience in Asia\nand in the West. And what we have observed over the last 15 or 20 years is really two things. One is that once you reach a level of scale by virtue\nof a quality game with incredible mechanic, innovation, creativity and a large global player base.\nIt's very, very difficult to displace them from the top tier of games played in the world. But what is equally true is that the level of innovation and\ncreativity has to continue to scale with the community over time to ensure you can maintain growth and not just maintain size. And so as you think\nabout us in Apex, we're in an incredibly good position given that we have reached that very top tier. We do have an incredibly strong brand a really\nstrong mechanic and a very committed global community.\nAs we go forward, we'll really be investing on two vectors. The first is in the growth of our season oriented content, and what you've seen from us\nover the last few seasons is progressively bigger season drops each time. Very high quality has driven very high sentiment amongst our player\nbase, and we're adding to the level of innovation and creativity on a season-by-season basis. But to Stuart's point, as we think about step function\ngrowth over the course of time, what we've also observed is a need for kind of meaningful systematic innovation in the game that fundamentally\nchanges the way the game plays more broadly and our teams are working on that as well.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

As you're going through the systematic rethink of Apex, how much of this can maybe\nbe done fixing a part while the car is in motion? Or is this something that may require like a whole studs up rebuild and something like an Apex\n2.0 might be the way to go about it rather than incremental change?\nAndrew Wilson - Electronic Arts Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nIt's a really good question and probably beyond the scope of this conversation. But what I would say is that typically, what we have seen again, in\nthe context of live service driven games at scale is the version two thing has almost never been as successful as the version one thing. And so\nactually, the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have and deliver the new innovative\ncreative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the\nprogress that they've made or the investment that they have put into the existing ecosystem.\nAnytime we call a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation creativity,\nthat's never a good place to put our community in. And so our objective will be to continue to innovate in the core experience, and you're seeing\nthat from season to season now as our seasons get progressively bigger, and we're changing kind of key modalities at play within those seasons\nand then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers. And we\nthink we can do those two things together, and we don't believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so. But again, the team is\nworking through this now.\nAndrew Marok - Raymond James Financial Group, Inc. - Analyst\nGreat. And then maybe one quick one on Veilguard, if I could. I have seen some very strong reviews so far. But as far as you can tell, what drives\nthat kind of breakout of success we've seen in some single-player fantasy games in the last couple of years? And how do you feel that Veilguard\nmight compare along those lines?\nAndrew Wilson - Electronic Arts Inc - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nI certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition one Game of the Year and was a very strong performer\nfor us in the conduct of our business. This is entertainment. And so while much of our business has moved to live service moment-to-moment,\ndeliver innovation and creativity for a deeply engaged community over the course of time. this opportunity to bring in incredibly high quality,\ncreative storytelling set in amazing world with rich characters living out those stories you're able to capture that moment in entertainment success\nalmost certainly follows.\nAnd we see that in the context of movies, and we're seeing in the context of TV seasons, and we see in the context of video games. When we think\nabout what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storage studio in BioWare. We have a storied IP and Dragon Age. We have a team that\ntook extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling I think we're going into a market\nthat has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

The team feels really energized by what\nthey have delivered. And my sense is that, yes, it has breakout capabilities.\nStuart Canfield - Electronic Arts Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nAndrew, just to add for that. Just on the back of Andrew's comments, obviously, we feel with positioning probably well for the purpose of how we\nthink about the back half of the year, we maintained our original assumptions for the game at this point.\nOperator\nChris Schoell, UBS.\nChris Schoell - UBS Group AG - Analyst\nStuart, using the midpoint of your guidance range, I believe, implies a bookings acceleration in fiscal 4Q relative to fiscal 3Q. Can you just help us\nthink through the drivers there? I recognize there's a partner title, but any incremental color would be helpful. And then maybe just one on the\nfootball franchise. I appreciate the stats you gave on a total football basis. But any further details you can give regarding College football's impact\non Madden to date? And how do you expect that dynamic to evolve going forward?\nStuart Canfield - Electronic Arts Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nSo first of all, so as we outlined before in the macro framework, we obviously passed through H1 performance through the full year, which means,\nby implication, we're expecting the balance here to deliver on our expectations with some puts and takes on key properties. As you think about\nthe quarterly phasing is always important to remember, we have differences between release slates, obviously, seasonality and title launches would\nchange some of that mix and some of those comparable year-on-year look back in past quarters where it's World Cup. 18 months ago, we have a\nnew title launch in Q4 this year, we didn't have before.\nSo have to take you through some of the puts and takes around the phasing between Q3 and Q4 as we see that occur. On the overall American\nfootball business, we feel incredibly convicted that performance that we saw inside of Q2. Obviously, to a somewhat Andrew's commentary earlier,\nwe had strong performance from both NPV College and obviously, the overall broader exist American football. And we expect both of that to --\nboth of the properties to still continue as part existed through the back half of the year by virtue of the raised midpoint that we put inside the\nguidance.\nOperator\nDoug Creutz, TD Cowen.\nDoug Creutz - TD Cowen - Analyst\nYou mentioned Dragon Age: Inquisition earlier, and I think it's fair to say that since then, BioWare has had a somewhat challenging decade with a\nlot of turnover management. And and some titles that didn't work as well as they would have liked. What have you done? What is LoRa done over\nthe past several years to put BioWare into a position to ship a strong title like Veilguard? And what does this say about the future of BioWare from\nhere?\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And there's a great deal of things that have happened. First, I would say, as we look back over Bioware, BioWare has\nbeen across a number of different studios and build a number of different types of games Anthem is probably the one that people remember most\nfor not really living up to the expectations of what a BioWare game should be. And while that is almost certainly true what I'd remind people is it\nwas also by we're trying to do something very, very different than what would typically be known as a BioWare game.\nIt was really about building different mechanics and different models at play into a BioWare world. And while the reviews at the time actually\nheralded the world as being incredibly rich and wonderful and high fidelity and traversing that world being great and something like character is\nbeing super interesting the pieces of the puzzle just didn't quite come together in the way that I think BioWare had hoped. A big shift happened\nafter that, which was by we're really returning to BioWare type games, really returning to BioWare's strength.\nAnd what's happened subsequently since Anthem is the BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan favorite studio and a\nfan favorite brand and the types of games they make incredibly rich world, incredibly nuanced characters really powerful and compelling stories\nwith comradery and friendship and relationships and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay. And I think it's really been that return to\nwhat made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to really deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age\nworld is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\nOkay. Well, thank you all for being here, and thank you for your excellent questions.
