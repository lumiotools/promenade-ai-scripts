(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today announced the payment of a semi-annual interest payment and Regular Additional Distribution to the holders as of November 1, 2024 of the 4.0% Senior Exchangeable Debentures due 2029 (the \"Debentures\") issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Interactive LLC (“LI LLC”).The semi-annual interest payment amount is $20.00 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures (a “Debenture”), and the amount of the Regular Additional Distribution is $0.4302 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures. \n\nUnder the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is reduced by an amount equal to each Extraordinary Additional Distribution made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive semi-annual interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the semi-annual interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 4.0% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular Extraordinary Additional Distribution that results in an adjustment to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that Extraordinary Additional Distribution. \n\nTo date, there has been one Extraordinary Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures. On August 7, 2013, LI LLC made an Extraordinary Additional Distribution of $63.0960 per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures arising from the merger transaction between Sprint Nextel Corporation and SoftBank Corp. \n\nAdjustments to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the semi-annual interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 4.0% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the semi-annual interest payment being made on the Debentures announced today, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures: \n\nNovember 15, 2024 Beginning Adjusted Principal  |  Total  Payment  |  Interest  |  Additional Payment of Principal  |  November 15, 2024 Ending Adjusted Principal   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n$904.3676  |  $20.0000  |  $18.0874  |  $1.9126  |  $902.4550   \n  \nLI LLC is also making a Regular Additional Distribution to holders of the Debentures as of November 1, 2024 of $0.4302 per Debenture, which is attributable to the regular quarterly cash dividend paid by T-Mobile US, Inc. of $0.65 per share on June 13, 2024 and September 12, 2024. The payment of the Regular Additional Distribution will not result in a reduction to the adjusted principal amount of the Debentures. \n\nThe semi-annual interest payment and Regular Additional Distribution are expected to be paid on November 15, 2024 to holders of record of the Debentures on November 1, 2024. \n\nOn April 1, 2020, T-Mobile US, Inc. completed its acquisition of Sprint Corporation (“TMUS/S Acquisition”) for 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile US, Inc. for every share of Sprint Corporation. Following the TMUS/S Acquisition, the reference shares attributable to each $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures consist of 0.3309 shares of common stock of T-Mobile US, Inc. (Nasdaq: TMUS) and 0.7860 shares of common stock of Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LUMN). \n\n**About Qurate Retail, Inc.**\n\nQurate Retail, Inc. is a Fortune 500 company comprised of six leading retail brands – QVC®, HSN®, Ballard Designs®, Frontgate®, Garnet Hill® and Grandin Road® (collectively, “Qurate Retail GroupSM”).

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1). \n\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current headline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of our programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and resulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold consolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating expenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer in which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit profile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile. \n\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and free cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable, leaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic growth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social and streaming platforms.” \n\nThird quarter 2024 headlines: \n\n  * Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\n  * Generated $152 million in operating income \n  * Adjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250 million \n  * QxH revenue decreased 6% \n  * QVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency \n  * Cornerstone revenue decreased 12% \n  * Tendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes \n    * Partially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 \n    * Improves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity profile \n\n\n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**Revenue**  \nQxH  |  $  |  1,617  |  $  |  1,521  |  (6  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  577  |  571  |  (1  |  )%  |  (1  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  285  |  252  |  (12  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Revenue** |  **2,479** |  **2,344** |  **(5** |  **)%** |  **(5** |  **)%**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  91  |  $  |  107  |  18  |  %   \nQVC International  |  63  |  57  |  (10  |  )%  |  (8  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  4  |  (2  |  )  |  NM   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (7  |  )  |  (10  |  )  |  (43  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Operating Income** |  **151** |  **152** |  **1** |  **%** |  **1** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted OIBDA**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  201  |  $  |  182  |  (9  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  77  |  70  |  (9  |  )%  |  (9  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  11  |  6  |  (45  |  )%   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **250** |  **(12** |  **)%** |  **(12** |  **)%**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling Schedule 2.   \n  \n**QxH**\n\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and handling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all categories. \n\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time net restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and sales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven by higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by increased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower personnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs due to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign. \n\n**QVC International**\n\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in average selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable returns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with a decline in apparel and beauty. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment costs and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment costs increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins decreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates, partially offset by favorable returns. \n\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. The Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened 3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also provide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant currency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where applicable. \n\n**Cornerstone**\n\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in the home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue and profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to its transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**QxH**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  65.4  |  %  |  65.5  |  %  |  10  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) |  5.6  |  %  |  7.0  |  %  |  140  |  bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b) |  12.4  |  %  |  12.0  |  %  |  (40  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  $  |  51.78  |  $  |  51.76  |  0  |  %   \nUnits Sold  |  (6  |  )%   \nReturn Rate(c) |  15.4  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  (80  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  996  |  $  |  967  |  (3  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  61.6  |  %  |  63.6  |  %  |  200  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.0  |  %  |  70.7  |  %  |  170  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  8.2  |  7.9  |  (4  |  )%   \n**QVC International**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  63.4  |  %  |  64.6  |  %  |  120  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  10.9  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  (90  |  )bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  13.3  |  %  |  12.3  |  %  |  (100  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  (3  |  )%  |  (3  |  )%   \nUnits Sold  |  1  |  %   \nReturn Rate(c) |  19.6  |  %  |  18.9  |  %  |  (70  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  283  |  $  |  297  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  49.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  300  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.3  |  %  |  76.1  |  %  |  680  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  4.2  |  4.0  |  (5  |  )%   \n**Cornerstone**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  62.8  |  %  |  59.9  |  %  |  (290  |  )bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  1.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  3.9  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  (150  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  218  |  $  |  188  |  (14  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  76.5  |  %  |  74.6  |  %  |  (190  |  )bps   \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

It is subject to mandatory redemption on March 15, 2031. The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is recorded net of capitalized costs.   \nd)  |  As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit facility.   \n  \nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC completed an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375% senior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at Qurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior secured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility. \n\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental availability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s revolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income for purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service the principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by QVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit agreement. \n\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Important Notice:** Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss Qurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904, passcode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.

Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about business strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s transformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial performance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public health crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social media and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties related to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations. \n\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as presented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. \n\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of financial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign currency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use constant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the financial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average selling price. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  4Q23  |  1Q24  |  2Q24  |  3Q24   \n**Qurate Retail Operating Income (Loss)** |  $  |  151  |  $  |  (103  |  )  |  $  |  145  |  $  |  165  |  $  |  152   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  105  |  98  |  99  |  96  |  95   \nStock compensation expense  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  3  |  3   \nRestructuring, penalty and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses)(a) |  19  |  —  |  —  |  18  |  —   \nImpairment of intangible assets(b) |  —  |  326  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions(c) |  —  |  6  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **340** |  **$** |  **259** |  **$** |  **282** |  **$** |  **250**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA.   \nb)  |  In the fourth quarter of 2023, QxH recognized a $326 million non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill.   \nc)  |  Includes a loss related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a gain related to the sale leaseback of a German property in the first quarter of 2024.

Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus\ndepreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments,\nlitigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount\ninventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions.\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its\nbusinesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of\nongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical\ncomparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted\nOIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP\nmeasure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that\nQurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets.\nNon-GAAP Information – Schedule\nQurate Retail, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted OIBDA, USD Millions\nFY-22 FY-23 LTM Sept 2024 YTD 2024\nOperating Income (Loss) $ (2,041) $ 590 $ 359 $ 462\nDepreciation and amortization 481 407 388 290\nStock compensation expense 60 53 35 22\nRestructuring, penalties and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) 3 (189) 18 18\nImpairment of intangible assets 3,081 326 326 -\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions (520) (113) 5 (1)\nAdjusted OIBDA $ 1,064 $ 1,074 $ 1,131 $ 791\nRevenue $ 12,106 $ 10,915 $ 10,236 $ 7,093\nAdjusted OIBDA margin 8.8% 9.8% 11.0% 11.2%"

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1). \n\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current headline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of our programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson, President and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and resulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold consolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating expenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer in which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit profile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile. \n\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and free cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable, leaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic growth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social and streaming platforms.” \n\nThird quarter 2024 headlines: \n\n  * Qurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\n  * Generated $152 million in operating income \n  * Adjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250 million \n  * QxH revenue decreased 6% \n  * QVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency \n  * Cornerstone revenue decreased 12% \n  * Tendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes \n    * Partially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 \n    * Improves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity profile \n\n\n\nDiscussion of Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**Revenue**  \nQxH  |  $  |  1,617  |  $  |  1,521  |  (6  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  577  |  571  |  (1  |  )%  |  (1  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  285  |  252  |  (12  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Revenue** |  **2,479** |  **2,344** |  **(5** |  **)%** |  **(5** |  **)%**  \n**Operating Income (Loss)**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  91  |  $  |  107  |  18  |  %   \nQVC International  |  63  |  57  |  (10  |  )%  |  (8  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  4  |  (2  |  )  |  NM   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (7  |  )  |  (10  |  )  |  (43  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Operating Income** |  **151** |  **152** |  **1** |  **%** |  **1** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted OIBDA**  \nQxH(b) |  $  |  201  |  $  |  182  |  (9  |  )%   \nQVC International  |  77  |  70  |  (9  |  )%  |  (9  |  )%   \nCornerstone  |  11  |  6  |  (45  |  )%   \nUnallocated corporate cost  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (100  |  )%   \n**Total Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **250** |  **(12** |  **)%** |  **(12** |  **)%**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are included in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling Schedule 2.   \n  \n**QxH**\n\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and handling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all categories. \n\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time net restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period. \n\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and sales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven by higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by increased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower personnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs due to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign. \n\n**QVC International**\n\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in average selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable returns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with a decline in apparel and beauty. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment costs and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment costs increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins decreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates, partially offset by favorable returns. \n\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. The Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened 3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also provide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant currency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where applicable. \n\n**Cornerstone**\n\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in the home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue and profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to its transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. \n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS**  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)_ |  3Q23  |  3Q24  |  % Change  |  % Change Constant Currency(a)  \n**QxH**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  65.4  |  %  |  65.5  |  %  |  10  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) |  5.6  |  %  |  7.0  |  %  |  140  |  bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b) |  12.4  |  %  |  12.0  |  %  |  (40  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  $  |  51.78  |  $  |  51.76  |  0  |  %   \nUnits Sold  |  (6  |  )%   \nReturn Rate(c) |  15.4  |  %  |  14.6  |  %  |  (80  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  996  |  $  |  967  |  (3  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  61.6  |  %  |  63.6  |  %  |  200  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.0  |  %  |  70.7  |  %  |  170  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  8.2  |  7.9  |  (4  |  )%   \n**QVC International**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  63.4  |  %  |  64.6  |  %  |  120  |  bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  10.9  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  (90  |  )bps   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  13.3  |  %  |  12.3  |  %  |  (100  |  )bps   \nAverage Selling Price  |  (3  |  )%  |  (3  |  )%   \nUnits Sold  |  1  |  %   \nReturn Rate(c) |  19.6  |  %  |  18.9  |  %  |  (70  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  283  |  $  |  297  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  49.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  300  |  bps   \nMobile % of eCommerce Revenue(e) |  69.3  |  %  |  76.1  |  %  |  680  |  bps   \nLTM Total Customers(f) |  4.2  |  4.0  |  (5  |  )%   \n**Cornerstone**  \nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue  |  62.8  |  %  |  59.9  |  %  |  (290  |  )bps   \nOperating Income Margin (%)  |  1.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM   \nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)  |  3.9  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  (150  |  )bps   \neCommerce Revenue(d) |  $  |  218  |  $  |  188  |  (14  |  )%   \neCommerce % of Total Revenue  |  76.5  |  %  |  74.6  |  %  |  (190  |  )bps   \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.   \nb)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

It is subject to mandatory redemption on March 15, 2031. The Preferred Stock is considered a liability for GAAP purposes, and is recorded net of capitalized costs.   \nd)  |  As defined in QVC’s credit agreement. A portion of expected cost savings are included in Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit facility.   \n  \nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt repayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC completed an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375% senior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at Qurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior secured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility. \n\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental availability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit. QVC’s leverage ratio, as defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 3.1x at quarter-end. Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s revolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income for purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s senior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to make unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service the principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by QVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax obligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit agreement. \n\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Important Notice:** Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss Qurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on November 7, 2024. The call can be accessed by dialing (877) 704-4234 or (215) 268-9904, passcode 13744091, at least 10 minutes prior to the start time. The call will also be broadcast live across the Internet and archived on our website. To access the webcast go to https://www.qurateretail.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar. Links to this press release and replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website. \n\n_This press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about business strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s transformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial performance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive issues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms acceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of investment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public health crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social media and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties related to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press release._\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a reconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under GAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified impairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire related costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale leaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as Adjusted OIBDA divided by revenue. \n\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations. \n\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as presented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. \n\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of financial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign currency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use constant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the financial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average selling price. \n\nSCHEDULE 1 \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION  \n---  \n_(amounts in millions)_ |  3Q23  |  4Q23  |  1Q24  |  2Q24  |  3Q24   \n**Qurate Retail Operating Income (Loss)** |  $  |  151  |  $  |  (103  |  )  |  $  |  145  |  $  |  165  |  $  |  152   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  105  |  98  |  99  |  96  |  95   \nStock compensation expense  |  10  |  13  |  16  |  3  |  3   \nRestructuring, penalty and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) (including Rocky Mount inventory losses)(a) |  19  |  —  |  —  |  18  |  —   \nImpairment of intangible assets(b) |  —  |  326  |  —  |  —  |  —   \n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and sale leaseback transactions(c) |  —  |  6  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Qurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA** |  **$** |  **285** |  **$** |  **340** |  **$** |  **259** |  **$** |  **282** |  **$** |  **250**  \n________________________________________  \n---  \na)  |  In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky Mount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.

(\"Qurate Retail\") (Nasdaq:\nQRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) today reported third quarter 2024 results(1).\n“While the third quarter was anticipated to be the most difficult quarter of 2024, current\nheadline events and the challenging macro-economic climate heavily impacted viewership of\nour programming and consumer behavior more than expected,” said David Rawlinson,\nPresident and CEO of Qurate Retail. “As a result, revenue underperformed this quarter and\nresulted in meaningful bottom-line deleverage. Despite this, we were able to hold\nconsolidated gross margin flat with disciplined cost management and reduced operating\nexpenses. We also continued our proactive balance sheet management, completing an offer\nin which 89% of QVC’s 2027 and 2028 notes were tendered which improves the QVC credit\nprofile with reduced debt and an extended maturity profile.\n“We are nearing the end of our multi-year Project Athens initiative focused on margin and\nfree cash flow. The team has materially improved the business, becoming a more profitable,\nleaner and more nimble organization. We are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic\ngrowth as we enhance our capabilities to reach aggregated audiences on primarily social\nand streaming platforms.”\nThird quarter 2024 headlines:\nQurate Retail revenue decreased 5% in both US Dollars and constant currency(2)\nGenerated $152 million in operating income\nAdjusted OIBDA(3) decreased 12% in both US Dollars and constant currency to $250\nmillion\nQxH revenue decreased 6%\nQVC International revenue decreased 1% in both US Dollars and constant currency\nCornerstone revenue decreased 12%\nTendered 89% of QVC, Inc.’s 2027 and 2028 notes\nPartially funded with $605 million of new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029\nImproves QVC credit position with reduced debt balance and extended maturity\nprofile\nDiscussion of Results\nUnless otherwise noted, the following discussion compares financial information for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n% Change\nConstant\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 3Q24 % Change Currency(a)\nRevenue\nQxH $ 1,617 $ 1,521 (6)%\nQVC International 577 571 (1)% (1)%\nCornerstone 285 252 (12)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Revenue\n2,479 2,344 (5)%\n(5)%\nOperating Income (Loss)\nQxH(b) $ 91 $ 107 18%\nQVC International 63 57 (10)% (8)%\nCornerstone 4 (2) NM\nUnallocated corporate cost (7) (10) (43)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Operating\nIncome\n151 152 1%\n1%\nAdjusted OIBDA\nQxH(b) $ 201 $ 182 (9)%\nQVC International 77 70 (9)% (9)%\nCornerstone 11 6 (45)%\nUnallocated corporate cost (4) (8) (100)%\nTotal Qurate Retail Adjusted\nOIBDA $ 285 $ 250 (12)% (12)%\n________________________________________\na)For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.\nb)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky\nMount, NC fulfillment center (“Rocky Mount”) in February 2023 on proceeds released from\nescrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs. These items are\nincluded in operating income and excluded from Adjusted OIBDA. See Reconciling\nSchedule 2.\nQxH\nQxH revenue declined due to a 6% decrease in units shipped as well as lower shipping and\nhandling revenue, partially offset by favorable returns. QxH reported declines in all\ncategories.\nOperating income increased in the third quarter comparing against $19 million of one-time\nnet restructuring costs and penalties incurred in the prior year period.\nAdjusted OIBDA margin(3) decreased due to fulfillment (warehouse and freight) pressure and\nsales deleverage, partially offset by higher product margins. Fulfillment pressure was driven\nby higher fulfillment center wages and freight rates and deleverage, partially offset by\nincreased productivity efficiencies. Operating expenses decreased 6% due to lower\ncommissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% driven by lower\npersonnel expense and outside services costs, partially offset by increased marketing costs\ndue to brand marketing to support QVC’s Age of Possibility campaign.\nQVC International\nQVC International’s constant currency revenue decreased primarily due to a 3% decrease in\naverage selling price, partially offset by a 1% increase in units shipped and favorable\nreturns. QVC International reported constant currency growth in home and accessories, with\na decline in apparel and beauty.\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA margin decreased primarily due to higher fulfillment\ncosts and lower product margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fulfillment\ncosts increased due to higher freight rates and fulfillment center wages. Product margins\ndecreased reflecting lower initial margin due to product mix and higher ocean freight rates,\npartially offset by favorable returns.\nUS Dollar denominated results were not materially impacted by exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe Dollar weakened 3% against the British Pound, 1% against the Euro and strengthened\n3% against the Japanese Yen. The financial metrics presented in this press release also\nprovide a comparison of the percentage change in QVC International’s results in constant\ncurrency to the comparable figures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, where\napplicable.\nCornerstone\nCornerstone revenue decreased, reflecting softness and competitive promotional pressure in\nthe home sector. Cornerstone is implementing a transformation plan to improve its revenue\nand profitability given the continued challenges in the housing sector. Operating income and\nAdjusted OIBDA margin decreased mainly due to higher costs for outside services related to\nits transformation plan and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower supply chain costs.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS\n% Change\n(amounts in millions unless Constant\notherwise noted) 3Q23 3Q24 % Change Currency(a)\nQxH\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 65.4% 65.5% 10bps\nOperating Income Margin (%)(b) 5.6% 7.0% 140bps\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%)(b)\n12.4% 12.0% (40)bps\nAverage Selling Price $ 51.78 $ 51.76 0%\nUnits Sold (6)%\nReturn Rate(c) 15.4% 14.6% (80)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 996 $ 967 (3)%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 61.6% 63.6% 200bps\nMobile % of eCommerce\nRevenue(e) 69.0% 70.7% 170bps\nLTM Total Customers(f) 8.2 7.9 (4)%\nQVC International\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 63.4% 64.6% 120bps\nOperating Income Margin (%) 10.9% 10.0% (90)bps\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%) 13.3% 12.3% (100)bps\nAverage Selling Price (3)% (3)%\nUnits Sold 1%\nReturn Rate(c) 19.6% 18.9% (70)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 283 $ 297 5% 5%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 49.0% 52.0% 300bps\nMobile % of eCommerce\nRevenue(e) 69.3% 76.1% 680bps\nLTM Total Customers(f) 4.2 4.0 (5)%\nCornerstone\nCost of Goods Sold % of Revenue 62.8% 59.9% (290)bps\nOperating Income Margin (%) 1.4% NM NM\nAdjusted OIBDA Margin (%) 3.9% 2.4% (150)bps\neCommerce Revenue(d) $ 218 $ 188 (14)%\neCommerce % of Total Revenue 76.5% 74.6% (190)bps\n________________________________________\na)For a definition of constant currency financial metrics, see the accompanying schedules.\nb)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of Rocky Mount\nin February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21 million of restructuring,\npenalty and fire-related costs.

A portion of expected cost savings are included in\nAdjusted EBITDA for purposes of the covenant calculations under QVC’s bank credit\nfacility.\nCash at Qurate Retail decreased $337 million in the third quarter primarily due to net debt\nrepayment and capital expenditures during the period. On September 26, 2024, QVC\ncompleted an offer in which 89% of its 4.75% senior secured notes due 2027 and 4.375%\nsenior secured notes due 2028 were tendered. The transaction was funded by $605 million\nof new 6.875% senior secured notes due 2029 and $352 million of cash. Total debt at\nQurate Retail decreased $299 million in the third quarter due to the repurchase of QVC’s\n2027 and 2028 senior secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the new 2029 senior\nsecured notes and additional net borrowing under QVC’s bank credit facility.\nQVC’s bank credit facility has $1.3 billion drawn as of September 30, 2024 with incremental\navailability of $1.8 billion, net of letters of credit.

Pursuant to the terms of QVC’s\nrevolving credit facility, a portion of expected cost savings are included in operating income\nfor purposes of QVC’s leverage ratio for covenant calculations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, QVC’s consolidated leverage ratio (as calculated under QVC’s\nsenior secured notes) was greater than 3.5x and as a result QVC is restricted in its ability to\nmake unlimited dividends or other restricted payments. Dividends made by QVC to service\nthe principal and interest of indebtedness of its parent entities, as well as payments made by\nQVC to Qurate Retail under an intercompany tax sharing agreement in respect of certain tax\nobligations of QVC and its subsidiaries, are permitted under the bond indenture and credit\nagreement.\nQurate Retail is in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nImportant Notice: Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB, QRTEP) will discuss\nQurate Retail’s earnings release on a conference call which will begin at 8:30 a.m. (E.T.) on\nNovember 7, 2024.

The call will also be\nbroadcast live across the Internet and archived on our website. To access the webcast go to\nhttps://www.qurateretail.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar. Links to this press release\nand replays of the call will also be available on Qurate Retail’s website.\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements, including statements about\nbusiness strategies and initiatives (including Project Athens and Cornerstone’s\ntransformation plan) and their expected benefits, market potential, future financial\nperformance and prospects and other matters that are not historical facts. These forward-\nlooking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without\nlimitation, possible changes in market acceptance of new products or services, competitive\nissues, regulatory matters affecting our businesses, continued access to capital on terms\nacceptable to Qurate Retail, changes in law and government regulations, the availability of\ninvestment opportunities, general market conditions (including as a result of future public\nhealth crises), issues impacting the global supply chain and labor market and use of social\nmedia and influencers. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this\npress release, and Qurate Retail expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to\ndisseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to\nreflect any change in Qurate Retail's expectations with regard thereto or any change in\nevents, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to\nthe publicly filed documents of Qurate Retail, including the most recent Forms 10-K and 10-\nQ, for additional information about Qurate Retail and about the risks and uncertainties\nrelated to Qurate Retail's business which may affect the statements made in this press\nrelease.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press\nrelease includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure,\nfor Qurate Retail, QVC (and certain of its subsidiaries) and Cornerstone together with a\nreconciliation to that entity or such businesses’ operating income, as determined under\nGAAP. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation\nand amortization, stock-based compensation, and where applicable, separately identified\nimpairments, litigation settlements, restructuring, penalties, acquisition-related costs, fire\nrelated costs, net (including Rocky Mount inventory losses), and (gains) losses on sale\nleaseback transactions. Further, this press release includes Adjusted OIBDA margin, which\nis also a non-GAAP financial measure. Qurate Retail defines Adjusted OIBDA margin as\nAdjusted OIBDA divided by revenue.\nQurate Retail believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength\nand performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection\nof each business’s performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this\nmeasure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons\nand benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance.\nBecause Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Qurate Retail\nviews operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is\nnot meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather\nto supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information\nthat Qurate Retail's management considers in assessing the results of operations and\nperformance of its assets. Please see the attached schedules for applicable reconciliations.\nThis press release also references certain financial metrics on a constant currency basis,\nwhich is a non-GAAP measure, for Qurate Retail. Constant currency financial metrics, as\npresented herein, are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported\namounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency.\nQurate Retail believes constant currency financial metrics are an important indicator of\nfinancial performance, in particular for QVC, due to the translational impact of foreign\ncurrency fluctuations relating to its subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan. We use\nconstant currency financial metrics to provide a framework to assess how our businesses\nperformed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Please see the\nfinancial tables at the beginning of this press release for a reconciliation of the impact of\nforeign currency fluctuations on revenue, operating income, Adjusted OIBDA and average\nselling price.\nSCHEDULE 1\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Qurate Retail’s Adjusted OIBDA to its\noperating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September\n30, 2024, respectively.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA RECONCILIATION\n(amounts in millions) 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\nQurate Retail Operating Income\n(Loss) $ 151 $ (103) $ 145 $ 165 $ 152\nDepreciation and amortization 105 98 99 96 95\nStock compensation expense 10 13 16 3 3\nRestructuring, penalty and fire related\ncosts, net of (recoveries) (including\nRocky Mount inventory losses)(a) 19 — — 18 —\nImpairment of intangible assets(b) — 326 — — —\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and\nsale leaseback transactions(c) — 6 (1) — —\nQurate Retail Adjusted OIBDA $ 285 $ 340 $ 259 $ 282 $ 250\n________________________________________\na)In the third quarter of 2023, QxH incurred (i) a $2 million gain on the sale of its Rocky\nMount fulfillment center in February 2023 on proceeds released from escrow and (ii) $21\nmillion of restructuring, penalty and fire-related costs.
