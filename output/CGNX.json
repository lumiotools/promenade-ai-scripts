These include special items such as restructuring charges, acquisition and integration charges, and amortization of\nacquisition-related intangible assets, all of which are subject to limitations in predictability of timing, ultimate outcome and numerous conditions outside of Cognex’s control. Additionally, these items are\noutside of Cognex’s normal business operations and not used by management to assess Cognex’s operating results. Cognex believes these limitations would result in a range of projected values so broad\nas to not be meaningful to investors. For these reasons, Cognex believes that the probable significance of such information is low. Please see the appendix of this presentation for a description of certain\nNon-GAAP measures and a full GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation\n9 © 2024 Cognex Corporation\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated the\nmargin, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net calculation of our non-GAAP measures to exclude\nincome, adjusted earnings per share of common stock, diluted, adjusted effective tax rate, and acquisition and integration costs and amortization of\nfree cash flow.

          "content": "Cognex Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nOctober 30, 2024―NATICK, MA—Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ: CGNX) today reported financial\nresults for the third quarter of 2024. Table 1 below shows selected financial data for Q3-24 compared with\nQ3-23 and Q2-24.\n“Cognex generated third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in line with our guidance,\" said\nRobert J. Willett, CEO. \"Revenue grew year-on-year on both a reported basis and excluding Moritex, led\nby continued strength in our Logistics and Semiconductor end markets. However, conditions across our\nbroader factory automation business remain soft, with a further step-down in Automotive.\"\nMr. Willett continued, “We made good strides in innovation, rolling out additional out-of-the-box AI features\nthat are enhancing our products. We also continue to see our Emerging Customer initiative ramp well and\nattract many new customers.\"\nDennis Fehr, CFO, added, “In this prolonged soft macro environment, we tightly managed costs and\nworking capital. Despite a ramp in strategic investments, we delivered a sequential decrease in operating\nexpenses. Combined with working capital efficiencies, this led to our highest quarterly operating cash flow\nand free cash flow since Q4-2022.”\nTable 1\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCurrent Prior Year Prior\nQuarter Quarter Y/Y Quarter Q/Q\nQ3-24 Q3-23 Change Q2-24 Change\nRevenue $235 $197 +19% $239 -2%\nOperating Income $32 $31 +3% $38 -18%\n% of Revenue 13.4% 15.5% (209 bps) 16.1% (262 bps)\nAdjusted EBITDA* $41 $34 +20% $48 -13%\n% of Revenue 17.6% 17.4% +19 bps 19.9% (232 bps)\nNet Income per Diluted Share $0.17 $0.11 +57% $0.21 -18%\nAdjusted EPS (Diluted)* $0.20 $0.17 +19% $0.23 -13%\nNote: Numbers shown may not foot due to rounding.\n*Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS (Diluted) exclude Non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation from GAAP to Non-\nGAAP metrics is provided in this news release.\nDetails of the Quarter\nStatement of Operations Highlights – Third Quarter of 2024\n• As previously noted, results include four months of financials for Moritex, which was acquired by\nCognex in October 2023, as we aligned Moritex's accounting close schedule with the Cognex close\nschedule in the quarter.\n• Revenue grew by 19% from Q3-23. Excluding the 12 percentage point contribution to revenue growth\nby Moritex, revenue increased by 7%. The year-on-year increase in revenue excluding Moritex was\ndriven by strong growth in our Logistics and Semiconductor businesses as well as the timing of\nConsumer Electronics revenue. Sequentially, revenue decreased by 2% from Q2-24, or 5% excluding\nMoritex, primarily due to the seasonality of Consumer Electronics revenue.\n• Gross margin was 67.9% for Q3-24 compared to 72.4% for Q3-23 and 69.6% for Q2-24. We recorded\n$2 million in amortization of intangible assets and other acquisition charges in cost of revenue in Q3-\n24, primarily related to the Moritex acquisition. Adjusted gross margin was 68.7% for Q3-24 compared\nto 72.7% for Q3-23 and 70.3% for Q2-24. The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by an\napproximately 3 percentage point dilution effect from Moritex while negative mix and pricing\ncontributed to the sequential decline.\n• Operating expenses of $128 million increased by 14% from Q3-23 and were slightly down from Q2-\n24. We recorded $3 million in amortization of intangible assets, integration costs, and other\nacquisition charges in operating expenses in Q3-24, primarily related to the Moritex acquisition.\nAdjusted operating expenses of $125 million in Q3-24 increased by 10% from Q3-23 and were\nslightly down from Q2-24. The year-on-year increase was driven by expenses related to Moritex, our\ninvestment in the Emerging Customer initiative, and incentive compensation, partly offset by lower\nheadcount excluding Moritex and the Emerging Customer initiative, as well as disciplined cost\nmanagement.\n• Net Income of $30 million increased by 56% from Q3-23 and declined by 18% from Q2-24. Adjusted\nNet Income of $34 million in Q3-24 increased by 19% from Q3-23 and declined by 13% from Q2-24.\nThe year-on-year increase in Adjusted Net Income was primarily driven by the contribution from\nMoritex.\n• The effective tax rate was 19% in Q3-24 and 30% in Q3-23. Excluding discrete tax items and the tax\nimpact of non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate was 18% in both periods.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights – September 29, 2024\n• Cognex’s financial position as of September 29, 2024 continued to be strong, with $607 million in\ncash and investments and no debt as of September 29, 2024.\n• In Q3-24, Cognex generated $56 million of cash from operating activities and $52 million in free cash\nflow, a $15 million and $17 million improvement year-on-year, respectively.\n• The company spent $4 million to repurchase its common stock and paid $13 million in dividends to\nshareholders. Cognex intends to continue to repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to its\nexisting stock repurchase program, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors.\nFinancial Outlook – Fourth Quarter of 2024\n• Cognex expects revenue to be between $210 million and $230 million. This range represents a\nsequential decrease in revenue from Q3-24 to Q4-24 driven by Consumer Electronics seasonality\nand one fewer month of Moritex financials. Year-on-year, at the midpoint, this represents a low-\ndouble-digit increase on a reported basis, or a high-single-digit increase, excluding Moritex, driven by\ncontinued growth in Logistics and Semi. We expect the Moritex business to contribute 6 to 8 percent\nof revenue in Q4-24.\n• Adjusted gross margin1 is expected to be in the high 60 percent range. Mix as well as competitive\npricing are expected to be sequential headwinds, partially offset by the favorable impact of one fewer\nmonth of Moritex financials.\n• Adjusted EBITDA margin1 is expected to be between 14% and 17%. This represents a 3 percentage\npoint increase year-on-year at the midpoint driven by expected continued tight management of\noperating expenses and positive operating leverage slightly offset by lower gross margin and\ninvestment in the Emerging Customer initiative.\n• The adjusted effective tax rate1 is expected to be 16%.\n1Cognex has provided the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of adjusted gross margin, adjusted\nEBITDA margin, and adjusted effective tax rate, but cannot, without unreasonable effort, forecast such\nitems to present or provide a reconciliation to corresponding forecasted GAAP measures. These include\nspecial items such as restructuring charges, acquisition and integration charges, and amortization of\nacquisition-related intangible assets, all of which are subject to limitations in predictability of timing,\nultimate outcome and numerous conditions outside of Cognex’s control. Additionally, these items are\noutside of Cognex’s normal business operations and not used by management to assess Cognex’s\noperating results. Cognex believes these limitations would result in a range of projected values so broad\nas to not be meaningful to investors. For these reasons, Cognex believes that the probable significance of\nsuch information is low. Information with respect to special items for certain historical periods is included\nin the section entitled “Reconciliation of Selected Items From GAAP to Non-GAAP”.\nAnalyst Conference Call and Simultaneous Webcast\n• Cognex will host a conference call on October 31, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).\nThe telephone number is (877) 704-4573 (or (201) 389-0911 if outside the United States).\n• A real-time audio broadcast of the conference call or an archived recording, together with a slide\npresentation, will be accessible on the Events & Presentations page of the Cognex Investor website:\nwww.cognex.com/investor.\nCOGNEX CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 29, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 197,075 $ 202,655\nCurrent investments, amortized cost of $91,658 and $132,799 in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, allowance for credit losses of $0 in 2024 and 2023 90,803 129,392\nAccounts receivable, allowance for credit losses of $604 and $583 in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively 157,968 114,164\nUnbilled revenue 2,117 2,402\nInventories 155,278 162,285\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 68,841 68,099\nTotal current assets 672,082 678,997\nNon-current investments, amortized cost of $318,268 and $250,790 in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, allowance for credit losses of $0 in 2024 and 2023 319,287 244,230\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 103,177 105,849\nOperating lease assets 72,433 75,115\nGoodwill 391,673 393,181\nIntangible assets, net 102,550 112,952\nDeferred income taxes 395,205 400,400\nOther assets 6,840 7,088\nTotal assets $ 2,063,247 $ 2,017,812\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 29,984 $ 21,454\nAccrued expenses 76,675 72,374\nAccrued income taxes 24,226 16,907\nDeferred revenue and customer deposits 30,045 31,525\nOperating lease liabilities 9,806 9,624\nTotal current liabilities 170,736 151,884\nNon-current operating lease liabilities 67,375 68,977\nDeferred income taxes 230,368 246,877\nReserve for income taxes 26,491 26,685\nNon-current accrued income taxes — 18,338\nOther liabilities 1,251 299\nTotal liabilities 496,221 513,060\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 10)\nShareholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $.01 par value – Authorized: 400 shares in 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively;

Cognex\ndefines its non-GAAP metrics as follows:\n• Adjusted gross margin: Gross margin adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible\nassets, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs and other\none-time discrete events, such as loss or recovery related to a fire.\n• Adjusted operating expense: Operating expense adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs\nand other one-time discrete events, such as loss or recovery related to a fire.\n• Adjusted operating income: Operating income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs\nand other one-time discrete events, such as loss or recovery related to a fire.\n• Adjusted EBITDA: Operating income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible\nassets and depreciation, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, acquisition and\nintegration costs and other one-time discrete events, such as loss or recovery related to a fire.\n• Adjusted net income: Net income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible\nassets, as well as, if applicable, restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs and other\none-time discrete events, such as loss or recovery related to a fire or a foreign currency (gain)\nloss on a forward contract to hedge the Moritex purchase price.\n• Adjusted earnings per share of common stock, diluted: Adjusted net income divided by diluted\nweighted average common and common-equivalent shares.\n• Adjusted effective tax rate: Effective tax rate adjusted for discrete tax items and the net impact of\nthe other non-GAAP adjustments.\n• Free cash flow: Cash provided by operating activities less cash for capital expenditures.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated the calculation of our non-GAAP measures to\nexclude acquisition and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. These\nchanges have been applied retrospectively to the third quarter of 2023 and the nine month period ending\nOctober 1, 2023. Cognex also uses results on a constant-currency basis as one measure to evaluate its\nperformance and compares results between periods as if the exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod-over-period.\nCognex believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful because they allow investors to more\naccurately compare results over multiple periods using the same methodology that management employs\nin its budgeting process, in its review of operating results, and for forecasting and planning for future\nperiods. Cognex’s definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore\ncomparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics.\nFurthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain\nnon-recurring expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary\nto run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as\nsubstitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease see the section “Reconciliation of Selected Items from GAAP to Non-GAAP” below for more\ndetailed information regarding non-GAAP financial measures herein, including the items reflected in our\nadjusted financial metrics and a description of these adjustments.\nCOGNEX CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF SELECTED ITEMS FROM GAAP TO NON-GAAP\nDollars in thousands, except per share amounts (Unaudited)\nThree-months Ended Nine-months Ended\nSeptember June 30, October 1, September October 1,\n29, 2024 2024 2023 29, 2024 2023\nGross margin (GAAP) ............................................................... $ 159,399 $ 166,599 $ 142,774 $ 467,935 $ 466,197\nAcquisition and integration costs .................................... 281 233 — 2,082 —\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets ... 1,640 1,388 550 4,457 1,849\nAdjusted gross margin .............................................................. $ 161,320 $ 168,220 $ 143,324 $ 474,474 $ 468,046\nGAAP gross margin percent of revenue 67.9 % 69.6 % 72.4 % 68.3 % 72.7 %\nAdjusted gross margin percent of revenue 68.7 % 70.3 % 72.7 % 69.3 % 73.0 %\nOperating expense (GAAP)...................................................... $ 127,835 $ 128,142 $ 112,137 $ 383,710 $ 348,224\n(Loss) recovery from fire .................................................. — — 2,750 — 5,250\nAcquisition and integration costs ....................................

Adjustments\nincorporated in the preparation of these non-GAAP measures for the periods presented include the items\ndescribed below:\nDepreciation:\n• The company incurs expense related to its normal use of property, plant and equipment.\nLoss (recovery) from fire:\n• On June 7, 2022, the Company’s primary contract manufacturer experienced a fire at its plant in\nIndonesia. During the nine-month period ended October 1, 2023, the Company recorded\nrecoveries related to the fire of $5,250,000, consisting of $2,500,000 in the second quarter of\n2023 for proceeds received from the Company's insurance carrier in relation to a business\ninterruption claim and $2,750,000 in the third quarter of 2023 for proceeds received as part of a\nfinancial settlement for lost inventory and other losses incurred as a result of the fire.\nManagement does not anticipate additional recoveries.\nAcquisition and integration costs:\n• The Company has incurred charges related to the purchase and integration of acquired\nbusinesses. During the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, these costs were primarily\nrelated to the ongoing integration of Moritex Corporation.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets:\n• The Company excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP expense\nand income measures. These items are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are\nsignificantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and include the amortization of\ncustomer relationships, completed technologies, and trademarks that originated from prior\nacquisitions. The largest driver of intangible asset amortization was the acquisition of Moritex\nCorporation.\nDiscrete tax (benefit) expense:\n• Items unrelated to current period ordinary income or (loss) that generally relate to changes in tax\nlaws, adjustments to prior period’s actual liability determined upon filing tax returns, adjustments\nto previously recorded reserves for uncertain tax positions, and initially recording or fully reversing\nvaluation allowances.\n• We estimate the tax effect of items identified in the reconciliation by applying the statutory tax rate\nto the pre-tax amount.\nCertain statements made in this release, as well as oral statements made by the Company from time to time, constitute forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended.
