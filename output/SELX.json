Semilux’s actual results may differ from its expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “might” and “continues,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, the expected use of proceeds, Semilux’s continued growth and expansion and its ability to deliver value to customers and investors, along with those other risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by Semilux with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 12, 2024, the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed by Semilux with the SEC on May 15, 2024 and those that are included in any of Semilux’s future filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Most of these factors are outside of the control of Semilux and are difficult to predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Semilux undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made except as required by law or applicable regulation._\n\n**For investor and media inquiries, please contact:**\n\n**Semilux International Ltd.** Investor Relations DepartmentEmail: IR@semilux.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTcwZTA4MDQtNWJlZS00MDYzLTk3N2UtZjA3Y2ZhNWZmMDI1LTUwMDEyNDc0NA==/tiny/Semilux-International-Ltd-.png)\n\n[More Press Releases](/pressreleases)\n"

-as software building blocks, called IP Cores -for wide use\nProperty (IP) Cores\nElectronic Design • Engineers design chips (adding their own designs on top of any IP cores bought/licensed) using specialized Electronic Design Automation\nAutomation (EDA) (EDA) software\nTools • Large engineering teams use these EDA tools and may spend multiple years to design a complex logic chip\nIntegrated Device • Companies in this segment design, manufacture (in their fabs), and sell their own chips (they do not make chips for other companies)\nManufacturers (IDMs) • They have their own fabrication plants (or “fabs”) but may also use foundries\n• These companies create chip designs (using IP Cores and their own designs) and send the designs to “foundries” that have “fabs” that\n“Fabless” Chip manufacture them\nCompanies • Companies like SemiLux in this segment are more focused on design, and benefit from higher margins, stability and lower capital\nrequirements\nChip Foundries / • Companies in this segment do not design the chips but manufacture, assemble or test chips for companies that have their own designs\nAssembly & Test • Specialized third-party manufacturers / testers that perform wafer fabrication or back-end processing for others on a contract basis\nODM / OEM / Tier-1 • OEM system houses need chip solutions to help them solve their various difficulties\nSupplies • Chip vendors sample their devices to OEMs, and are awarded design wins as the OEM designs the part into their systems\nBrands to End\n• Companies in this segment market branded products to end customers\nCustomers\nSemiLux can achieve rapid growth by focusing on superior chip design and partnering with ODMs/OEMs and Tier-1 partners\nthat have strong relationships with auto makers around the

The\nLiDARserves as essential safetyredundancy for the L3 autonomous driving system.\nWebelieve thattheCompany controls the designof chipsetused in the LiDAR andADBproducts will be in a\nposition to gain from the adoption of autonomous vehicles, as they control the most fundamental technologies\nandbuilding blocks of LiDARandADBproducts.\n(1) Source: https://site.eettaiwan.com/events/iov2020/download/p05.%20%E6%AD%90%E7%9B%9F%E8%87%AA%E9%A7%95%E8%BB%8A%E8%AA%8D%E8%AD%89%E6%B3%95%E8%A6%8F%E4%BB%8B%E7%B4%B9.pdf\n17\nSTRENGTHS OF Global Top 10 IC Design Company(1)\nUSD $M\n2021 Rank 2020 Rank Company 2021 Revenue 2020 Revenue YoY\nAuto manufacturers purchase\nOUR BUSINESS\n1 1 Qualcomm $29,333 $19,407 51%\nSemiLux products from OEMs\n2 3 NVIDIA $24,885 $15,412 61%\nMODEL 3 2 Broadcom $21,026 $17,745 18% such as Foxconn and Pegatron\n4 4 MediaTek $17,619 $10,929 61%\n5 5 AMD $16,434 $9,763 68%\n6 8 Novatek $4,836 $2,709 79%\nWhen unique or special\n7 7 Marvell $4,281 $2,942 46%\n8 9 Realtek $3,767 $2,635 43% customization is required,\nDifferentiated products based on advanced\n9 6 Xilinx $3,677 $3,053 20%\nSemiLux can work directly with\ntechnologies and benefit from Taiwan’s strong 10 - Himax $1,547 $888 74%\n- 10 Dia10R - $1,376 0% the auto manufacturers\nsemiconductor industry.\nTop 10 Total $127,405 $85,971 48%\nFabless Taiwanese semiconductor companies that experienced rapid growth using a similar capital-light business model to\nSemiLux/ TCO\nCurrent LiDAR Suppliers are mostly system\nproduct design experts\nSupplying Integrated Chips with Reference Design,\nCase Studies\nleading to system product\nWe offer OEMs a comprehensive range of services,\nMediaTek competed with Qualcomm, the leading\nNovatek Microelectronics supplies LCD & Panel\n(1) optimized IC and references supplier of handset ICs and the top position in the\nOEM/ODMs for greater market share, rather than\nbaseband market, and was able to gain market share\n(2) modified software and hardware designs selling directly to electronic brands (3)\nby finding a niche as a fabless chip designer (2)\n(3) new IC specifications\n(4) iterative IC testing\n(1) TrendForce\n(2) Source: https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210325-10735.html\n(3) Source: https://www.novatek.com.tw/en-global/Product/product/Overview 18\nA RAPIDLY GROWING AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR\nAutomotive Sales (USD $B) Vehicle Sales by SAE(1) Level (% of Vehicles)\n1 2\n9\n10\n$3,800\n21\n43\n$3,027\n$2,755\n52\n23\n70\n18\n32\n17\n2020 2025E 2030E 2019 2025E 2030E\nAutomotive Sales Level 0 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4\nA combination of increasing automotive sales and a trend towards more autonomous driving and advanced safety features\nmay lead to an increased demand for SemiLux’s LiDAR and ADB products\n(1) Society of Automotive Engineers\nSource: McKinsey & Company, “Outlook on the automotive software and electronics market through 2030”\n19\nMASSIVE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET\nUnderlying Secular Tailwinds\n• Changing customer preferences and regulations that prioritize safety are\nGlobal Market Size 2025E\nleading to greater adoption of autonomous-driving and advanced driver\n$11.6B\nassistance systems\n• With increasing urbanization, there is a rising need for LiDAR technology to\nADB Market Size 2025E\nhelp in city planning and transportation management\n$3.5B\n• We expect that ongoing research and development are leading to lower\nproducts costs, which will lead to even greater adoption of LiDAR systems\nLiDAR Market Size 2025E\n$4.4B\nSemiLux’s product offerings target a ~$19.5B annual global market (1)\n20\n(1) YoleIntelligence Report\nII.
