It aims to offer capital appreciation for investors through exposure to the S&P 500.\n\nAs a Calamos Structured Protection ETF, CPSN offers complete downside protection during its one-year outcome period, after fees and expenses. This investment security comes with an upside cap on potential return.\n\nLike other Calamos Structured Protection ETFs, CPSN executes its strategy using FLEX options. These options enable the fund to simultaneously seek returns while defending against potential risk.\n\nAt the conclusion of CPSN’s one-year outcome period, the fund will select new FLEX Options to invest in. If the ETF gets held for longer than a year, CPSN can provide notable tax alpha from long-term capital gains rates.\n\n## **A Timely Investment**\n\nThis fund is available at a very opportune moment for equity investors. In less than a week, the United States will undergo the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe results of this election will likely shape the near future for U.S. economic policy. Regardless of the outcome, equity investors should expect the election to cause some degree of volatility in the market.\n\nMoments like these are where Calamos funds like CPSN can really shine. CPSN’s high degree of downside security can protect one’s investment from near-term and long-term election volatility. Meanwhile, the fund’s FLEX Options allow investors to stay engaged in potential upside from the S&P 500.\n\nCalamos Investments is continuing to innovate by launching new Structured Outcome ETFs on a monthly basis. One of the more recent Calamos additions is the [Calamos Laddered S&P 500 Structured Protection ETF (CPSL)](https://www.calamos.com/funds/etf/calamos-laddered-sp-500-structured-alt-protection-cpsl/). This fund offers access to a laddered portfolio of Calamos S&P 500 Structured Protection ETFs, including CPSN.\n\n_For more news, information, and strategy, visit the_[** _Alternatives Channel_**](https://www.etftrends.com/alternatives-channel/) _._\n\n## Disclosure Information\n\n**_Before investing, carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

After the conclusion of an outcome period, another will begin.​\n\n**FUND-OF-FUNDS RISK.** Shareholders of the Fund will experience investment returns that are different than the investment returns provided by an Underlying ETF. The Fund does not itself pursue a defined outcome strategy, nor does the Fund itself provide downside protection against SPY losses. Because the Fund will typically not purchase an Underlying ETF on the first day of a Target Outcome Period, it is not likely that the stated outcome of the Underlying ETF will be realized by the Fund. The Fund will be continuously exposed to the investment profiles of each of the Underlying ETFs during their respective Target Outcome Periods. The Fund, with its aggregate exposure to each of the Underlying ETFs, may have investment returns that are inferior to that of any single Underlying ETF or group of Underlying ETFs over any given time period. In between the semi-annual rebalance period of the Index, because the Fund is not equally weighted on a continuous basis, the Fund may be exposed to one or more Underlying ETFs disproportionately when compared to other Underlying ETFs. In such circumstances, the Fund will be subject to the over-weighted performance of such Underlying ETF. \n\nAs a shareholder in other ETFs, the Fund bears its proportionate share of each ETF’s expenses, subjecting Fund shareholders to duplicative expenses. \n\n**There are no assurances the Underlying ETFs will be successful in providing the sought-after protection. The outcomes that the Underlying ETFs seek to provide may only be realized if you are holding shares on the first day of the outcome period and continue to hold them on the last day of the outcome period, approximately one year. There is no guarantee that the outcomes for an outcome period will be realized or that the Underlying ETFs will achieve its investment objective. If the outcome period has begun and the underlying ETF has increased in value, any appreciation of the Fund(s) by virtue of increases in the underlying ETF since the commencement of the outcome period will not be protected by the sought-after protection, and an investor could experience losses until the underlying ETF returns to the original price at the commencement of the outcome period. The Underlying ETFs are subject to an upside return cap (the “Cap”) that represents the maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the fund(s) for the outcome period, before fees and expenses. If the outcome period has begun and the Underlying ETFs have increased in value to a level near to their individual Cap, an investor purchasing at that price has little or no ability to achieve gains but remains vulnerable to downside risks. Additionally, the Cap may rise or fall from one outcome period to the next. Unlike the Underlying ETFs, the Fund itself does not pursue a target outcome strategy. The protection is only provided by the Underlying ETFs and the Fund itself does not provide any stated downside protection against losses. The Fund will likely not receive the full benefit of the Underlying ETF downside protections and could have limited upside potential. The Fund’s returns are limited by the caps of the Underlying ETFs.**\n\n## Additional Information\n\n**FLEX Options Risk** The Fund will utilize FLEX Options issued and guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Fund could suffer significant losses. Additionally, FLEX Options may be less liquid than standard options. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the Fund may have difficulty closing out certain FLEX Options positions at desired times and prices. The values of FLEX Options do not increase or decrease at the same rate as the reference asset and may vary due to factors other than the price of reference asset.​\n\nShares are bought and sold at market price, not net asset value (NAV), and are not individually redeemable from the fund. NAV represents the value of each share’s portion of the fund’s underlying assets and cash at the end of the trading day. Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where fund shares are listed.​\n\n## **100% capital protection is over a one-year period before fees and expenses. All caps are pre-determined.** ​\n\n**Cap Range – Maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund if held over the Outcome Period. Cap range depicted is the high and low cap rate over the past 15 trading days. Actual cap delivered by the Fund may be different.** ​\n\n**Protection Level – Amount of protection the Fund is designed to achieve over the Days Remaining.** ​\n\n**Outcome Period – Number of days in the Outcome Period.** ​\n\nThe “S&P 500®” is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC or its affiliates (“SPDJI”), and has been licensed for use by Calamos Advisors LLC (“Calamos Advisors”).

          "content": "OCTOBER 2024\n3 Reflections on Private Credit\nImagine an asset class that’s designed to boost returns, reduce risk and open doors to opportunities beyond traditional markets.\nThis is the influence of private credit – a strategy once exclusive to institutional investors is now accessible to everyone including\nretail investors. With its growing popularity and accessibility, the asset class reached nearly $2 trillion at the end of 2023, roughly\nten times larger than it was in 20091.\nAs we look toward the future, we are eager to share three pivotal takeaways on the opportunities in private credit and the\npotential for investors willing to explore the asset class.\n1). Investing across the spectrum is advantageous for diversification\nPrivate credit’s rapid expansion into a broadly diversified asset class should not be underestimated. From litigation finance to\ninfrastructure lending and healthcare royalties, private credit has evolved into a market that extends well beyond traditional\ndirect lending.\nOur stance on the private credit landscape emphasizes the importance of broad sector diversification rather than concentrating\nexposure and risk on a specific area of the market. The Calamos Aksia Alternative Credit and Income Fund (CAPIX) accesses\nspecialized lending across six distinct sectors.\nIn dark blue, we highlight direct lending as a core position within a portfolio, however, it is only one segment of an expanding\nprivate credit market. Everything to the right of that, in light blue, we view as complementary sectors relative to direct lending from\na spread, collateral, and diversification perspective. Altogether, we aim to balance exposures across these areas to build a more\nrobust, “all-weather” portfolio that is not tied to any one risk factor.\nFIGURE 1: PRIVATE CREDIT MAP\nDistressed\nDirect Debt and Specialty Real Estate Real Assets\nMezzanine\nLending Special Finance Credit Credit\nSituations\nUS direct lending “Credit Consumer and SME US corporate real Infrastructure lending US mezzanine\nopportunities” lending estate (CRE lending:\nEuropean direct Energy credit European mezzanine\nlending Corporate distressed Rediscount lending core transitional,\nbridge lending) Trade finance Structured equity\nEmerging markets Opportunistic Factoring and\ndirect lending structured credit receivables European CRE Metals and mining PIK Holdco\nlending finance\nRegulatory capital\nReal estate distressed\nrelief Emerging markets Agricultural credit\nSome private NPLs Royalties* CRE lending Transportation\ncredit registered Capital solutions/ Venture lending CRE structured credit\nfunds may have rescue finance\nTechnology lending Residential\na narrow focus “Special situations” mortgages\non US direct loans Financial services credit\nlending. Insurance-linked credit\nLitigation finance\nStretch ABL\nNAV loans\nStructured secondaries\n*Includes Music/Film/Media; Oil & Gas Minerals; Metals; Healthcare Lending & Royalties\n1 McKinsey & Company: The next era of private credit\n2). Supply/demand dynamics are shifting\nWhile 2023 marked the “golden age” for direct lending, the supply/demand imbalance that made it a compelling market\nenvironment, driven by constrained capital markets activity, has reversed (see below). Increased activity from the broadly\nsyndicated loan (BSL) market has led to a sharp retrench where loans are pricing significantly tighter than they were last year.\nUltimately, increased competition has impacted the value proposition within direct lending, highlighting the potential benefits\nof CAPIX flexibility and our ability to diversify risk across various private credit sectors.\nFIGURE 2: BROADLY SYNDICATED LOANS (BSL) AND DIRECT LENDING TAKEOUTS ($B)\nDirect Lending Refinanced by BSL BSL Refinanced by Direct Lending\n$12B\n$12B\n$10B\n$10B $9B\n$8B\n$7B\n$6B $5B\n$4B\n$3B\n$2B\n$1B $1B $1B\n$0B $0B $0B\n$0B\n11QQ 22002233 2Q 2023 3Q 2023 4Q 2023 1Q 2024 2Q 2024\nSource: Pitchbook/LCD.\nOutside direct lending, many sectors are offering lender-friendly dynamics which can include attractive pricing and enhanced\nportfolio diversification benefits. As a result, the Fund has continued to source attractive investment opportunities in other\nareas of the market. We highlight asset-backed opportunities in the wake of new banking regulations, such as unique\nareas within specialty finance (e.g., regulatory capital relief deals, structured secondaries and NAV loans), real asset lending\n(e.g., infrastructure and transportation assets), and capital solutions - where bespoke financing can help high quality but\noverleveraged businesses pay down burdensome senior debt or make accretive add-on acquisitions.\n3). Not all private credit funds are created equal\nWith its broad focus, the goal of CAPIX is to take advantage of income opportunities across the full private credit universe,\nallowing our portfolio management team to skillfully allocate to where we believe the best risk/return opportunities lie. To do\nso effectively, the Fund operates with open architecture, enabling loans to be sourced from high conviction private markets\noriginators, each specializing within a specific segment of the asset class.\nAksia’s expansive platform and broad network with managers allows the Fund to generate significant deal flow, in our\nopinion. The broad sourcing network enables CAPIX to be highly selective and adapt to changing market environments.\nAksia’s network of highly skilled managers are those that meet the highest institutional standards, who have deep\nrelationships with private equity sponsors and have established teams. By sourcing loans with high conviction managers, Aksia\ncan build a private credit portfolio of highly diversified loans across sector and industry that seeks to maximize return and\nreduce risk in client allocations.\nOur Approach\nThe breadth of private credit today can offer investors a wide range of sectors with different returns, drivers and collateral\ntypes. Rather than constructing a portfolio with concentrated risk in one sector of private credit, the CAPIX team leverages\nthe full opportunity set to build an optimized “one-stop-shop” private credit solution. We believe a well-structured, diversified\nallocation to private credit can provide enhanced income while increasing the overall stability of an investor’s total portfolio.\nThe Fund’s fundraising success thus far is a testament to that thesis. We want to thank our investors for their confidence and\nsupport over the past 16 months and look forward to what lies ahead of us.\nBefore investing carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and High Yield, Low-Rated or Unrated Securities.
