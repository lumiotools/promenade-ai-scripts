The last\nseveral years have demonstrated how it is less important to be able to predict the future than it is to be\nprepared for whatever might happen, and 2023 was no different.\nThe events of the past year underscored, once again, the critical importance of resiliency. In the world\nof finance, where change is constant and challenges are plentiful, the ability to weather storms and\nconsistently be a beacon of strength is not a luxury—it is a necessity.\nThroughout our 135-year history, Northern Trust has forged a reputation for strength and stability.\nOur unwavering commitment to our principles of service, expertise and integrity, and mission of being\nour clients’ most trusted financial partner have been and will continue to remain persistent. However,\nour success over time has also been rooted in our ability to change to meet the demands, risks and\nexpectations of a rapidly evolving world.\nTo exceed your expectations and those of all stakeholders, we are focused on becoming a more\nconsistently high-performing company that is increasingly resilient, efficient and profitable.\nWe will achieve this through the execution of our refined One Northern Trust strategy. It is this shared\nvision that unites us and differentiates us from others. As One Northern Trust, we will forge a distinctive\npath that leads to setting new standards and surpassing them with audacious resolve for the benefit\nof those we serve.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 2\nTHE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nLooking back at 2023, the markets we operate in fared better than expected, with economic activity\npersevering despite systemic risks. And Northern Trust’s results were sustained in the face of challenges\nthat confronted the industry.\nEntering last year, the risk of recession in Europe and the United States was high. Central banks were\nraising interest rates to quell inflation, which was expected to create substantial headwinds. Defying these\nexpectations, the United States delivered strong economic performance in 2023; European markets\nslowed but maintained positive momentum. Continued growth and moderate inflation have raised the\nodds of an economic “soft landing.”\nHigher interest rates created stress in corners of the banking sector during the first half of last year;\nfailures and forced mergers cast doubt over firms and the industry. Fortunately, the worst cases\nwere resolved, and confidence returned. As always, Northern Trust’s balance sheet and reputation\nremained strong throughout this tumultuous interval.\nAdapting to this changing landscape has required special focus. We utilized scenario analysis to\nimagine the worst to adapt the financial advice we provide to our clients for a more uncertain world.\nPredicting tail events is difficult but preparing for them is essential.\nFinally, the latest generation of artificial intelligence emerged during the year carrying both immense\npromise and potential pitfalls. The technology could be truly transformational, raising productivity\nin a manner that sustains economic progress. But it could also be employed in less noble ways. Societies,\nand the firms that operate within them, will have to balance exuberance and caution as a new paradigm\ntakes form.\nOUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nThrough this operating environment in 2023, our total revenue was flat relative to the prior year. Robust\ngrowth in net interest income was offset by softer trust fees and capital markets revenue. Net interest\nincome (on a fully taxable equivalent) increased 6 percent compared to the prior year due to higher\ninterest rates expanding our net interest margin (on a fully taxable equivalent) by 17 points to 1.56\npercent. Fees were down primarily due to net asset outflows and unfavorable equity and fixed income\nmarkets. Foreign exchange trading income was down 29 percent due to muted client activity levels.\nTotal expenses increased 6 percent. While this reflects improvement over 2022 expense growth levels,\nit remains elevated and further reducing the expense growth rate continues to be a top priority.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 3\nNet income and earnings per share were both down 17 percent and return on average common\nequity was 10 percent. The results of the past few years do not meet our expectations, which further\ngalvanizes our goal of becoming a more consistently high-performing company.\nOur capital levels remained strong with all capital ratios far exceeding those required for classification\nas “well capitalized” under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. We returned $978 million\nto common shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends of $630 million and share repurchases of\n$348 million.\nTHE PATH FORWARD: ONE NORTHERN TRUST\nWe serve our clients better when we deliver the solutions capabilities of the entire firm. One Northern\nTrust reflects a shared vision of how we can deliver for our clients and consistently perform at a\nhigh level for all our stakeholders by working in tight coordination and synchronization across the entire\ncompany. All employees, regardless of their business, group, location or role work toward common\ngoals. Our One Northern Trust strategy, which reflects this fundamental principle, is comprised of three\nintertwined objectives:\nOptimizing growth Strengthening resiliency Driving productivity\nThese objectives will help us sharpen our focus, build on our strengths and eliminate what has not served\nus or stakeholders well in the recent past.\nOPTIMIZING GROWTH\nWe are among a select few financial services organizations that are exclusively focused on providing\nintegrated, holistic solutions for all our clients’ investment needs. Our three interrelated businesses—\nWealth Management, Asset Servicing and Asset Management—not only compete in attractive\nand growing sectors of the financial services industry, but also create a differentiated set of capabilities\nthrough their combination.\nOur strategy focuses on optimizing the composition and nature of growth from our three businesses.\nWe aim to accelerate the growth of our Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses and\nincrease our focus on delivering scalable solutions in our Asset Servicing business.\nWealth Management\nOur Wealth Management business is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United\nStates, with assets under custody and assets under management of $1.03 trillion and $402.5 billion,\nrespectively, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams\nthrough a network of offices in major markets across the U.S., as well as offices in London, Singapore\nand Abu Dhabi.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 4\nWe serve approximately 30% of the Forbes 400 most affluent Americans\nWealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners,\nexecutives, professionals, retirees and established privately held businesses in its target markets.\nIn supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment\nmanagement, custody and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate\nadministration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and\nprivate and business banking. Additionally, we have advisory experts who surround our clients by\nsupporting their goals at every stage of their life cycle.\nWe are particularly excited about the growth trajectory of our family office and ultra-high-net-worth\nsegments. In both segments, we have large and extraordinarily strong franchises, excellent brand\nrecognition and highly differentiated capabilities. We deliver carefully curated content and highly valued\nevents as well as offering a complex of networking communities tailored to meet the interests and needs\nof our family office clients across functions, segments, demographics and geography.\nBest Private Bank for Digital Wealth Planning in North America and\nBest Private Bank for Family Offices and Succession Planning\n– FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP\nAsset Management\nAsset Management delivers investment solutions globally for client segments in Asset Servicing and\nWealth Management. Northern Trust managed $1.43 trillion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2023, making it one\nof the top 20 largest global asset managers, including $1.03 trillion for Asset Servicing clients and\n$402.5 billion for Wealth Management clients. Investment management solutions span active and index-\nbased solutions across equity, fixed income, cash management, multi-asset and alternative asset classes,\nand are delivered through separately managed accounts, ETFs, mutual funds, collective investment\ntrusts, and an array of other investment vehicles.\nNorthern Trust is one of the top 20 largest global asset managers\nLast year, we were pleased that Daniel Gamba joined Northern Trust as president of our Asset\nManagement business. Daniel came from BlackRock, Inc., where he spent 22 years and served as\nco-head of Fundamental Equities and as a member of BlackRock’s Global Operating, Portfolio\nManagement Group Executive and Human Capital committees.\nUnder Daniel’s leadership, our Asset Management strategy focuses on the specific client segments and\nsolutions where we have a long-term track record of delivering risk-adjusted investment performance,\nand successfully compete and win. For example, with approximately $100 billion in assets under\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 5\nmanagement on our Tax Advantaged Equity platform, it is one of the top three largest platforms in the\nmarket, has delivered after tax alpha on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and since inception (2002) basis,\nas of Dec. 31, 2023, and has grown by 17 percent annually for the past five years (2018-2023). Another\nexample is our High Yield capability which achieved top decile performance in 2023, with top quartile\nperformance over three and five years. And, we are reinvesting in private markets strategies offered\nthrough 50 South Capital, our boutique alternatives firm that provides unique, differentiated access to\nthe world’s best private equity, private credit and secondaries investment opportunities.\nAsset Servicing\nAsset Servicing is a leading global provider of custody, fund administration, investment operations\noutsourcing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments,\nfund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors around\nthe globe. On Dec. 31, 2023, total Asset Servicing assets under custody/administration and assets\nunder custody were $14.36 trillion and $10.88 trillion, respectively.\nWe will continue to prioritize the growth of scalable services and products in our Asset Servicing\nbusiness such as our Front Office Solutions (FOS) offering, which has significant sales momentum coming\ninto 2024. This award-winning product provides a full suite of portfolio analytics, investment analysis,\nperformance measurement and research management tools to sophisticated asset owner clients. FOS\nis expanding to Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and has already been selected in the region\nby a growing pool of sovereign-sponsored pension assets in the Middle East, including the Abu Dhabi\nPension Fund.\nFront Office Solutions awarded Best Mobile Strategy Initiative\nand Best Data Management Initiative\n– WATERS TECHNOLOGY\nSignificantly advancing our work on digital modernization we launched our A-Suite Community,\nwhich brings together insights, research and networking opportunities for asset owners worldwide to\nlearn, collaborate and move the needle on issues that matter most to them. Already, more than 5,000\nare actively contributing to this community.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 6\nSTRENGTHENING RESILIENCY\nNorthern Trust plays a critical role in the global financial system, facilitating the efficient allocation of\ncapital, managing risks and promoting economic growth. Market participants and regulators look to us\nto have the strongest risk management and controls possible—for the benefit of our clients, the health\nof our industry and the stability of the global economy.\nResiliency signifies our ability to prevent internal stress, recover from external stress and thrive in altered\ncircumstances. In other words, it is about consistently outperforming in both business-as-usual and\nstressed market conditions. Resiliency as a concept is not new to us; it is part of our core value proposition\nto clients. However, the bar is rising due to the pace of change in the environment in which we operate\nand the increasing expectations of our stakeholders. To meet these challenges, we are building on our\nhistorical strengths to ensure that our risks and controls can confidently identify, assess and mitigate\npotential risks both now and in the future. And we’ve added Jane Karpinski, formerly chief auditor, to the\nManagement Group as the global head of Regulatory Affairs.\nWe believe that strong communities make our company more resilient as well. Since our earliest\ndays, Northern Trust has prioritized giving back to the communities in which we live and work. That idea\nhas evolved over time, and today we help make the world around us more resilient, too, through\nvolunteerism, philanthropy, inclusion and more.\nIn 2023, Northern Trust contributed to charitable organizations that focus on basic needs proven to\nimprove long-term financial success: food, housing, education and healthcare. And our employees\nprovided over 106,000 hours of volunteer service to over 2,000 charities worldwide. The Northern Trust\nFoundation launched its first annual Northern Trust Anchor Award, a $1 million grant provided to an\ninnovative organization in our headquarter city of Chicago. This year, the funding went to food pantry\nNourishing Hope to expand its services on the underserved South and West sides of the city.\nFor the 29th year in a row, we received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating, showing our\ncommitment to building better financial futures for all.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 7\nDRIVING PRODUCTIVITY\nOngoing productivity improvements are crucial for delivering greater value to clients, maximizing\noperational efficiency and achieving long-term profitability. To enhance and accelerate these efforts,\nwe established a Productivity Office last year to create a dedicated function to partner with our\nbusinesses to drive productivity improvements across the company, ensuring permanence in both\nefficiency and effectiveness. The office provides oversight and governance, cross-functional leadership\nand collaboration, and enhanced reporting and analytics to enable Northern Trust to achieve its annual\nproductivity goals.\nThe firm realized more than $100 million in productivity savings in 2023, largely driven by workforce,\nvendor and general operating efficiency efforts. Productivity efforts touched a broad scope of\nactivities and businesses, which included a focus on process enhancements, investing in new tools,\nautomation and digital technology, organizational design and operating model review, vendor\nmanagement and real estate footprint optimization.\nGenerating efficiency and productivity across our company allows us to create capacity to invest in our\nbusinesses and talent, help offset inflationary pressures and reduce expense growth.\nINVESTING IN CAPABILITIES\nTo bring our strategic objectives to fruition, we will continue to invest in three core capabilities: talent,\ntechnology and data. It is the synergy between these three areas that drives our growth, ensures our\nresiliency and enhances our productivity.\nTALENT\nWe understand the importance of investing in our employees, as they are the linchpin of our\norganization. Our exceptional and diverse teams around the world support our client relationships,\nfuel our innovation and drive our productivity. We strive to offer competitive benefits that meet the\nphysical, mental and financial needs of our employees, while incentivizing performance and\nengagement through compensation and recognition programs. Last year, we made progress in our\ntotal rewards offerings by reimagining the future of work and institutionalizing our hybrid work model.\nFurthermore, we have reinstated cherished in-person traditions and introduced new rituals that\nbrought us together to celebrate service milestones and top performance. These initiatives demonstrate\nour commitment to creating a dynamic and engaging workplace for our employees.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 8\nTo support our employees, we are also investing in the intangible: our culture. Northern Trust’s culture\nis powerful. It defines who we are and acts as the glue that unites us across continents, businesses\nand functions. Our culture does not just describe us; it influences everything we do and is the greatest\ndeterminant of how we perform as a company. Galvanizing our more than 23,000 employees to operate\nas one requires us to preserve what is best about our culture and address the aspects that must change.\nTo that end, we have deployed refreshed cultural behaviors that are being embedded and activated\nthroughout our businesses, processes and policies.\nWe are unwavering in our commitment to our employees. We will continue to modernize ways of working,\nevolve workspaces and nurture our culture to enhance their experience.\nTECHNOLOGY\nAs the standard for technological innovation continues to rise in our industry, we are building on our\nsolid foundation by continually investing in digital and modern workplace capabilities to complement\nour human touch. Collaborating with our business partners, we aim to redefine the constructive\ncollaboration between people, processes and technology to accelerate and scale our resiliency and\nend-to-end client and employee experiences.\nIn 2023, we put to work several innovative ideas leveraging the emerging artificial intelligence tools\nthat have taken most industries by storm. These are early-stage activities, but the learning from\nthis work, as well as the eventual benefits from implementation, ensure we are prepared to leverage\nthis exciting new technology as it matures. We have used leading third-party partners and our existing\nsecurity and risk management practices to ensure a safe learning and development environment\nfor these new capabilities.\nNORTHERN TRUST’S CULTURE IS\nPOWERFUL. IT DEFINES WHO WE\nARE AND ACTS AS THE GLUE THAT\nUNITES US ACROSS CONTINENTS,\nBUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS.\n22002233 AANNNNUUAALL RREEPPOORRTT || MMEESSSSAAGGEE TTOO SSHHAARREEHHOOLLDDEERRSS 99\nWe aim to leverage technology to not only improve operational efficiency but also to elevate market\ncompetitiveness, user satisfaction and productivity. Our focus on innovation and adaptation to evolving\nthreats will enable us to stay ahead in the ever-changing landscape of technology.\nBest Digital Innovator\n– THE WEALTH TECH AWARDS, FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP\nDATA\nData drives everything we do. We have long recognized the importance of being intentional about\nhow we collect, store, access and protect data. This commitment ensures that our employees have the\ninformation they need to deliver their best, while providing our clients with a seamless and personalized\nexperience. To achieve this, we have embarked on a data modernization journey, leveraging leading\npractices through a data mesh approach.\nOne area where we have seen considerable progress is in our Asset Servicing business. Through our\nproprietary Matrix Data Platform, we are driving scalable growth and revolutionizing our approach to\ndata management. By pairing our enterprise data mesh with other cutting-edge technologies, we have\ncreated a new digital backbone and open architecture for all our asset servicing solutions globally.\nThe Matrix Data Platform has simplified internal processes and optimized the quality and speed of data\nprocessing. This has allowed us to accelerate our automation efforts, resulting in improved service\nquality and scalability.\nIn addition, we are democratizing data for our clients and employees. By enabling more advanced\nanalytics and artificial intelligence, we empower them to make better-informed decisions. This\ndemocratization of data not only enhances the client experience but also drives innovation and growth\nwithin our organization.\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to leveraging the power of data and continuing to invest\nin innovative technologies to support our clients and drive our success.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS 10\nManagement Group photo: Back row, left to right: Daniel Gamba (President, Asset Management), Teresa Parker (President, Asset\nServicing, EMEA), Mark Gossett (Chief Risk Officer), Steve Fradkin (President, Wealth Management), Jason Tyler (Chief Financial Officer),\nJane Karpinski (Global Head of Regulatory Affairs), Peter Cherecwich (President, Asset Servicing)\nFront row, left to right: Alex Taylor (Chief Human Resources Officer), Mike O’Grady (Chairman & Chief Executive Officer), Susan Levy\n(General Counsel), Thomas South (Chief Information Officer)\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\nIn this ever-evolving landscape, we understand that challenges and opportunities go hand in hand.\nWe have seen firsthand how resilience and adaptability can turn adversity into achievement.

Wealth\nManagement services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 19 U.S. states and\nWashington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 1\nASSET MANAGEMENT\nAsset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the Asset Servicing and Wealth\nManagement reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products\nto clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and\ncollective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and\nunregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active and passive equity; active and\npassive fixed income; cash management; multi-asset and alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds\nof funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products. Asset Management’s activities also include overlay services\nand other risk management services. Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution\narrangements and its revenue and expense are fully allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. As discussed\nabove, Northern Trust managed $1.43 trillion in assets as of December 31, 2023, including $1.03 trillion for Asset\nServicing clients and $402.5 billion for Wealth Management clients.\nCompetition\nNorthern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition comes from both\nregulated and unregulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global\nmarkets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and\nservice companies, including other custodial banks, investment counseling firms, deposit-taking institutions, asset\nmanagement firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, and various\nfinancial technology companies, including software providers and data services firms. As our businesses grow and markets\nevolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.\nNorthern Trust’s business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it\nbelieves it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to\ndifferentiate itself from its competitors with premier, holistic solutions and exceptional experiences tailored to meet clients’\nneeds. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring and scalable sources of fee-based\nincome and continual productivity improvements. Northern Trust also seeks to maintain its foundational strength with a\nstrong, conservative balance sheet and a globally respected brand.\nEconomic Conditions And Government Policies\nThe earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic\nconditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their\neconomies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and\nprofitability of its loan and investment portfolios.\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through\nits open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks\nmay borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by\nthe Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and therefore what banks earn on their loans and investments and\nwhat they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds.\nSupervision and Regulation\nNorthern Trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States and in each of the\njurisdictions in which it does business. The descriptions below outline significant elements of selected laws and regulations\napplicable to Northern Trust and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory\nprovisions summarized. These descriptions do not summarize all laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust or all\npossible or proposed changes to such laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statutes or\nregulatory provisions.\nChanges in laws or regulations applicable to Northern Trust may have a material effect on its businesses and results of\noperations. The scope of the laws and regulations, and the intensity of the supervision to which Northern Trust is subject\nhave increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors,\nincluding the banking turmoil in early 2023, technological factors, market changes, and climate change concerns.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Northern Trust\nexpects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and heightened supervision.\nFINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION\nUnder U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company subject\nto the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. A financial holding company is permitted to\nengage in a broader range of financial activities than a bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to\nlimit the activities that a financial holding company may conduct if any depository institution controlled by the financial\n2 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nholding company is found to no longer be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” or has not received at least a\n“satisfactory” rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examination. Failure to meet one or more of\nthese requirements may result in restrictions on the Corporation’s ability to exercise powers granted to financial holding\ncompanies, to engage in new activities, to continue current activities, or to make acquisitions.\nSUBSIDIARY REGULATION\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC), and is subject to regulation by both agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also\nsubject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois\nDepartment of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal\nReserve Board and is registered as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the\nCommodity Exchange Act. As a result, the Bank is subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by certain other\nregulatory bodies, including the CFTC and the National Futures Association (NFA). The Corporation’s nonbanking\naffiliates are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and, in certain circumstances, other functional\nregulators, as discussed in greater detail below.\nENHANCED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS\nUnder the Federal Reserve Board’s tailoring rules, the Corporation is subject to the enhanced prudential standards\napplicable to Category II banking organizations. As a Category II institution, the Corporation must submit annual capital\nplans to the Federal Reserve Board, conduct supervisory and internal periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in\nadverse economic conditions, maintain enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management\nframework (discussed below in “Liquidity Standards”) and single counterparty credit limits, conduct liquidity stress tests,\nand hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Corporation is not\nsubject to all of the standards applicable to U.S. bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank\nholding companies (GSIBs), such as the total loss-absorbing capacity requirement, capital surcharge, enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio, or additional single counterparty credit limits.\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND CLEAN HOLDING COMPANY REQUIREMENTS\nIn the summer of 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with\n$100 billion or more in total assets to comply with long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements\nsimilar to those that currently apply only to GSIBs. This proposal would also impose a long-term debt requirement on\ncertain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs, including insured\ndepository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank. If adopted, this proposal would require\nthe Corporation and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the\ngreatest of (i) 6% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs), (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (iii) 3.5% of average total\nconsolidated assets. The Bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt to the\nCorporation, and the Corporation would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt externally. In\naddition, if adopted as proposed, the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the Corporation from\nentering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution, including, for example, prohibiting the\nCorporation from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties, as well as limiting the\namount of the Corporation’s liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. The public comment period on this proposed\nrule ran through January 16, 2024.\nRESOLUTION PLANNING\nAs required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank\nAct), the Corporation is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC a resolution plan for its\nrapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In August 2023, the Federal Reserve Board\nand FDIC proposed updated guidance on resolution planning requirements applicable to the Corporation under Section\n165(d). The Corporation’s next 2024 165(d) plan submission is due to the FDIC and Federal Reserve Board by March 31,\n2025.\nIn addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for\nresolution in the event of its failure, with the next plan being due for submission on December 1, 2024. In August 2023, the\nFDIC issued a proposed rule that would require covered insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, to submit a full\nresolution plan to the FDIC every two years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit\na full resolution plan. The proposed rule would also increase the content requirements for plan submissions and introduce a\nnew credibility standard for the FDIC’s evaluation of resolution plans, which would be enforceable against the covered\ninsured depository institutions.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 3\nSeparately, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) sets out the framework for the\nrecovery and resolution of European Union (EU) credit institutions and systemically-important investment firms, including\ncertain of the Bank’s subsidiaries and branches. The BRRD establishes a set of harmonized rules for early intervention\nmeasures, recovery and resolution planning, bail-in powers and requirements for total loss absorbing capital for EU\ninstitutions, collectively known as minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). Northern Trust\nGlobal Services SE, a Luxembourg-incorporated indirect subsidiary of the Bank, is authorized and supervised by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and subject to the prudential supervision of the ECB and the Luxembourg Commission de\nSurveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). As such, Northern Trust Global Services SE falls within the scope of the BRRD\nand its recovery and resolution planning is overseen by the CSSF and the Single Resolution Board (the resolution authority\nfor ECB-supervised institutions).\nThe United Kingdom (UK) has established a special resolution regime and a resolvability assessment framework\noverseen by the Bank of England (as the UK resolution authority) with many similar features to the BRRD, which was\nsubstantially incorporated into UK law following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. The special resolution regime\napplies to firms that are permitted to accept deposits under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As\nsuch, the London branch of the Bank, as a UK branch of a third-country institution that accepts deposits, falls within the\nscope of the special resolution regime.\nORDERLY LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered\nsubsidiaries, can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority if in default or danger of default and their resolution under\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, among other\nrequirements set by statute. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed\nas its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation. Absent such actions, the\nCorporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nTHE VOLCKER RULE.\nThe Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities, including the Bank and its affiliates, from engaging in\nproprietary trading, subject to certain exemptions and exclusions, such as for market-making, hedging, certain trading\nactivities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also\nprohibits certain investments in, and relationships with, covered funds as defined in the Volcker Rule, such as hedge funds,\nprivate equity funds and similar funds, subject to a number of exemptions and exclusions. Northern Trust maintains an\nenterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule.\nHOLDING COMPANY AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH\nThe Corporation, as a bank holding company, is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to\nits depository institution subsidiary. Under this requirement, the Corporation could be required to commit resources to the\nBank should the Bank experience financial distress.\nPAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\nThe Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with\nthe capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the Federal Reserve Board, including the stress capital buffer\nrequirement, discussed further in “—Capital Adequacy Requirements” below. Dividends from the Bank are a significant\nsource of funds for the Corporation, and the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends\nin part on the ability of the Bank to pay sufficient dividends to the Corporation.\nVarious other federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the\nCorporation without regulatory consent. The Bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized, or if the payment of\nthe dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar\nyear is limited to its “recent earnings” (the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two\npreceding years), or its “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or\ntransferred to surplus), whichever is less. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation may also be affected\nby the capital adequacy standards applicable to the Bank (discussed further below), which include minimum requirements\nand buffers.\nCAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING\nThe Corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rules, which require the\nCorporation to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board for review.\nThe major components of that oversight are the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run\n4 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\ntesting of capital under various scenarios, including baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate\nbanking regulator.\nUnder the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal\nReserve Board annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to\ncombine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). Results from the\nCorporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly\navailable. Northern Trust published the results of its most recent company-run stress tests on June 28, 2023.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Corporation, as a bank holding company, is subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines implemented by\nthe Federal Reserve Board that are based on industry-standard guidelines published by the International Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), known as Basel III. The Bank, as an FDIC-insured depository institution, is\nalso required to meet risk-based and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to\nthose established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies.\nUnder the Basel III rules, the Corporation, with the Bank, is a “core” banking organization that is required to use the\nadvanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly its risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation also is\nsubject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios. The\nCorporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced\napproaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy.\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III endgame agreement for\nlarge banks (Basel III Endgame Proposal). The proposal would introduce a new measure of RWAs known as “Expanded\nTotal RWAs” (the expanded risk-based approach), reflecting new RWA methodologies that generally align with changes to\nthe global Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee. The proposal would eliminate the current Basel III rule’s\nadvanced approaches methodologies and effectively replace it with the expanded risk-based approach, which more heavily\nrelies on standardized methodologies. As compared with the standardized approach, the expanded risk-based approach\nincludes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework. In addition, unlike the\nstandardized approach, the expanded risk-based approach includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment RWA\ncomponents.\nThe Basel III Endgame Proposal, if adopted as a final rule, would maintain the current Basel III rule’s dual-\nrequirement structure, whereby the Corporation and the Bank would be required to calculate risk-based capital ratios under\nboth the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. In addition, the proposal would modify the\nstandardized approach by requiring that the new market risk standards from the proposal also be applied in the standardized\napproach.\nThe Basel III Endgame Proposal would apply the stress capital buffer to risk-based capital requirements calculated\nunder both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal includes a proposed effective\ndate of July 1, 2025, with three-year transition arrangements until revised standards are fully phased in on July 1, 2028.\nBased on our current understanding of the proposed rule, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had\napplied on a fully phased-in basis as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact,\nour expanded risk-based approach RWAs as of that date would have been approximately 5% to 15% higher than our actual\nstandardized approach RWAs as of that date. The proposed rule would phase in the higher expanded risk-based approach\nRWAs on July 1 of each year during the transition, thereby increasing our regulatory capital requirements, with delayed\nincorporation of the potentially lower stress capital buffer calculations.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 5\nThe Bank’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios at December 31, 2023, were well above the regulatory requirements\nestablished by U.S. banking regulators. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank,\ntogether with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in\nthe following chart.\nTABLE 1: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\nCOMMON EQUITY SUPPLEMENTARY\nTIER 1 CAPITAL TIER 1 CAPITAL TOTAL CAPITAL TIER 1 LEVERAGE LEVERAGE\nSTANDARDIZED ADVANCED STANDARDIZED ADVANCED STANDARDIZED ADVANCED STANDARDIZED ADVANCED ADVANCED\nAPPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH\nNorthern Trust\nCorporation 11.4 % 13.4 % 12.3 % 14.5 % 14.2 % 16.5 % 8.1 % 8.1 % 8.6 %\nThe Northern Trust\nCompany 12.2 % 14.6 % 12.2 % 14.6 % 13.8 % 16.3 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.5 %\nMinimum required\nratio 4.5 % 4.5 % 6.0 % 6.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 3.0 %\n“Well-capitalized”\nminimum ratios, as\napplicable\nNorthern Trust\nCorporation N/A N/A 6.0 % 6.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % N/A N/A N/A\nThe Northern\nTrust Company 6.5 % 6.5 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 3.0 %\nAdvanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, are subject to a minimum supplementary\nleverage ratio of 3.0%. Advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, also\nmust maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well-capitalized.” The Corporation is also\nsubject to a stress capital buffer, which integrates forward-looking stress test results with non-stress capital requirements,\nand the Bank is also subject to a capital conservation buffer, which respectively requires the Corporation and the Bank to\nhold a buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid\nconstraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation. The minimum capital buffer requirement for advanced\napproaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank, is 2.5%.\nA “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization’s total RWA for advanced approaches banking\norganizations, such as the Corporation, is also a component of the capital adequacy framework. In general, the amount of\nthe countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various\njurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. The U.S. countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0%.\nThe results of the 2023 DFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 28, 2023, resulted in Northern\nTrust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at\n2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the 2023 capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2023.\nLIQUIDITY STANDARDS\nNorthern Trust is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement, which is designed to ensure that\ncovered banking organizations, including the Corporation and the Bank, maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high-\nquality liquid assets equal to their expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under a prescribed regulatory\nliquidity stress scenario. As of December 31, 2023, the Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with applicable LCR\nrequirements.\nNorthern Trust also is subject to the U.S. net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement, designed to promote more\nmedium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with applicable NSFR requirements. In addition, in\n2023, Northern Trust began publicly disclosing certain qualitative and quantitative information about its NSFR consistent\nwith the semi-annual disclosure requirements of the Federal Reserve Board’s final rule on U.S. NSFR disclosure.\nAs noted above, the enhanced prudential standards impose additional liquidity requirements for large bank holding\ncompanies. The Corporation, a Category II institution under the final tailoring rule, is subject to the liquidity risk\nmanagement, monthly liquidity stress testing, liquidity buffer, and daily liquidity reporting requirements.\n6 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nPROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION\nFederal banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if\nthat institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, and are also authorized to take appropriate action against a\nparent bank holding company of an under-capitalized banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation could be\nrequired to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan for the Bank if it were under-capitalized.\nRESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES\nThe Bank is subject to restrictions governing transactions between it and affiliated entities, including the Corporation,\nits affiliates, and its subsidiaries. These transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be,\noffered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., on terms not less favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of\ncredit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for\ntransactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with all affiliates.\nSWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES.\nNorthern Trust is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose\nmargin requirements, business conduct requirements, trade reporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated\nexchanges or execution facilities for certain types of swaps and security-based swaps. CFTC and U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) rules require registration of swap dealers and security-based swap dealers, respectively, and\nimpose numerous obligations on such registrants, including adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope\ninstruments. The Bank is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and is subject to CFTC and NFA rules and supervision\nrelated to its swaps business. Swap dealers regulated by a prudential regulator, like the Bank, are subject to uncleared swap\nmargin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the prudential regulators. The Corporation has not\nregistered and does not expect that it, or any of its affiliates, will be required to register as a security-based swap dealer\nwith the SEC.\nIn addition, certain nonbanking affiliates, including Northern Trust Securities, Inc. and Northern Trust Investments,\nInc., are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under\ncertain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance, and commodity pool operators have\ncertain responsibilities with respect to each pool they operate or advise.\nBROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REGULATION\nNorthern Trust Securities, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of various self-regulatory\norganizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Broker-dealers are subject to laws and\nregulations relating to all aspects of their securities business operations, including, but not limited to, sales and trading\npractices, securities offerings, handling of customer funds, net capital levels, recordkeeping, privacy requirements, and the\nconduct of directors, officers, and employees. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states\nwhere they do business. Northern Trust Securities, Inc. is also registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\n(MSRB) as a municipal securities dealer and subject to regulation as such.\nNorthern Trust Securities, Inc. and other subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC as investment\nadvisers and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Corporation’s registered investment advisers in the United States are\nsubject to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Advisers Act), and SEC rules and regulations\nthereunder, including with respect to record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations,\nfiduciary and other obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, and other applicable state and federal laws and\nregulations, including anti-fraud laws. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations\nof the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.\nNoncompliance with the Investment Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in\ninvestigations, sanctions, disgorgement, termination of an investment adviser’s registration, fines and/or reputational harm.\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL\nCertain subsidiaries of the Corporation are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA\nPATRIOT Act of 2001 and implemented in the regulation of the federal banking regulators and the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (FinCEN), which requires banks to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and financial\ntransparency requirements, such as conducting due diligence, verifying client and beneficial owner identification, and\nmonitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the United States\ncontain similar requirements.\nIn September 2022, FinCEN issued a final rule implementing one of three rulemakings planned in connection with the\nCorporate Transparency Act, which imposes new beneficial ownership information reporting requirements (Beneficial\nOwnership Reporting Rule). In order to comply with the Beneficial Ownership Reporting Rule, both domestic reporting\ncompanies and foreign reporting companies registered to do business in the United States generally will be required to\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 7\nreport information regarding themselves, their beneficial owners, and their company applicants. The Beneficial Ownership\nReporting Rule became effective January 1, 2024 and may affect certain companies that the Corporation invests in,\nmanages, or does business with. Additionally, on December 16, 2022, FinCEN published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\nfor its second set of rulemakings in connection with the Corporate Transparency Act, which addresses how authorized\nrecipients can access beneficial ownership information that will be reported to FinCEN and may affect certain activities\nconducted by the Bank. FinCEN issued the final rule on December 21, 2023, and it became effective on February 20, 2024.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces U.S.\neconomic sanctions laws and regulations, which prohibit the Corporation and its subsidiaries from engaging in business in\nor with certain jurisdictions and parties that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions, such as organizations and countries\nsuspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts or undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\ndemocratic countries. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction, asset or\naccount, the Corporation or the Bank must reject or block such account or transaction and notify the appropriate authorities.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties\nin obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to reputation. Many other countries have imposed\nsimilar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and\nprocedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations.\nDEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS\nThe Bank accepts deposits and eligible deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum\ndeposit insurance amount, which is currently $250,000 for each ownership right and capacity under which the eligible\ndeposit accounts are maintained. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), insurance of deposits may be\nterminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices,\nis in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated laws, regulations, or orders from a regulatory agency.\nThe FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is funded by assessments on FDIC-insured depository institutions. The\nFDIC assesses premiums based on an assessment rate and an assessment base. An insured depository institution’s\nassessment base considers average consolidated total assets, less the average tangible equity of the insured depository\ninstitution during the assessment period. The assessment base of custody banks is adjusted to exclude certain liquid assets\nfrom total average assets. To qualify as a custody bank, certain institutional eligibility criteria must be met. The Bank\nqualifies as a custody bank for this purpose. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based system to determine each institution’s\nassessment rate. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain\nlimits.\nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet\nor exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. Based on the FDIC’s recent projections, the FDIC\ndetermined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of\nSeptember 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates. In 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule,\napplicable to insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly\nby 2 basis points, beginning on January 1, 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the long-term target reserve ratio\nfor the DIF, referred to as the Designated Reserve Ratio, at 2% for 2023. The increase in assessment rate schedules is\nintended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% by the\nstatutory deadline of September 30, 2028.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF\nassociated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is\nequal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured domestic office deposits reported as of December 31, 2022,\nadjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured domestic office deposits. The final rule provides that the FDIC will\ncollect the special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, subject to\nchange depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers, failures, or amendments to reported estimates of\nuninsured deposits. In conjunction with the special assessment, $84.6 million was recognized as an accrued liability and\nrelated expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The final rule becomes effective on April 1, 2024, and the first collection,\nincluding any adjustments as described above, will be reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of\n2024, with the first payment due on June 28, 2024. For more information on the FDIC’s special assessment, please see the\n“Consolidated Results of Operations—Noninterest Expense” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nCOMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT\nThe Bank is subject to the CRA. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to\nhelp meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons,\nconsistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. For purposes of the CRA, the Bank operates under a\n“wholesale” designation granted by the Federal Reserve Board and fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified\n8 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\ninvestments for the purposes of community development. The Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating from the\nFederal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination.\nIn October 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The\nrule materially revises the current CRA framework, mostly for retail designated banks, including the assessment areas in\nwhich a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking, the tests used to evaluate a bank\nin its assessment areas, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment and service activities, and additional data\ncollection and reporting requirements. The rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large\nbanks to receive “outstanding” ratings in the future.\nAccording to the new rule, banks currently designated as “wholesale” will be absorbed into the “limited purpose”\ndesignation. The rule outlines that a limited purpose bank is one that is not in the business of extending consumer or retail\nloans, except on an incidental and accommodation basis. Limited purpose banks are only subject to a qualitative and\nquantitative review of a bank’s community development lending and investments in each assessment area. While we will\ncontinue to be evaluated on our community development activities in our local markets, we will also be evaluated against a\nnational benchmark based on assets.\nThe rule is expected to take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of its provisions becoming applicable on January 1,\n2026. Reporting of the collected data will not be required until 2027.\nDATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY\nFederal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring\nfinancial institutions to adopt, disclose, and enforce privacy policies with respect to consumer information, setting\nlimitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information, setting standards for protecting client information and\npreventing unlawful access to such information, and requiring notice of data breaches in certain circumstances. For\nexample, the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security, and the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act regulates the confidentiality and security of customer information obtained by financial institutions and\ncertain other types of financial services businesses.\nMost U.S. states, the EU and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations\nconcerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches―for example, the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR) in Europe and its equivalent in the UK (UK GDPR), the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL)\nin China, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, CCPA)\nin the United States. Similar laws are in effect or being considered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the\nglobe. The GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy and security laws across the European Economic Area (EEA), to\nprotect EEA citizens’ data privacy and security. The GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements on both data\ncontrollers and data processors and has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors\noutside the EEA whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of,\nEEA individuals. Organizations that violate certain provisions of the GDPR could be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their\nannual worldwide revenue for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater. The GDPR also has been implemented into\nUK law as part of the arrangements following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and operates in conjunction with other\nlocal data privacy requirements, although the GDPR and UK GDPR may diverge over time. The UK is also in the process\nof reforming its data privacy rules through a new Data Protection and Digital Information Bill.\nIn the United States, the CCPA broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of\nCalifornia residents to understand how their personal information is collected, used, and otherwise processed by\ncommercial businesses, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out\nof certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA includes a private right of action (permitting lawsuits to be\nbrought by private individuals instead of the state Attorney General or other government actor for certain breaches), and\ncontemplates civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for each intentional violation.\nIn addition, several states have enacted comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the CCPA. These will apply in\naddition to laws that already exist in all 50 U.S. states that require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances\nto consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has\nrecently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security\nlegislation, to which we may be subject if enacted.\nThe Corporation maintains a regulatory change framework to monitor and respond to regulatory change, including for\ndata privacy, and has adopted and disseminated privacy policies and communicates required information relating to\nfinancial privacy and data security in accordance with applicable law.\nCONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nThe Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect\nconsumers in transactions with banks. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties,\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 9\noperating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. Consumer laws and regulations are enforced by\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other federal and state regulators.\nNON-U.S. REGULATION\nNorthern Trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the UK\nare authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the Prudential\nRegulation Authority (PRA) and/or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory\nand disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated\nbusiness upon breach of the relevant regulations, impose capital requirements, suspend registered employees, and impose\ncensures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. Additionally, the Bank is licensed as a\nforeign authorized deposit-taking institution in Australia under the Banking Act (Australia) and as a wholesale bank in\nSingapore under the Banking Act (Singapore) and as a result is subject to the supervision of the Australian Prudential\nRegulation Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, respectively.\nNorthern Trust’s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the EU and\nthe member states in which they are domiciled. For example, Northern Trust Global Services SE, as an EU-domiciled\ncredit institution in Luxembourg, is subject to the prudential supervision of the ECB and the CSSF. Moreover, Northern\nTrust’s non-EU branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities in the EU may fall within the scope of the\nlaws of the EU and, given the increasing extraterritorial effect of EU legislation, non-EU branches and subsidiaries may\nstill fall within the scope of EU law if they transact outside of the EU with EU clients.\nSince January 31, 2020, the UK has not been a member of the EU. EU legislation as it applied to the UK on December\n31, 2020 is a part of UK domestic legislation, under the control of the UK’s parliament. Most UK law relevant to the\nCorporation and its subsidiaries is still closely aligned with the EU legislative framework in place in December 2020.\nHowever, in 2022, the UK government proposed legislation that makes significant reforms to the UK’s financial services\nregulations. In particular, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 includes measures revoking retained EU law\nrelating to financial services. In addition, the UK government announced a package of post-Brexit reforms to drive growth\nand competitiveness in the financial services sector. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 along with these other\nreforms may directly and indirectly impact the Corporation.\nThe following items provide a brief description of certain key regulatory requirements in the EU and the UK relevant\nto the Corporation and its subsidiaries, in addition to the BRRD and GDPR discussed under “Resolution Planning” and\n“Data Privacy and Security,” respectively, above.\nEU and UK Prudential Regulatory Frameworks. The EU Capital Requirements Directive of June 26, 2013 (CRD)\nand the EU Capital Requirements Regulation of June 26, 2013 (CRR) set out the framework for prudential regulation of\ncredit institutions in the EU, including, among other things, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage, and disclosure and\nreporting. CRR and CRD have been subject to extensive amendments relating to the leverage ratio, the net stable funding\nratio, large exposures, and market and counterparty credit risk, enhancing the resiliency of EU banks to potential future\neconomic shocks, the transition to climate neutrality and finalizing the implementation of the Basel III agreement. Since\nJune 26, 2021, investment firms under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID) have been subject to a new\nprudential regime under the EU Investment Firm Directive and Investment Firm Regulation. In April 2021, the Financial\nServices Act came into force in the UK establishing among other things, (i) a framework for the new investment firm\nprudential framework to apply in the UK and (ii) the UK implementation of Basel III standards, including amendments to\nCRR as implemented into UK law following the withdrawal from the EU. UK and EU branches and subsidiaries of the\nCorporation may also be subject to local rules on outsourcing and operational resilience.\nMarkets Regulation. MIFID (which came into force in 2018), the linked Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation\n(MIFIR), and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation 648/2012 (EMIR) are the primary pieces of EU legislation\nwhich regulate, among other things, trading in derivative and securities markets, transaction reporting, investor protection,\nclearing and risk mitigation. MIFID, MIFIR and EMIR, with applicable amendments, now form part of UK law under the\nlegislation implemented when the UK left the EU. Reforms to the onshored version of MIFIR have been made by the UK\nFinancial Services and Markets Act 2023. The reforms impact, among other things, the share trading obligation and\nderivatives trading obligation.\nCentral Securities Depositories Regulation. On September 17, 2014, the EU Central Securities Depositories\nRegulation (CSDR) entered into force (subject to a number of transitional provisions). The CSDR aims principally to\nensure that transactions between buyers and sellers of dematerialized securities are settled in a safe and timely manner by\nintroducing common securities settlement standards across the EU. Key features of the CSDR include shorter settlement\nperiods, settlement discipline measures (including mandatory cash penalties and “buy-ins” for settlement fails and\nsettlement fails reporting) and an obligation regarding dematerialization for most securities. In the UK, the Financial\n10 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nServices and Markets Act 2023 grants to the Bank of England new rule-making powers in relation to central securities\ndepositories (CSD).\nSecurities Financing Transactions and Reuse of Collateral Regulation. On November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a\nregulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral (SFTR) as part of its approach to addressing shadow\nbanking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions.\nThe SFTR entered into force on January 12, 2016. The reporting obligations under the SFTR were phased in over several\nperiods through January 11, 2021.\nBenchmarks Regulation. On January 1, 2018, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) became applicable in all EU\nmember states. The principal objectives of the BMR are to restore investor confidence in the accuracy, robustness and\nintegrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of\ninvestment funds, and the benchmark-setting process itself. The BMR aims to achieve these objectives by ensuring that\nbenchmarks are not subject to conflicts of interest, are used appropriately, and reflect the actual market or economic reality\nthey are intended to measure. The BMR has been incorporated into UK law following the withdrawal from the EU, with\napplicable amendments. In the UK, the FCA has exercised powers under the BMR to effect the publication of a synthetic\nLIBOR rate for one-month, three-month and six-month sterling and U.S. Dollar LIBOR (USD LIBOR) beyond their\nrespective dates of cessation.\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations. On December 29, 2019, the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure\nRegulations (SFDR) entered into force. SFDR aims to prevent “greenwashing” (conveying a misleading or false\nimpression a product is more environmentally favorable than it actually is) by requiring disclosure of how sustainability\nrisks and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are part of the investment and business processes of asset\nmanagers. Mandatory disclosures are required to be published at product and manager levels in a variety of ways, including\non websites, in pre-contractual documents (e.g., prospectuses) and in annual reports. In October 2021, the UK government\nannounced that it will launch its own consultation with stakeholders on sustainable finance disclosures rules for certain UK\nmarket participants and certain investment products. On October 25, 2022, the FCA issued a consultation paper on new\nmeasures for a UK regime on sustainability disclosure requirements and investment labels. The new measures will enter\ninto force during the course of 2024.\nTaxonomy Regulation. On July 12, 2020, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulations) entered into force. The\nTaxonomy Regulations are part of the EU’s recent measures designed to encourage environmentally sustainable investment\ndecision making and introduce a technical framework to ascertain how sustainable an economic activity is. The Taxonomy\nRegulations apply to financial market participants including MiFID firms, Undertakings for the Collective Investment in\nTransferable Securities (UCITS) management companies, and alternative investment fund managers, and will require them\nto make further entity, pre-contractual and periodic disclosures. The UK government is in the process of implementing its\nown “green” taxonomy for guiding companies and investors on “green” investments, similar to the EU regime.\nDeposit Guarantee Scheme. Eligible deposits held with EU credit institutions and certain other financial entities are\nsubject to the recast Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) implemented in 2014. It required EU member states to\nintroduce legislation establishing at least one deposit guarantee scheme (DGS). A DGS which is established and recognized\nin one member state is obliged to cover the depositors (up to certain prescribed amounts) at branches of the same institution\nin other EU member states. In the UK, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme is the national DGS for the protection\nand reimbursement of depositors of failed financial institutions.\nFifth EU Money Laundering Directive. On July 9, 2018, the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD5) entered\ninto force. MLD5 was required to be transposed into local law by EU member states by January 10, 2020 and introduced\nthe following key changes to the previous EU AML regime: (i) EU member states must ensure that registers of ultimate\nbeneficial owners of companies and other legal entities are accessible to the general public; (ii) the previous AML regime\nwas extended to additional service providers, such as electronic wallet providers, virtual currency exchange service\nproviders, and art dealers, and further specifications regarding the scope of application of MLD5 with respect to tax\nadvisors and estate agents were provided; (iii) the threshold for identifying holders of prepaid cards was lowered to €150;\nand (iv) EU member states were required to implement enhanced due diligence measures to monitor suspicious transactions\ninvolving high-risk countries more strictly. The UK government transposed MLD5 into UK law and, therefore, the UK\nanti-money laundering regime is currently broadly aligned with the EU. On December 7, 2022, the Council of the EU\nagreed its position on AML regulation through the Sixth EU Money Laundering Directive. The new rules will extend to,\namong other items, the entire crypto-asset sector, third-party intermediaries, persons trading in precious metals, precious\nstones and cultural goods.\nShareholder Rights Directive. On May 17, 2017, the recast Shareholder Rights Directive (EU) 2017/828 was\npublished (SRD II). Member states of the EU were required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative\nprovisions necessary to comply with the Directive by June 10, 2019. SRD was designed to establish requirements in\nrelation to the exercise of shareholder rights and, recognizing that shares are often held through complex chains of\nintermediaries, SRD II is designed to improve mechanisms for the identification of shareholders by companies, as well as\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 11\nimprove the transmission of information along the chain of intermediaries to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights.\nNon-EU intermediaries are required to comply with the requirements if they provide services with respect to shares of\ncompanies that have their registered office in the EU. SRD II has been incorporated into UK law and remains largely\naligned with the EU.\nDepositary Books & Records. Following the European Securities and Markets Authority’s opinion on asset\nsegregation and application of depositary delegation rules to CSDs published on July 20, 2017, changes were introduced by\ntwo EU regulations modifying the existing Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and UCITS Level 2\nRegulations. The changes aim to better define asset segregation requirements and to add additional safeguards, primarily\nfocusing on information flow between the depositary and any third party to whom safe-keeping functions have been\ndelegated. The key changes (i) impact the frequency of reconciliations between the depositary’s internal accounts and\nrecords and those of any third party in the custody chain, (ii) require the depositary to maintain an independent record\nseparate from the record maintained by the third party, and (iii) increase due diligence obligations where custody of assets\nis delegated to third parties outside of the EU. AIFMD and the UCITS directive were incorporated into UK law and remain\nlargely aligned with the EU. The changes impact Northern Trust’s subsidiaries providing depositary services to European-\ndomiciled fund clients.\nIn addition to the above, the Bank’s and the Corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to\nregulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2023, each of our non-U.S.\nbanking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.\nHuman Capital Management\nThe success of our company relies heavily on the strength of the people we employ. Attracting, engaging, developing and\nretaining Northern Trust talent is critical. We invest in our employees holistically to continually build a diverse pipeline of\nfuture leaders and enable internal professional advancement. The overview below outlines Northern Trust’s human capital\nobjectives—talent management, total rewards, and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nEMPLOYEES\nNorthern Trust employed approximately 23,100 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2023. The regional\nbreakout of our employee base is 42% Asia-Pacific, 41% North America, and 17% Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\nTALENT MANAGEMENT\nWe pride ourselves in attracting strong talent and have identified the development of our talent as a strategic priority.\nOur focus on well-being, diversity, and a culture of trust, care and collaboration contribute to our employer brand.\nSourcing and Recruitment. We target our talent identification, sourcing methods, and recruitment strategies to specific\nlocations using various channels such as job boards, colleges, professional networks, associations and online social\nnetworks. We base hiring decisions on a variety of factors including relevant experience and accomplishments, educational\nbackground, professional licensing, and strong evidence of integrity and ethical behavior.\nOnboarding. Northern Trust is committed to helping all new hires succeed from day one. New employees begin their\nonboarding journey with a comprehensive learning roadmap that orients them to our history, brand, businesses, and\nculture. Orientation programs also augment the onboarding experience by providing global, regional, and/or local\ninformation along with networking activities to help connect new hires to each other and other colleagues.\nLearning and Development. An integrated partnership between our enterprise-wide and functional learning and\ndevelopment teams ensures we deliver holistic training solutions. Through our online learning portal, Northern Trust\nUniversity, all employees can access a portfolio of professional and functional training offerings most helpful to their role.\nWe provide targeted development opportunities for employees transitioning into management and throughout their\nmanagement and leadership career. Our training content is dynamic as we regularly evaluate its quality and utilization and\nwe refresh and organize courses and resources to enable employees to develop skills most critical to servicing our clients\nand developing their careers. A continuing area of focus is helping expand digital, analytical and financial acumen and\nskills across the enterprise. Many of our programs are interactive, include peer networking, and offer direct access to expert\nfacilitators. Training is offered through online libraries of self-study content and in both virtual and classroom instructor-led\nformats.\nTalent Planning and Organizational Effectiveness. Northern Trust is committed to identifying and developing talent\nwith the breadth, depth, and diversity of technical and leadership skills to execute business strategies today and in the\nfuture. Managers conduct talent assessments for employees annually and business and regional leadership teams hold\nregular talent review discussions focused on specific topics, such as workforce needs, retention risks, diversity, top talent,\nreadiness for promotion, readiness-to-move, and succession plans. Senior level talent reviews are also conducted each year\nby our senior management and Board of Directors, led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human\nResources Officer.\n12 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nPerformance Management. Northern Trust’s annual performance management process includes goal setting, mid-year\ncheck-ins, multi-rater feedback, and year-end reviews. Strategic corporate priorities are set by our Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer and are applied to each business, department, team and individual. Managers are encouraged to provide\nregular feedback and real-time coaching to drive performance outcomes and facilitate development.\nEngagement and Recognition. Building an inclusive, connected and engaged employee culture is essential to\nretaining our talent. We collect employee perspectives and ideas through an annual Engagement Survey. Results are\nevaluated to identify strengths, progress, and opportunities to strengthen employee engagement, and are shared with\nemployees and the Board of Directors. We also offer an online employee recognition platform that strengthens the unity\nthat binds us as a company and connects employees in new and meaningful ways.\nTOTAL REWARDS\nOur compensation and benefit programs are designed to be market-competitive and enable us to attract and retain\ntalent to deliver on Northern Trust’s strategy.\nCompensation Programs. Our compensation programs are intended to motivate our employees to deliver the highest-\nquality service to our clients and achieve the greatest collective business results while appropriately managing risk. They\nare designed, implemented, and communicated to promote behaviors that are consistent with Northern Trust’s desired\nculture, character and enduring values of service, expertise, and integrity. We also regularly review our compensation\nprocesses and programs and take appropriate measures to ensure we can attract and retain talent in relevant markets.\nNorthern Trust’s base salary programs provide a competitive level of fixed pay reflecting each employee’s position,\nexperience, qualifications and tenure. Additionally, all employees are eligible for incentive compensation to reward\nperformance that delivers strong team or individual results. Incentive compensation is linked to both financial and non-\nfinancial performance criteria, including risk considerations, as determined by our Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement. Select senior leaders and individual contributors may receive a percentage of their incentive in Northern\nTrust stock to encourage retention of key talent and to align rewards with company performance.\nEmployee Benefits. While the exact composition of the employee benefit package varies by country, our benefit\nprograms are designed to be locally competitive, to meet the needs of our employees and their families, and to reflect the\ncultural values of the organization. Typical benefit programs include retirement, health care, paid time off, income\nprotection such as disability and life insurance, leaves of absence, and access to our Employee Assistance Program. Our\nexpanded employee well-being programs and resources focus on how to manage stress, build resiliency, and be attuned to\nmental health issues; accessing flexible or voluntary benefits; and enhancements to various parental leave offerings.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION (DE&I)\nNorthern Trust is committed to an inclusive culture and strives to create a work environment in which all individuals\nare welcomed, respected, supported, valued, and can fully contribute to the success of the business.\nLeading From the Top. Our vision for creating an inclusive environment is embedded at all levels of the organization.\nOur Board of Directors, through its Human Capital and Compensation Committee, and our Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer actively engage in oversight of our DE&I strategies and initiatives. All DE&I functions are led by our Head of\nCorporate Sustainability, Inclusion and Social Impact, who is an Executive Vice President, and reports directly to our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer. Reflecting the importance of an inclusive workplace, in 2023, we established the\nrole of Global Chief DE&I Officer, responsible for developing the enterprise’s inclusion strategies. Three Regional DE&I\nLeads are responsible for the design and execution of topic relevant programs across North America, Europe, the Middle\nEast, and the Asia-Pacific region. Our Global DE&I Executive Council is responsible for providing strategic oversight and\ndriving accountability on the inclusion priorities.\nThe following table presents the gender and ethnic diversity of our Board of Directors and executive officers.\nTABLE 2: BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REPRESENTATION\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFEMALE MALE WHITE BLACK HISPANIC ASIAN\nBoard of Directors\n25% 75% 59% 25% 8% 8%\nExecutive Officers\n33% 67% 84% 8% 8% —%\nBolstering Inclusion.

We strive\nto ensure that our policies, processes, and structures promote inclusivity and offer equitable opportunities for our\nemployees to grow and thrive within the workplace. We invest in ongoing education to increase awareness and\nunderstanding of diversity and inclusion concepts and behaviors.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 13\nLeveraging our employee Engagement Survey and insights and benchmarks from industry experts, we launched our\nInclusion Index to better understand the factors that drive inclusion and our employees’ sense of belonging across the\norganization. The Index helps us identify gaps and opportunities to build upon our strengths around inclusion. Our leaders\nare committed to implementing solutions to foster an inclusive and diverse workplace that aligns with the Corporation’s\nmission, values, goals, and business practices.\nAvailable Information\nThrough the Corporation’s website at www.northerntrust.com, the Corporation makes available free of charge its Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all other reports and all\namendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after it files such material with, or furnishes such material\nto, the SEC. The contents of the Corporation’s website, the website of the SEC or any other website referenced herein are\nnot a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. The following discussion sets forth the\nrisk factors that we have identified as being most significant to Northern Trust. Although we discuss these risk factors\nprimarily in the context of their potential effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, you should\nunderstand that these effects can have further negative implications such as: reducing the price of our common stock and\nother securities; reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that\nclients, counterparties and/or applicable regulators have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and\ngrow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers, which\nmay affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so.\nAdditional risks beyond those discussed below, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other of our reports\nfiled with, or furnished to, the SEC also could affect us adversely. Further, we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein\nor elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face and you should not interpret discussion of any\nrisk to imply that such risk has not already materialized.\nThese risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described\nin forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under\n“Forward-Looking Statements” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations.”\n14 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nSummary\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected

affected by the effects of climate change or\nconcerns related thereto.\nOther Risks\n• The systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks, as well as for other business purposes,\nare inherently limited, may not be effective in all cases and, in any case, cannot eliminate all risks that we face.\n• Changes in tax laws and interpretations and challenges to our tax positions may affect our earnings negatively.\n• Changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n• Our ability

to pay full and\ntimely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.\n16 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMarket Risks\nWe are dependent on fee-based business for a majority of our revenues, which may be affected adversely by market\nvolatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.\nOur principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn\nmost of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services. Fees for many of our\nproducts and services are based on the market value of assets under management, custody or administration; the volume of\ntransactions processed; securities lending volume and spreads; fees for other services rendered; and in certain businesses,\nfees calculated as a percentage of our clients’ earnings, all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility, a\ndownturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences. For example,\ndownturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debt-related investments resulting from market disruption,\nilliquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which\ngenerally impacted our earnings negatively. Further, although we do not hold, invest in, or custody cryptocurrency assets,\nthe markets in which they trade are highly volatile and volatility in these markets may impact the markets for other assets\nthat we hold, invest in, or custody, which could also impact our fees or financial condition. Market volatility and/or weak\neconomic conditions also may affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which\nimpact demand for certain products and services that we provide.\nOur earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors\nbeyond market volatility or weak economic conditions. Poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client\naccounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide may result in declines in the market values of\nportfolios that we manage and/or administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or\nadditional assets from existing clients. For example, from time to time in the past, outflows from certain of our products\ndriven by relative investment performance or other factors adversely impacted our overall fees derived from assets that we\nmanage. Broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds,\nsuch as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products, could also impact our earnings negatively.\nChanges in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively.\nThe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Interest rate changes could affect the interest\nearned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve Board\nincreased interest rates from historically low levels during 2022 and 2023. While a rising interest rate environment\ngenerally has a positive effect on our net interest margin, in some circumstances, a rise in interest rates also may affect us\nnegatively. For example, the rapid increases in interest rates during 2022 and 2023 adversely impacted the value of certain\nof our investment securities, with resultant impacts on our capital, liquidity, and earnings. Additionally, higher interest\nrates historically have caused, and may in the future cause: market volatility and downturns in equity markets, resulting in a\ndecrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impact our earnings negatively;\nour clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return, resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher\nfund or account redemptions; our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments, resulting in\nincreased credit costs, provisions for loan and lease losses and charge-offs; reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity,\nresulting in lower performance, yields and fees; or higher funding costs.\nConversely, low-interest-rate environments generally result in a compressed net interest margin and also have a\nnegative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products. For example, in the past we waived certain fees associated\nwith money market funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. Low net interest margins and fee waivers each\nnegatively impact our earnings.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks, if our\nassumptions about any number of variables are incorrect, these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective,\nwhich could impact earnings negatively.\nPlease see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks\nwe face.\nChanges in the monetary, trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities, central banks, governments and\ninternational agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively.\nThe monetary, trade and other policies of U.S. and international governments, agencies and regulatory bodies have a\nsignificant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance. For example, the Federal Reserve\nBoard regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. through quantitative tightening and/or easing, and its policies\ndetermine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing, and play a role in\ncontributing to or moderating levels of inflation, all of which meaningfully impact our earnings. Further, their policies can\naffect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available, which may increase the risk\nthat borrowers fail to repay their loans from us. Changes in monetary, trade and other governmental policies are beyond our\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 17\ncontrol and can be difficult to predict, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon\nour business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy, including the financial stability of various regions\nor countries across the globe, including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets,\ncould have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.\nRisks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental\nimpact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world. Foreign market and economic\ndisruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, international trade\npolicy, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt, and home prices. Additionally,\nfinancial markets may be adversely affected by the liquidity or capital deficiencies (actual or perceived) of financial\ninstitutions and related industry and government actions, current or anticipated impact of military conflict (including the\ncontinuing military conflicts involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and Israel and Hamas and other evolving events\nin the Middle East), terrorism, political or civil unrest, public health epidemics or pandemics, the exit or potential exit of\none or more countries from the EU, sovereign debt downgrades or debt crises, or other geopolitical events. For example,\ndevelopments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, including the possibility of a government shutdown, default by the\nU.S. government on its debt obligations, or related credit-rating downgrades, could have adverse effects on the broader\neconomy, disrupt access to capital markets, and contribute to, or worsen, an economic recession. The cumulative effect of\nuncertain business conditions or economic challenges faced in various foreign markets, including fiscal or monetary\nconcerns, economic downturns and the possibility of a recession in some jurisdictions, other economic factors (including\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes to tax laws or the application or enforcement\npractices of such laws), or volatility or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDeclines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.\nOur investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion, and our loan portfolio represents a smaller proportion,\nof our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions. The value of securities available for sale\nand held to maturity within our investment portfolio, which is generally determined based upon market values available\nfrom third-party sources, have fluctuated, and may continue in the future to fluctuate, as a result of market volatility and\neconomic or financial market conditions. For example, in 2023, and again in early 2024, we realized notable losses on the\nsale of available for sale securities and we may realize additional losses in the future. Declines in the value of securities\nheld in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital, liquidity, and, to the extent we realize losses,\nearnings. Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks,\nincluding hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the\nexistence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Accordingly, market risks have, from time to\ntime, negatively affected the value of securities held in our investment portfolio and in the future we could suffer additional\nadverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.\nVolatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings.\nWe provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business. Foreign\ncurrency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Foreign currency\nvolatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. Fluctuations in exchange\nrates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to\npurchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time\nperiods. We also are exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated assets and liabilities, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue\nand expense.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks, including\nhedging-related strategies. Any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively.\nPlease see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face.\nChanges in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively.\nIn past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency-trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, and the\ndemand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as\nforeign exchange trading and securities lending negatively. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these\nactivities may be affected negatively. In certain of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a\npercentage of our clients’ earnings, such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or\ntrading activities also reduce our revenues.\n18 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nOperational Risks\nMany types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.\nWe regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses. Despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational\nrisk, our risk management program may not be effective in all cases. Factors that can impact operations and expose us to\nrisks varying in size, scale and scope, some or all of which may be exacerbated by the trend toward hybrid and remote\nworking arrangements in recent years, include:\n• failures of technological systems or networks or breaches of security measures, including, but not limited to, those\nresulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other information security incidents;\n• human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;\n• theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external\nthird parties;\n• defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;\n• breakdowns in processes and internal controls; over-reliance on manual processes and controls, which are less scalable\nthan automated processes and controls;\n• failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations;\n• failure of any third-party vendor to properly execute the processes on which Northern Trust relies;\n• unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;\n• defects in product design or delivery;\n• difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable\npricing from third-party vendors;\n• negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party vendors, employees or associates in our\nday-to-day operations; and\n• external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as pandemics, geopolitical events, political or\nsocial unrest, natural disasters or acts of terrorism.\nWhile we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors, these plans\nmay not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively. We also may fail to identify or fully understand the\nimplications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as our geographic\nfootprint, product pipeline and client needs and expectations evolve—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and\nbusiness continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion. If our controls and business continuity\nplans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully, such factors may\nhave a negative impact on our business (including operational resilience), financial condition or results of operations. In\naddition, an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully\nunderstand the inherent risk in our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions. We\ncontinue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and\nappropriate for our role as a major financial institution. Nonetheless, if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that\nsensitizes all of our employees to managing risk, our business could be impacted adversely. Please see “Other Risks” in\nthis “Risk Factors” section for further description of risks associated with the systems and models we employ to analyze,\nmonitor and mitigate risks.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology systems and networks, many of which are operated by third parties,\nand any failures of, or disruptions to, our or such third parties’ technological systems or networks could materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent on our and third parties’ information technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption\nor breach in the security of any such systems or networks could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to\nliability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other\noperating, information or technology systems, including those that we outsource to providers, may fail to operate properly\nor become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially\nbeyond our control, which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities.\nThe third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third\nparties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations\nand activities may therefore be affected adversely, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by,\nor attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries\nwith whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 19\nOur business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any\nsystem, network or operational failure or disruption.\nBreaches of our security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks or other information\nsecurity incidents, may result in losses.\nOur systems involve the storage, transmission and other processing of clients’ and our personal, proprietary, confidential\nand sensitive information, and security breaches, including cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, could\nexpose us to a risk of theft, loss, destruction, gathering, monitoring, dissemination, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, or\nunauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to this information. Despite our implementation of a variety of security\nmeasures, our computer systems, networks, and data, including clients’ or our personal, proprietary, confidential and\nsensitive information, could be subject to cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, such as, among other\nthings, from physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware\nattacks, social engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or denial-of-service attacks. Our security measures also may\nbe breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, failure of our controls with respect to access to our\nsystems, malfeasance or otherwise. Any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt\nour operations and could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or otherwise adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nData privacy and security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving\nproliferation of new technologies, the use of internet-based solutions, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct\nfinancial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers, terrorists, organized\ncrime and other external parties, including foreign state actors and state-sponsored actors, any of which may see their\neffectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence. Data privacy and security risks also may derive from fraud or\nmalice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions,\nsoftware or hardware failure or other technological failure. If we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure\nto ensure effective data privacy and security relative to the type, size and complexity of our operations, we could become\nmore vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other information security incidents and, consequently, subject to significant\nregulatory penalties and reputational damage. Also, like many large enterprises, the trend in the past several years toward a\nhybrid work environment that includes a combination of in-office and remote work creates a broader attack surface for, and\npotential vulnerabilities from, cyber threats.\nWhile we generally conduct security assessments on third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information\nsecurity protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other information security incident. Some of our vendors\nmay store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information\nfrom loss, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized use or misappropriation, cyber-attacks or other information security\nincidents. In addition, our clients often use personal devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablets, which are\nparticularly vulnerable to loss and theft, as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication,\nto access our systems and networks and manage their accounts, which may heighten the risk of system failures,\ninterruptions or security breaches.\nMoreover, the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks.\nReliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately\nsafeguard their systems and networks and prevent cyber-attacks or other information security incidents could disrupt our\noperations or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal,\nconfidential, proprietary, or other sensitive information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations. In addition,\nthere is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new\ncomputing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. A vulnerability in our service providers’\nsoftware or systems, a failure of our service providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures, or a cyber-attack or other\ninformation security incident affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.\nIn recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from\nabroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information, and\nreputational harm. We and our clients have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to a wide variety of cyber-attacks\nand other similar threats, including computer viruses, ransomware and other malicious code, distributed denial-of-service\nattacks, and phishing and vishing attacks, and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and networks\nchange frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these\ntechniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. In addition,\nsuccessful cyber-attacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Because any investigation of an\ninformation security incident would be inherently unpredictable, the extent of a particular information security incident and\nthe path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear. It may take a significant amount of time before such an\n20 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\ninvestigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is\nongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, clients\nand other stakeholders may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an\ninformation security incident.\nWe could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to information security incidents, including regulatory\ninvestigations and other legal actions, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, injunctive\nrelief requiring costly compliance measures and reputational damage. Further, the market perception of the effectiveness of\nour information security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction\nwith security incidents, each of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. A breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage\nour exposure to risk or expand our business. An event that results in the loss of information also may require us to\nreconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services, which could be costly and have a negative\nimpact on our business and reputation. Although we maintain insurance coverage in the event of information theft, damage,\nor destruction from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses\nwe may incur will be covered under such policies, that the amount of insurance will be adequate to cover such losses, that\ninsurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny\ncoverage as to any future claim.\nFurther, even if not directed at us, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the\nfinancial system or on our counterparties could affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nErrors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions\nfor our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways.\nIn our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration and other business activities, we effect or process\ntransactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to manage or mitigate\noperational risks properly can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase\nthe magnitude of resulting losses. Further, remote working and other modified business practices initiated in recent years,\ncombined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and other information security\nincidents, have heightened our operational and execution risk. Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors\nthat affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.\nOur dependence on technology, and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure, exposes us to risks that\nalso can result in losses.\nOur businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to record and process, among\nother things, a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis,\nacross numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. Due to our dependence on technology and the important role it\nplays in our business operations, combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and\nother information security incidents, we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure.\nUpgrading, replacing, and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation,\nintegration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational, and operational harm. In recent years, there has been\nan acceleration in the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this\narea, and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements. Failure to ensure\nadequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and\ndeployment of key technological systems or networks or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving\nclient commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations. The failure to respond\nproperly to, and invest in, changes and advancements in technology and/or to compete for and retain employees with the\nnecessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering products\nand services comparable to those offered by our competitors, inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 21\nA failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance\npolicies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain\nassumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met. Any\nfailure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and\nprocedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we identify\nmaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial\nstatements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. In addition, there are risks that individuals, either\nemployees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding trading or\ninvestment management limitations, or committing fraud.\nFailure of any of our third-party vendors (or their vendors) to perform can result in losses.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring\ntransactions, online banking interfaces and services, and network access. Our use of third-party vendors exposes us to the\nrisk that such vendors (or their vendors) may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations, including\nwith respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory\nresponsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. While we have\nestablished risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or\npoor performance of services have in the past and could in the future have a negative effect on our ability to deliver\nproducts and services to our clients and conduct our business. Replacing these third-party vendors or performing the tasks\nthey perform for ourselves has in the past and could in the future create significant delay and expense.\nWe are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely.\nIn conducting our U.S. and non-U.S. business, we are subject to risks of loss and adverse economic impacts from various\nunfavorable political, economic, legal, public health, or other developments, including social or political instability,\nchanges in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price\ncontrols, capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax rate changes, tax court rulings and changes in laws and\nregulations. Less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various\nemerging markets. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 32% of our revenue in 2023. Our non-U.S. businesses are\nsubject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks\nand other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and\nregulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny\nto foreign companies. Moreover, the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not\nconform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions. Even within a particular jurisdiction, the standards and\nexpectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully.\nAccordingly, it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our\nrelationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a\nparticular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in\nthat market but also on our reputation generally. The failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating\ninfrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions,\nwhich could affect our business and results of operations adversely.\nWe actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint. This optimization may occur by establishing operations in\nlower-cost locations or by outsourcing to third-party vendors in various jurisdictions. These efforts expose us to the risk\nthat we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations. In addition, we are\nexposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political, public health, and similar risks generally involved in doing business in\nthose jurisdictions. The increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some\njurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. During periods of transition, greater operational risk and client\nconcern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery.\nIn addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments,\nmoney laundering, and laws that prohibit us from doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the UK Bribery Act, and economic sanctions and embargo\nprograms administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar agencies worldwide. While we have\ninvested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographic diversity of\nour operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal,\npresents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules, regulations, laws or programs and any such violation\ncould subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely.\n22 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nFailure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively.\nOur success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Through\nvarious parts of our business strategy, we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and\nexpenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial\nassets. In recent years, increased expenses have affected—and a failure to control our costs and expenses in the future,\nwhether as a result of inflation or otherwise, could affect—our earnings negatively.\nPandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, and global conflicts may\nhave a negative impact on our business and operations.\nPandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, global conflicts (including the\ncontinuing military conflicts involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and Israel and Hamas) or other similar events,\nas well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events, have had in the past, or may in the\nfuture have, a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity plans, such\nevents may still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications\nand technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, impose significant compliance costs with\nnew financial and economic sanctions regimes, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and\ncounterparties. For example, in some jurisdictions such as the Russian Federation, local market restrictions, laws, sanctions\nprograms or government intervention inhibit our clients’ and our ability to access or transfer cash or securities held for\nclients through subcustodians and clearing agencies. When such client deposit liabilities are on our consolidated balance\nsheet, we maintain a corresponding amount of cash on deposit with the subcustodian or clearing agency, which increases\nour credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over time based upon distributions on, or other activities related to,\nour clients’ assets. If the subcustodian or clearing agency were to become insolvent in circumstances not involving\nexpropriation of assets or other sovereign risk events and/or factors or events beyond our reasonable control that excuse\nperformance under force majeure or other contractual provisions, the risk of loss on such cash on deposit may potentially\nbe incurred by us. As of December 31, 2023, we held cash that accumulates in relation to Russian securities with our\nsubcustodian and/or clearing agencies for the benefit of certain clients in our Asset Servicing business which are subject to\nrestrictions that inhibit our ability to access or transfer such deposits, and which amount is expected to increase\nsignificantly over time as long as the sanctions and other relevant restrictions remain in effect. Our subcustodian is also a\nsubsidiary of a large, global financial institution with whom we have other credit exposures, which may limit the financial\nrelationship we may have with this counterparty and has in the past made, and may in the future make, compliance with\nspecific U.S. regulatory single counterparty credit limits more challenging.\nThe foregoing or similar events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets\nactivity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the U.S. or abroad, or in financial market\nsettlement functions. In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to\npredict. Please see “Strategic Risks” in this “Risk Factors” section for further description of risks associated with climate\nchange.\nCredit Risks\nFailure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance\nfor credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our\nearnings.\nWe evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit\nlosses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and\ncomplex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions through the life of these credit exposures. Challenges\nassociated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately\nestimating the impacts of those factors. Allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased\nprovisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet, which result in losses and/or\nincreased provisions for credit losses and in turn would affect earnings negatively.\nMarket volatility and/or weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit\nlosses, both of which reduce our earnings.\nCredit risk levels and our earnings can be affected by market volatility and/or weakness in the economy in general and in\nthe particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality, or a reduced demand for credit. Adverse\nchanges in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility, elevated interest rates,\nand/or weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans, which could in turn\nimpact our financial condition and results of operations negatively.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 23\nThe failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss.\nThe financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks,\nbroker-dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of\nour clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to\nour clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of\nloss. Instability in the financial markets, or in certain countries where these counterparties are domiciled, has resulted\nhistorically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy. During such periods of instability, we are exposed to\nincreased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. Changes in market perception of\nthe financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, are often based upon a variety of factors and can\nbe difficult to predict. In addition, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other\neconomically important sectors remain uncertain. Further, the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of\nother financial institutions has in the past increased, and may in the future increase, the concentration of our counterparty\nrisk. These risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated sub-custodians to a\ngreater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do. We are not\nable to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk. If a significant individual counterparty defaults on an\nobligation to us, we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nLiquidity Risks\nIf we do not manage our liquidity effectively, our business could suffer.\nLiquidity is essential for the operation of our business. Market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events\ncould have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability\nmaturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost\nand in a timely manner. If our access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, is reduced, we\nmay need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. Further evolution in the\nregulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively. Additional regulations\nmay impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Corporation and the Bank.\nGiven the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, the full impact of the\nadopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients, which,\nby their nature, require substantial liquidity. Our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues\nattendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.\nWe also manage investment products that, while not obligations of ours, may be exposed to liquidity risks. These\nproducts, such as money market and other short-term investments provide clients a right to the return of cash or assets on\nlimited notice. If clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment\nproducts do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these\ninvestment products at unfavorable prices potentially damaging our reputation with the investment community.\nFor more information on regulations and other regulatory changes relating to liquidity, see “Supervision and\nRegulation—Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business.” Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or\ncost of liquidity could affect our business adversely.\nIf the Bank is unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable to meet its\nvarious obligations.\nThe Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries. The\nCorporation relies in large part on dividends paid to it by the Bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to\nstockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s\nother subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the\nCorporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval\nunder certain circumstances. For more information on dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation—Payment of\nDividends” in Item 1, “Business.”\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on\nunfavorable terms.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments, to\naccommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients, to maintain our credit ratings in response to\nregulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes. However, our ability to access the capital markets, if\nneeded, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. Rising interest rates, disruptions in\nfinancial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors may impact our ability to\nraise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. For example, in the event of future turmoil in the banking\n24 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nindustry or other idiosyncratic events, there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will invoke the systemic risk\nexception, create additional liquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide\nliquidity. Any diminished ability to access short-term funding or capital markets to raise additional capital, if needed, could\nsubject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or\notherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals adversely.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could affect our\nborrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity adversely.\nRating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities,\nincluding long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities. Our credit ratings are subject to\nongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on the agencies’ evaluation of a\nnumber of factors, including our financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our\ncontrol, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to\nrevision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and,\nin turn, our liquidity adversely. A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being\ncompetitive in certain products. Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and\nstability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual\nor perceived, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into\ntransactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them\nor seek other service providers, or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other\nadverse effects on our business.\nThe risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market\nenvironment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global\nfinancial institutions, could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties\nperceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our\nclients, on our or our clients’ behalf, will be compromised materially. If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select\nother service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nFailure to comply with regulations and/or supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints\nthat restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings.\nVirtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated, generally by domestic and foreign governmental\nagencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. These regulations cover a variety of\nmatters, including prohibited activities, required capital levels, resolution planning, human trafficking and modern slavery,\nand data privacy and security. Some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the Bank, the\nU.S. DIF and the banking system as a whole, not our stockholders or other security holders. Regulatory violations or the\nfailure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that\nincrease costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand\nor impact our reputation adversely. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies, whether formal or\nbased upon supervisory expectations, on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of\noperations adversely. Similarly, changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws\nor regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision that impacts our operations. Changes\nby the U.S. and other governments to laws, regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may\nheighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and are subject to a comprehensive statutory and regulatory regime affecting\nall aspects of our business and operations, including oversight by governmental agencies both inside and outside the U.S.\nVarious regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory\ninitiatives. These initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and\nreputational damage in the event of a compliance violation, even if the failure to comply was inadvertent or reflects a\ndifference in interpretation. We have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring,\ndesigned to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements. We cannot provide assurance that these\nprograms and policies are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external compliance risks. For example,\nour business may be adversely impacted by actual or alleged misconduct by an employee or other negative outcomes\ncaused by human error. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory and supervisory policies or their interpretation or\nimplementation and the continued heightening of regulatory and supervisory requirements could affect us in substantial and\nunpredictable ways.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 25\nAdditionally, governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our\nbusinesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry, and these likely would involve\nadditional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies. Any such\nactions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks, lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a\nviolation, affect our ability to compete successfully, and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry\nin unpredictable ways. The full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory\nactivity is uncertain and difficult to predict. For example, we are unable to predict what, if any, changes to financial\nservices laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the U.S. Congress and what\nthe impact of any such changes will be upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws,\nregulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing\nbusinesses, activities or initiatives, which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or\nexposures. We also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the\nintroduction of new regulations or modification of existing regulations, which could require us to hold more capital or\nliquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability. For example, proposed changes to applicable\ncapital and liquidity requirements, such as the Basel III Endgame Proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in\nincreased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in share repurchases. For more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to\nBasel III and long-term debt requirements, see “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1, “Business.”\nIn addition, regulatory responses in connection with severe market downturns or unforeseen stress events may alter or\ndisrupt our planned future strategies and actions. Adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of\nother financial institutions, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the U.S.\nTreasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we\nare not subject to the same adverse developments. For example, during 2023, the FDIC took control and was appointed\nreceiver of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The failure of other banks and financial\ninstitutions and the measures taken by governments and regulators in response to these events could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations regarding data\nprivacy and security, which could increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations governing data\nprivacy and security, which may differ and potentially conflict, in various jurisdictions, and any failure to comply with\nthese laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage.\nRegulators globally are introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading\nto the loss, misappropriation or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive\ninformation. Most U.S. states, the EU and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or\nregulations concerning data privacy and security and notification of data breaches. These and other changes in laws or\nregulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase\ncompliance costs, the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information and reporting obligations in the\ncase of cyber-attacks or other information security incidents. Compliance with these laws, regulations, rules and standards\nmay require us to change and continuously update our policies, procedures and technology controls for information\nsecurity, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for\nbreach of such laws, regulations, rules and standards.\nIn the U.S., there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the\ncollection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. At\nthe federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the\nauthority of the Federal Trade Commission and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently\nconsidered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation, to\nwhich we may be subject if enacted. At the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the CCPA. Numerous\nother states also have enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and\nsecurity laws and regulations that share similarities with the CCPA. Moreover, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses\nto provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a\ndata breach.\nAt the international level, we are subject to the GDPR and UK GDPR and similar laws are in effect or being\nconsidered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the globe. While the GDPR and the UK GDPR remain\nsubstantially similar for the time being, the UK government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data\nprotection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the GDPR, to an extent. Legal\ndevelopments in the EEA and the UK also have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of\n26 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\npersonal data from the EEA and the UK to the U.S. and other so-called third countries outside the EEA and the UK that\nhave not been determined by the relevant data protection authorities to provide an adequate level of protection for privacy\nrights. Importantly, significant monetary fines have been imposed since the introduction of such stringent privacy laws in\nthe EU and the UK and regulatory expectations on governance and accountability in the protection of privacy and data\ncontinue to increase.\nFurther, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy notices and policies that are accurate,\ncomprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our\nprivacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be considered sufficient to protect us from claims,\nproceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security, considering the fast-evolving regulatory\nexpectations. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to\nhave failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances\nabout data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive,\nunfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our data privacy and security practices, even if\nunfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security\nlaws, regulations, rules, standards or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized\naccess to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal\ninformation, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial\ncosts, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement\nactions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). Any of the\nforegoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing\nbusiness, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any\nof which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nOur businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we or third parties for whom they say we are\nresponsible have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them.\nOur trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk is heightened when\nwe act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial\nmarkets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. In\naddition, regulators, tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the\nmisconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have\ndetected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the\nwrongdoing.\nClaims made or actions brought against us, whether founded or unfounded, may result in lawsuits, injunctions,\nsettlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of\noperations or require changes to our business. Even if we defend ourselves successfully, the cost of litigation is often\nsubstantial, and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and\nprospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies and stockholders, consequently\naffecting our earnings negatively.\nWe may be impacted adversely by supervisory and/or regulatory enforcement matters.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to various governmental enforcement inquiries, supervisory\nexaminations, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we\nare involved or may be directed specifically at us. In conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters, we may\nface limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business, be required to implement corrective actions that increase the\ncosts of conducting business, or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions, any of which\ncould result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us.\nThe complexity of the federal and state regulatory, supervisory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the\nglobal scope of our operations and the increased aggressiveness of the tax and regulatory environment worldwide, also\nmeans that a single event may give risk to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either\nby multiple agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities or tax authorities in different\njurisdictions. Responding to inquiries, investigations, and proceedings, regardless of the outcome of the matter, is time\nconsuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business. The outcome of such\nproceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last a number of years.\nThe number of regulatory and governmental investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and\nfines sought, has remained elevated for many firms in the financial services industry. The Corporation and other financial\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 27\ninstitutions have become subject to increased scrutiny, more intense supervision and regulation, and a higher risk of\nenforcement action, which we expect to continue. Any such heightened enforcement activity or new regulations could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to set aside adequate reserves for, or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to, pending and\nthreatened claims, with a negative effect on our earnings.\nWe estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The process is inherently subject to risk, including the risks that a judge\nor jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing\nlaw on a particular issue important to the case. Our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate.\nThe ultimate impact on us of regulatory divergence between the United Kingdom and the European Union remains\nuncertain.\nWhile regulatory standards remain largely aligned following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as\n“Brexit,” it is possible that future divergence may occur between the UK and EU; therefore, the final impact remains\nuncertain. In December 2020, the UK and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that entered into force on\nMay 1, 2021. While the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship\nbetween the UK and the EU, it generally does not address the regulation of financial services. Instead, in March 2021, the\nUK and the EU agreed upon a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues\nbetween the parties in a memorandum of understanding, which was signed on June 27, 2023.\nSince the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on December 31, 2020, the UK government has embarked on a program of\nsignificant regulatory reform. In particular, the recently enacted Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 contains\nprovisions that will eventually repeal all EU rules and regulations relating to financial services that were incorporated into\nUK law following Brexit. The UK government and the UK financial services regulatory authorities has been consulting on\na number of measures that will replace the current EU-based rules and regulations with measures that reflect the particular\nneeds of the UK market and policy objectives of the UK’s regulatory authorities. Consequently, over time it is likely that\nthe rules and regulations relating to financial services will diverge, which may result in additional compliance costs for our\nUK and EU businesses.\nIf we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could affect\nour earnings negatively.\nManaging or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and\napplicable laws is an important part of our business. Failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and\napplicable laws, manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise\nof fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction, which may impact negatively our\nearnings and growth.\nStrategic Risks\nIf we are not able to attract, retain and motivate personnel, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and\ncontinue to compensate our employees competitively. Competition for the best employees in most activities in which we\nengage can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain necessary\npersonnel. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and\nbenefits programs, our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. Our ability to\nattract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations\napplicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs. These laws and regulations may not\napply in the same manner to all financial institutions and other companies, which therefore may subject us to more\nrestrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent and may also hinder our ability to\ncompete for talent with other industries. In addition, our current or future approach to in-office and remote work\narrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees, may not be perceived as\nfavorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors and may not be conducive to a collaborative working\nenvironment, which could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. The unexpected loss of\nservices of necessary personnel, both in businesses and corporate functions, could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness because of their skills; knowledge of our markets, operations and clients; years of industry experience; and, in\nsome cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of necessary employees,\neither individually or as a group, could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely. A competitive labor market\nmay also have the effect of heightening many of these risks.\n28 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nIf we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully, our growth may be impacted negatively.\nOur growth depends upon successful, consistent development and execution of our business strategies. A failure to develop\nand execute these strategies may impact growth negatively. A failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an\nacquisition could have an adverse effect on our business. The challenges arising from the integration of an acquired\nbusiness may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners,\ndelivering enhanced products and services, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems.\nTo the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses and/or technologies, we may not achieve the\nexpected benefits of such transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of\ncapital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation. These risks may be increased if the\nacquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business\noperations.\nExecution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include\napprovals of the Federal Reserve Board and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory\nauthorities have the ability to impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies\nwhich may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. Further, acquisitions\nwe announce may not be completed, or completed in the time frame anticipated, if we do not receive the required\nregulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.\nWe are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses, which could have a negative effect on our ability\nto maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings.\nWe provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets. We compete against large,\nwell-capitalized, and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and\nservices at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a\ncompetitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it\npossible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our\nbusiness. Many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost\nstructures. The same may be said for competitors based in non-U.S. jurisdictions, where legal and regulatory environments\nmay be more favorable than those applicable to the Corporation and the Bank as U.S.-domiciled financial institutions.\nThese competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow. Pricing pressures, as a result of\nthe willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price, also may result in a\nreduction in the price we can charge for our products and services, which could have, and in some cases has had, a negative\neffect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nDamage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue.\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain clients and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on\nmaintaining our reputation. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects,\nand can arise from various sources, including, among others, the failure or perceived failure to meet or appropriately\naddress client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations; operational failures; legal and regulatory requirements;\npotential conflicts of interest; data privacy and security; social and sustainability concerns related to our business activities;\nor any other of the risks discussed in this Item 1A. Additionally, the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates, vendors or\nother third parties with which we do business, the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse\npublicity could negatively impact our reputation and significantly harm our business prospects. Damage to our reputation\nfor delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them\nand accordingly affect our earnings negatively. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating\nagencies, regulators, stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and\nthe performance of our common stock. Failure to maintain our reputation ultimately could have an adverse effect on our\nability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by other\nmembers of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively or lead to a general\nloss of confidence in, or impact market perception of, financial institutions that could negatively affect us.\nOur reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the Corporation\nand the Bank, whether true or not, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-\nmainstream news services or other parts of the internet. The proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third\nparties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, may increase the risk of negative\npublicity, including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information, which could harm our\nreputation or have other negative consequences. Furthermore, ESG-related issues have been the subject of increased focus\nby regulators and stakeholders, including outside the U.S., and particularly in Europe. Any inability to meet applicable\nrequirements or expectations, including those from conflicting U.S. and non-U.S. global expectations, may adversely\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 29\nimpact our reputation. Additionally, various stakeholders have divergent views on ESG-related matters, including in the\ncountries in which we operate and invest, as well as states and localities where we serve public sector clients. In the case of\nproxy voting, there is the inherent risk of misalignment between the proxy votes we cast on behalf of clients and all of our\nclients’ values and preferences. This divergence increases the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will\nbe perceived negatively by some stakeholders and could adversely impact our reputation and business.\nWe need to invest in innovation constantly, and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings\nnegatively.\nOur success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human\nresources in innovation, particularly in light of the current “FinTech” environment, in which the financial services industry\nis undergoing rapid technological changes and financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, and\ndeveloping potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. Our investment is directed at\ngenerating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands\nof the marketplace. Among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that\nkeeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. Our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of\nour products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients.\nEffectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings is important to our success. Failure to keep pace with\nour competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings adversely. There are\nsubstantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts, including an increased risk that new and emerging\ntechnologies may expose us to increased data privacy and security and other information technology threats. We must\ninvest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services, and expected timetables for\nthe introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may\nnot be met. Further, our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require start-up\ncosts while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all.\nFailure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service\nofferings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively.\nThe success of our innovation efforts depends, in part, on the successful implementation of new product and service\ninitiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must\naccurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively. Our\nidentification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective\nresponses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in\nnew product and service offerings.\nOur success with large, complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting\nstandards in various jurisdictions.\nA significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients which requires an\nunderstanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions. Any failure to\nunderstand, address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation\nnegatively. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and\ncontrols. If we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully, we could incur financial loss, suffer damage to our\nreputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or\nconstraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive. In addition, our businesses\nand the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to understand fully the implications of\nchanges in legal or regulatory requirements, our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework\nto address those changes in a timely fashion. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with\nchanges in the financial markets, legal and regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service\nproviders or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with\napplicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. These risks are magnified as client requirements become\nmore complex and as our increasingly global business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes\nacross multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.\nWe may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings.\nWe may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or\ninvestment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments,\neven though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. The risk that we will decide to take\nactions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity\nmarkets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.\n30 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nOur operations, businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or\nconcerns related thereto.\nRisks related to climate change may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations adversely. The\nphysical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels, and an increase in the\nfrequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such developments could disrupt our operations\nand resilience capabilities, those of our clients, or third parties on which we rely. Further, the consequences of climate\nchange could negatively impact our clients’ ability to pay outstanding loans, reduce the value of collateral, or result in\ninsurance shortfalls.\nClimate change could also result in transition risk arising from changes in policy, regulations, technology, business\npractices or market preferences toward a lower-carbon economy which could adversely impact us or our clients. These\nimpacts could result in increased operational or compliance costs, higher energy expenses, additional taxes, and the\ndevaluation of assets.\nOur reputation and business prospects may also be damaged if we do not, or are perceived not to, effectively prepare\nfor the potential business and operational opportunities and risks associated with climate change, including through the\ndevelopment and marketing of effective and competitive new products and services designed to address our clients’ climate\nrisk-related needs. We also face regulatory and liability risk associated with greenwashing claims, a failure to execute on\nour public climate-related commitments, or by association with individuals, entities, industries or products that may be\ninconsistent with our stated positions on climate change issues. At the same time, certain financial institutions have also\nbeen subject to significant scrutiny by regulatory agencies and government officials and other criticism and negative\npublicity as a result of their decisions to reduce their involvement in certain industries or projects perceived to be\nassociated with climate change. If we do not identify, quantify, and mitigate such risks successfully, we may experience\nfinancial losses, litigation, reputational harm, and losses of investor and stakeholder confidence.\nEven as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climate-related information by companies across sectors,\nmethodologies and data used to conduct more robust climate-related risk analyses are still in development. Third-party\nexposures, emissions, climate-related risks, and other data are limited in availability and variable in quality. Modeling\ncapabilities across the industry to analyze climate-related risks and interconnections are improving but remain imperfect.\nThese legislative and regulatory uncertainties along with inconsistencies and conflicts of policy across jurisdictions, and\nchanges regarding climate-related risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance,\ncredit, reputational and other risks and costs.\nOther Risks\nThe systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks, as well as for other business purposes, are\ninherently limited, may not be effective in all cases and, in any case, cannot eliminate all risks that we face.\nWe use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories, as well as for other business\npurposes. While we assess and improve these systems and models on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that they,\nalong with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that they will adequately mitigate\nany risk or loss to us. As with any systems and models, there are inherent limitations because they involve techniques and\njudgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they\nanticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Further, these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the\nmagnitude of the risks we face or they may not be effective against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated. Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These\nassumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. Models\nbased on historical data sets might not be accurate predicators of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict\nfuture outcomes may degrade over time due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or\ncustomer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic\nevents). Consequently, the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our\nbusinesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes, each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. Errors in the underlying model or model assumptions, or\ninadequate model assumptions, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss or\nnoncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 31\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations and challenges to our tax positions may affect our earnings negatively.\nBoth U.S. and non-U.S. governments and tax authorities, including states and municipalities, from time to time issue new,\nor modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of\nthose laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and our actions taken in response to, or reliance\nupon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively.\nIn the course of our business, we are sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, including\nstates and municipalities, regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or\namount of taxable income, deductions, tax credits, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which may\nrequire a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively.\nChanges in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nNew accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting\nstandards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or bank regulatory agencies, or otherwise reflected in\nGAAP, potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes are\ndifficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the\nrevised treatment of certain transactions or activities, or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior\nperiods.\nOur ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by\nU.S. banking laws and regulations, applicable provisions of Delaware law, or our failure to pay full and timely\ndividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our Board of\nDirectors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under Delaware law. Although we have declared\ncash dividends on shares of our common stock historically, we are not required to do so. In addition to the approval of our\nBoard of Directors, our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make\nother capital distributions, is dependent upon, among other things, their payment being made in accordance with the capital\nplan rules and capital adequacy standards of the Federal Reserve Board.\nA significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, our ability to pay dividends\non the Corporation’s common stock will depend in large part on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the\nCorporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries\ncan supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Corporation in the\nfuture will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval under certain\ncircumstances. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation in the future, our ability to pay dividends on the\nCorporation’s common stock would be affected adversely.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or\nany of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of any assets\non any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do\nnot declare and pay in full dividends on our Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series D Preferred Stock)\nand Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series E Preferred Stock). Further, in the future if we default on\ncertain of our outstanding debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such\npayments have been brought current.\nAny reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend, or even our failure to maintain the common stock\ndividend level in a manner comparable to our competitors, likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our\ncommon stock. For more information on dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation—Payment of Dividends”\nand “Supervision and Regulation—Capital Planning and Stress Testing” in Item 1, “Business.”\nAdditionally, on October 19, 2021, we announced that our Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase\nup to 25.0 million shares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock. The Corporation retains the ability to repurchase\nwhen circumstances warrant and applicable regulation permits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, imposes a 1% excise\ntax on the fair market value of stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. There have been recent proposals to\nsignificantly increase this excise tax rate. Any such material increases may impact our future strategies relating to the\nreturn of capital to our shareholders, including the size of, or execution against, current or future repurchase programs\nrelated to shares of our common stock.\nITEM 1B – UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n32 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nITEM 1C – CYBERSECURITY\nNorthern Trust understands the importance of managing cybersecurity risk to ensure the safety and security of our data and\nsystems. The Business Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (Business Risk Committee), which reports regularly to\nthe Board, oversees management’s actions to identify, assess, mitigate and remediate material issues related to\ncybersecurity and technology risk as part of our enterprise risk management program and processes. The Cybersecurity\nRisk Oversight Subcommittee, chaired by the former chief information officer and chief transformation officer of a Fortune\n50 company, assists the Business Risk Committee in discharging its oversight duties with respect to cybersecurity risk and\nmeets on a regular basis to provide for an even deeper focus on, and governance framework around, cybersecurity risks\ninherent in the Corporation’s business. The Business Risk Committee, Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee, and\nthe Board are regularly briefed on the organization’s cybersecurity posture by senior management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Risk Officer, Head of Non-Financial Risk and Chief\nInformation Risk Officer (CIRO), and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The CISO, a Certified Information\nSystems Security Professional (CISSP) with nearly 30 years of relevant experience, reports to the CIO and is responsible\nfor identifying, managing, and, if necessary, remediating cybersecurity risk to ensure the protection of our data, network,\nand systems. The primary management-level committees responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk are the\nInformation Technology Oversight Committee, chaired by the CIO, who has over 20 years of experience in technology\nleadership roles, and the Information Technology Risk Committee, chaired by the CIRO, who has over 20 years of\ncybersecurity and risk management experience.\nEffective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is crucial in an\nenvironment of increasing cybersecurity threats and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate\nexpectations and required practices. Northern Trust’s cybersecurity and technology risk management program provides the\noverall structure for managing the respective risks in a sustainable manner supported by an organizational structure that\nreflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the business.\nThe program is supported by the Cyber and Technology Risk Management Policy and Framework approved by the\nBusiness Risk Committee. The Cyber and Technology Risk Management Policy and Framework are based on the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and provide a comprehensive overview of\ncybersecurity and technology risk management governance activities pertaining to the confidentiality of information,\nintegrity of systems, data and processes, and the availability of business functions that may be adversely impacted. These\ngovernance processes, internal controls, and risk management practices, which are part of our enterprise risk management\nprogram and processes, are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to Northern Trust’s overall risk appetite and the\ninherent risk in the markets in which Northern Trust operates. Northern Trust employees are responsible for promoting\ncybersecurity as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards to safeguard data and business systems. In cases\nwhere Northern Trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry\nstandards and their ability to protect information. Any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.\nIn addition to the cybersecurity controls managed and monitored within the organization, Northern Trust uses external\nthird-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness of our cybersecurity program and controls. These teams\nperform program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments, and reviews of Northern Trust’s\nvulnerability to cyber-attacks. Northern Trust also operates a global security operations center for threat identification and\nresponse. This center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the business and alerts the\norganization in accordance with its documented Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan.\nThe Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan was developed to respond to cybersecurity incidents. A cybersecurity\nincident can include, but is not limited to, disruptions of service, denials-of-service, compromises of information systems,\ndata exfiltration or data corruption. The plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address\nmatters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions, and status to senior management, including the\nCISO, CIRO, and appropriate stakeholders. The plan design includes enterprise-level response plans, including escalation\nto appropriate Board-level governance committees, and is reviewed, tested, and updated regularly.\nNorthern Trust’s disclosure procedures and controls also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to\nensure an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents. Northern Trust maintains compliance\nprograms to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material, nonpublic\ninformation, including instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents.\nNorthern Trust also maintains a comprehensive Information and Cyber Security Training and Awareness practice\nproviding baseline and targeted education and awareness for employees and contractors. This program includes at least one\nrequired annual online training class for all employees and contractors, supplemental refresher training throughout the year,\ntargeted training based on roles and risk levels, multiple simulated phishing and vishing attacks with associated training,\nthe distribution of regular cybersecurity awareness materials, and the designation of individuals as Information Security\nand Privacy champions within the businesses.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 33\nTo date, Northern Trust has not identified any cybersecurity threats or incidents that have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite\nour efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents, or provide assurances that we have not\nexperienced an undetected cybersecurity threat or incident. For more information about these risks, see, “Breaches of our\nsecurity measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents,\nmay result in losses,” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nITEM 2 – PROPERTIES\nThe executive offices of the Corporation and the Bank are located at 50 South La Salle Street in Chicago. This Bank-\nowned building is occupied by various divisions of Northern Trust’s businesses. Adjacent to this building is one office\nbuilding in which the Bank leases space principally for corporate support functions. Financial services are provided by the\nBank and other subsidiaries of the Corporation through a network of offices in 24 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and\nacross 22 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. The majority of those offices are\nleased. The Bank’s other primary U.S. operations are located in five facilities: a leased facility at 333 South Wabash\nAvenue in Chicago; a leased facility in Tempe, Arizona; and one leased and two Bank-owned supplementary operations/\ndata center buildings located in the western suburbs of Chicago. A majority of the Bank’s London-based staff is located at\na leased facility at Canary Wharf in London. Additional support and operations activity originates from four facilities in\nIndia, one facility in Ireland, and one facility in the Philippines, all of which are leased. The Bank and the Corporation’s\nother subsidiaries operate from various other facilities in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle\nEast, most of which are leased.\nThe Corporation believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for its business needs. The\nCorporation continues to evaluate its owned and leased facilities and may determine from time to time that certain of its\nfacilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Corporation will be able to dispose of any\nexcess facilities or that it will not incur costs in connection with such dispositions, which could be material to its operating\nresults in a given period.\nFor additional information relating to properties and lease commitments, refer to Note 8, “Buildings and Equipment”\nand Note 9, “Lease Commitments,” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and which\ninformation is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 3 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information presented under the caption “Legal Proceedings” in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,”\nincluded under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n34 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITEM – INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following sets forth certain information with regard to each executive officer of the Corporation.\nMichael G.

For a discussion\nrelated to the consolidated results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K), which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission on February 28, 2023.\nRevenue\nNorthern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from Noninterest Income that primarily consists of Trust, Investment\nand Other Servicing Fees. Net Interest Income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of Interest Income\ngenerated by earning assets, net of Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds.\nRevenue in 2023 of $6.77 billion increased $12.3 million from $6.76 billion in 2022. Noninterest Income represented\n71% and 72% of total revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and totaled $4.79 billion in 2023, which decreased $82.5\nmillion, or 2%, from $4.87 billion in 2022.\nNoninterest Income in 2023 decreased primarily due to lower Foreign Exchange Trading Income and lower Trust,\nInvestment and Other Servicing Fees, partially offset by lower investment securities losses compared to the prior year and\nhigher Other Operating Income. Investment Security Gains (Losses), net reflected $169.5 million of losses in 2023 as\ncompared to $214.0 million of losses in 2022. Both losses in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net in 2023 and 2022\nwere due to a repositioning of the available for sale debt securities portfolio. Other Operating Income of $228.7 million in\n2023 increased $37.4 million, or 19%, from $191.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher income associated\nwith a market value increase in supplemental compensation plans and higher banking and credit-related services fees.\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees of $4.36 billion in 2023 decreased $70.8 million, or 2%, from $4.43 billion in\n2022, primarily due to net asset outflows and unfavorable markets, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and\nfavorable currency translation.\nNet Interest Income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis in 2023 of $2.04 billion increased $106.7 million, or 6%,\nfrom $1.93 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet\nmix. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to 1.56% in 2023 from 1.39% in 2022, primarily due to higher\naverage interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable funding mix shift. Average earning assets decreased $8.0 billion,\nor 6%, from $138.8 billion in 2022 to $130.8 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower client deposits, partially offset by\nhigher borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in lower funding of earning assets.\n40 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAdditional information regarding Northern Trust’s revenue by type is provided in the following table.\nTABLE 5: REVENUE\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees $ 4,361.8 $ 4,432.6 $ 4,361.1\nForeign Exchange Trading Income 203.9 288.6 292.6\nTreasury Management Fees 31.6 39.3 44.3\nSecurity Commissions and Trading Income 135.0 136.2 140.2\nOther Operating Income 228.7 191.3 243.9\nInvestment Security Gains (Losses), net (169.5) (214.0) (0.3)\nTotal Noninterest Income $ 4,791.5 $ 4,874.0 $ 5,081.8\nNet Interest Income(1) 1,982.0 1,887.2 1,382.7\nTotal Revenue $ 6,773.5 $ 6,761.2 $ 6,464.5\n(1) Net Interest Income stated on a GAAP basis.

Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest\ncomponent of Asset Servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client AUC/A, transaction volumes and the number of\naccounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with\neach client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values,\nquarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are\nasset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are\nbased generally on market values of client AUM management throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to\ncalculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 41\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSecurities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes;\nand the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they\nhave borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical\nservices, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services\nprovided or a fixed fee.\nCustody and Fund Administration fees decreased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to unfavorable lagged markets.\nInvestment Management fees in 2023 decreased from 2022 primarily due to asset outflows, partially offset by lower money\nmarket fund fee waivers.\nThe following tables provide a breakdown of the Asset Servicing assets under custody and AUM.\nTABLE 7: ASSET SERVICING ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY\nDECEMBER 31, CHANGE\n($ In Billions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 / 2022 2022 / 2021\nNorth America $ 6,373.4 $ 5,703.1 $ 6,566.4 12 % (13) %\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 3,493.9 3,037.6 3,894.3 15 (22)\nAsia Pacific 847.3 823.3 898.5 3 (8)\nSecurities Lending 167.4 148.3 195.6 13 (24)\nTotal Assets Under Custody $ 10,882.0 $ 9,712.3 $ 11,554.8 12 % (16) %\nTABLE 8: ASSET SERVICING ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT\nDECEMBER 31, CHANGE\n($ In Billions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 / 2022 2022 / 2021\nNorth America $ 681.3 $ 586.0 $ 789.2 16 % (26) %\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 141.8 121.3 148.5 17 (18)\nAsia Pacific 41.5 42.5 57.7 (2) (26)\nSecurities Lending 167.4 148.3 195.6 13 (24)\nTotal Assets Under Management $ 1,032.0 $ 898.1 $ 1,191.0 15 % (25) %\nCash and other assets deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities borrowed from custody clients are managed\nby Northern Trust and are included in assets under custody and under management.

Earning assets—including\nFederal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with\nBanks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, Securities, Loans and Leases, and Other Interest-Earning Assets\n—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing liabilities that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior\nNotes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements\nto Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets also are funded by noninterest-bearing funds, which include demand\ndeposits and Stockholders’ Equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and\ninterest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client\ncompensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income.\nNet interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other\nsources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is\ncalculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets.\nNet Interest Income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset\nyields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative\npurposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable;\nhowever, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP\nbasis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Supplemental Information—Reconciliation to Fully Taxable\nEquivalent” within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nsection.\n46 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables present an analysis of average daily balances and interest rates affecting Net Interest Income and an\nanalysis of Net Interest Income changes.\nTABLE 20: AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME (INTEREST AND RATE\n(1)\nON A FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS)\n2023 2022 2021\nAVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE\n($ In Millions) INTEREST BALANCE RATE(8) INTEREST BALANCE RATE(8) INTEREST BALANCE RATE(8)\nINTEREST-EARNING ASSETS\nFederal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits $ 1,462.3 $ 31,205.4 4.69 % $ 472.0 $ 36,248.8 1.30 % $ 11.3 $ 39,028.2 0.03 %\nInterest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks(2) 130.1 4,333.9 3.00 46.6 4,192.5 1.11 9.1 5,779.7 0.16\nFederal Funds Sold 0.3 6.1 4.92 0.1 5.5 3.22 — 0.1 0.41\nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell(3) 1,585.2 950.9 166.71 103.7 1,071.2 9.68 3.5 1,067.4 0.33\nDebt Securities\nAvailable For Sale 1,059.7 24,356.6 4.35 612.8 32,060.2 1.91 497.6 38,986.9 1.28\nHeld To Maturity 478.0 25,511.9 1.87 289.5 22,970.0 1.26 164.3 20,617.0 0.80\nTrading Account 0.1 0.5 13.50 0.4 12.1 3.84 — 0.6 1.59\nTotal Debt Securities 1,537.8 49,869.0 3.08 902.7 55,042.3 1.64 661.9 59,604.5 1.11\nLoans and Leases(4) 2,556.8 42,177.0 6.06 1,348.0 41,030.6 3.28 715.6 37,207.5 1.92\nOther Interest-Earning Assets(5) 110.0 2,259.0 4.87 50.2 1,248.1 4.03 40.7 1,185.6 3.43\nTotal Interest-Earning Assets 7,382.5 130,801.3 5.64 2,923.3 138,839.0 2.11 1,442.1 143,873.0 1.00\nCash and Due from Banks and Other Central Bank Deposits(6) — 1,771.6 — — 2,069.5 — — 2,285.9 —\nOther Noninterest-Earning Assets — 10,076.3 — — 11,643.4 — — 10,204.3 —\nTotal Assets $ — $ 142,649.2 — % $ — $ 152,551.9 — % $ — $ 156,363.2 — %\nAVERAGE SOURCE OF FUNDS\nDeposits\nSavings, Money Market, and Other $ 689.2 $ 24,172.4 2.85 % $ 222.3 $ 30,205.0 0.74 % $ 12.8 $ 28,339.0 0.05 %\nSavings Certificates and Other Time 151.9 3,341.2 4.54 17.8 1,059.7 1.68 4.8 887.2 0.55\nNon-U.S. Offices – Interest-Bearing 1,844.2 60,008.6 3.07 362.7 65,031.3 0.56 (78.9) 69,713.4 (0.11)\nTotal Interest-Bearing Deposits 2,685.3 87,522.2 3.07 602.8 96,296.0 0.63 (61.3) 98,939.6 (0.06)\nFederal Funds Purchased 256.9 5,144.3 4.99 34.1 1,407.8 2.43 (0.4) 190.6 (0.19)\nSecurities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase(3) 1,541.1 401.5 383.84 90.7 433.6 20.94 0.2 232.0 0.07\nOther Borrowings(7) 542.5 10,339.5 5.25 126.2 5,463.5 2.31 14.2 5,049.8 0.28\nSenior Notes 170.0 2,734.0 6.22 92.7 2,756.0 3.36 48.3 2,856.4 1.69\nLong-Term Debt 147.2 2,586.0 5.69 44.0 1,258.9 3.49 21.1 1,166.1 1.81\nFloating Rate Capital Debt — — — — — — 1.7 218.4 0.78\nTotal Interest-Bearing Liabilities 5,343.0 108,727.5 4.91 990.5 107,615.8 0.92 23.8 108,652.9 0.02\nInterest Rate Spread — — 0.73 — — 1.19 — — 0.98\nDemand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits — 17,723.3 — — 29,296.4 — — 31,143.5 —\nOther Noninterest-Bearing Liabilities — 4,701.6 — — 4,558.3 — — 4,869.8 —\nStockholders’ Equity — 11,496.8 — — 11,081.4 — — 11,697.0 —\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ — $ 142,649.2 — % $ — $ 152,551.9 — % $ — $ 156,363.2 — %\nNet Interest Income/Margin (FTE Adjusted) $ 2,039.5 $ — 1.56 % $ 1,932.8 $ — 1.39 % $ 1,418.3 $ — 0.99 %\nNet Interest Income/Margin (Unadjusted) $ 1,982.0 $ — 1.52 % $ 1,887.2 $ — 1.36 % $ 1,382.7 $ — 0.96 %\n(1) Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses.\nThe operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source\nincome and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system.

Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current year\nwas driven by higher interest rates. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 69% and 68% of total\naverage Interest-Bearing Deposits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Average Total Interest-\nBearing Liabilities increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, to $108.7 billion in 2023 from $107.6 billion in 2022. The balances\nwithin short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes\nin the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net\nnoninterest-bearing funds decreased $9.1 billion, or 29%, to $22.1 billion in 2023 from $31.2 billion in 2022, primarily\nresulting from lower levels of Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits. Average Demand and Other Noninterest-\nBearing Deposits decreased $11.6 billion, or 40%, to $17.7 billion in 2023 from $29.3 billion in 2022. The average rate on\ntotal source of funds was 4.07% in 2023 and 0.70% in 2022.\nStockholders’ Equity\nStockholders’ Equity averaged $11.5 billion in 2023, compared with $11.1 billion in 2022. The increase in average\nStockholders’ Equity of $415.4 million, or 4%, was primarily due to higher Retained Earnings. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend at $0.75 per share. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, the Corporation, through common stock dividends and repurchase of 4,384,678 shares of\ncommon stock, returned $977.7 million in capital to common stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCorporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.75 per share in the third quarter from $0.70 per share in\nthe second quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Corporation, through common stock dividends and\nrepurchase of 311,536 shares of common stock, returned $648.4 million in capital to common stockholders.\nThe Corporation’s current stock repurchase authorization to repurchase up to 25.0 million shares was approved by the\nBoard of Directors in October 2021. Shares are repurchased by the Corporation to, among other things, manage the\nCorporation’s capital levels. Repurchased shares are used for general purposes, including the issuance of shares under\nstock option and other equity incentive plans. The repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors has no\nexpiration date, thus the Corporation retains the ability to resume repurchases thereunder when circumstances warrant and\napplicable regulations permit. Please refer to Note 13, “Stockholders’ Equity,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data.”\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThere was a $24.5 million Provision for Credit Losses in 2023, as compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of $12.0\nmillion in 2022. The provision during 2023 was primarily due to a $16.5 million increase in the reserve evaluated on a\ncollective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The increase in the provision\nfor loans was primarily seen in the commercial real estate portfolio, driven by an increase in the size and duration of the\nportfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, methodology updates, and credit quality deterioration on a small\nnumber of loans. The release of credit reserves in undrawn loan commitments and letters of credit during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 is primarily in the commercial and institutional portfolio, reflecting a combination of credit quality\nimprovements, an improved macroeconomic outlook for that segment, and methodology updates. The remainder of the\nprovision was due to $5.0 million in charge-offs and a $3.0 million increase in the individual reserve. The prior-year\nprovision primarily reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by weaker macroeconomic\nconditions at the time and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in credit quality. The increase in the collective\nbasis reserve was primarily reflected in certain commercial portfolios.\nNet charge-offs in 2023 totaled $5.0 million resulting from $8.7 million of charge-offs and $3.7 million of recoveries,\ncompared to net recoveries of $4.2 million in 2022 resulting from $6.0 million of charge-offs and $10.2 million of\nrecoveries. For additional discussion of the Allowance for Credit Losses, refer to the “Asset Quality” section.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 49\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest Expense for 2023 increased from 2022, primarily reflecting increased Other Operating Expense, Equipment\nand Software, and Compensation.\nThe components of Noninterest Expense and a discussion of significant changes during 2023 and 2022 are provided below.\nTABLE 22: NONINTEREST EXPENSE\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, CHANGE\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 / 2022 2022 / 2021\nCompensation $ 2,321.8 $ 2,248.0 $ 2,011.0 3 % 12 %\nEmployee Benefits 405.2 437.4 431.4 (7) 1\nOutside Services 906.5 880.3 849.4 3 4\nEquipment and Software 945.5 838.8 736.3 13 14\nOccupancy 232.3 219.1 208.7 6 5\nOther Operating Expense 472.9 359.3 299.1 32 20\nTotal Noninterest Expense $ 5,284.2 $ 4,982.9 $ 4,535.9 6 % 10 %\nCompensation\nCompensation expense, the largest component of Noninterest Expense, increased in 2023 from 2022, primarily reflecting\nhigher salary expense, partially offset by lower incentives. Severance-related charges were $36.7 million in 2023 as\ncompared to $30.4 million in 2022. Full-time equivalent employees totaled approximately 23,100 at December 31, 2023,\ndown 2% from approximately 23,600 at December 31, 2022.\nEmployee Benefits\nEmployee Benefits expense in 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily due to a $44.1 million pension settlement charge in\n2022.\nOutside Services\nOutside Services expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily reflecting higher technical services costs, partially offset\nby lower consulting services.\nEquipment and Software\nEquipment and Software expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to higher software amortization and higher\nsoftware costs.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to net rent increases and charges related to reducing\nNorthern Trust’s real estate footprint.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther Operating Expense in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily reflecting an $84.6 million FDIC special assessment and a\n$25.6 million charge related to the write-off of an investment in a client capability.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the deposit insurance\nfund associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. In conjunction with the special assessment, $84.6 million was\nrecognized as an accrued liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The final amount of the total special\nassessment incurred by Northern Trust may be adjusted as the FDIC's loss estimates change. The final rule becomes\neffective on April 1, 2024, with the first payment due on June 28, 2024.\nPlease refer to Note 19, “Other Operating Expense” included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData,” for additional details related to other operating expenses.\n50 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe 2023 Provision for Income Taxes was $357.5 million, representing an effective rate of 24.4%. This compares with a\nProvision for Income Taxes of $430.3 million and an effective rate of 24.4% in 2022.\nSee Note 20, “Income Taxes,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for more\ninformation on income taxes.\nREPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION\nThe following information summarizes our consolidated results of operations by reporting segment for 2023 compared to\n2022. For a discussion related to the consolidated results of operations by reporting segment for 2022 compared\nto 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,” in our 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2023.\nNorthern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth\nManagement. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients\nprimarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support\nfunctions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management.\nReporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by\naccounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets,\nliabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology.\nUnder the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on a fully\ntaxable equivalent (FTE) basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest\nincome. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nEquity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory\nconsiderations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of\nlevels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management\nreporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Transfers of\nincome and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between\nreporting segments. Northern Trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other\nfinancial institutions.\nRevenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception\nof non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions,\ndivestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are\nreported within the Other segment.\nReporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also\nsubject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective\nbasis.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 51\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the earnings and average assets for the Corporation.\nTABLE 23: CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, CHANGE\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 / 2022 2022 / 2021\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees $ 4,361.8 $ 4,432.6 $ 4,361.1 (2) % 2 %\nForeign Exchange Trading Income 203.9 288.6 292.6 (29) (1)\nOther Noninterest Income 225.8 152.8 428.1 48 (64)\nTotal Noninterest Income 4,791.5 4,874.0 5,081.8 (2) (4)\nNet Interest Income 1,982.0 1,887.2 1,382.7 5 36\nRevenue 6,773.5 6,761.2 6,464.5 — 5\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses 24.5 12.0 (81.5) N/M N/M\nNoninterest Expense 5,284.2 4,982.9 4,535.9 6 10\nIncome before Income Taxes 1,464.8 1,766.3 2,010.1 (17) (12)\nProvision for Income Taxes 357.5 430.3 464.8 (17) (7)\nNet Income $ 1,107.3 $ 1,336.0 $ 1,545.3 (17) % (14) %\nAverage Assets $ 142,649.2 $ 152,551.9 $ 156,363.2 (6) % (2) %\nSegment results are stated on an FTE basis which has no impact on Net Income.

Net\ninterest margin on an FTE basis increased to 1.29% from 1.03%. Average earning assets of $92.5 billion, decreased $12.3\nbillion, or 12%, from $104.8 billion in the prior year.

Funding sources were primarily comprised of non-U.S. custody-related interest-bearing\ndeposits, which averaged $60.0 billion in 2023 as compared to $65.0 billion in 2022.\nAsset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses\nThere was a Provision for Credit Losses of $0.5 million for 2023 compared to a Provision for Credit Losses of $2.4 million\nfor 2022. The 2023 Provision for Credit Losses was primarily due to credit quality deterioration on a small number of\nloans, offset by a better overall macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for Credit Losses during 2022 primarily reflected\nweaker macroeconomic conditions at the time.\nAsset Servicing Noninterest Expense\nAsset Servicing Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense\nallocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services,\nincreased in 2023 from 2022.

The Provision for Credit Losses during 2022 reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective\nbasis driven by weaker economic conditions at the time and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in portfolio\nquality. The 2022 increase in the collective basis reserve was primarily reflected in certain commercial portfolios.\nWealth Management Noninterest Expense\nWealth Management Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense\nallocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services,\n54 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nincreased in 2023 from 2022.

The amortization of amounts retained in AOCI will\noffset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from transferring the securities\nat fair value.\nFor additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4, “Securities,” provided in Item 8,\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 61\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans\nFor additional information relating to the loan portfolio, refer to Note 5, “Loans,” and Note 7, “Concentrations of Credit\nRisk” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nThe following table presents the remaining maturity of loans by segment and class as of December 31, 2023.\nTABLE 34: REMAINING MATURITY OF LOANS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFIVE TO\nONE YEAR OR ONE TO FIVE FIFTEEN OVER FIFTEEN\n(In Millions) TOTAL LESS YEARS YEARS YEARS\nU.S.:\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional $ 11,555.3 $ 4,906.4 $ 6,362.2 $ 285.8 $ 0.9\nCommercial Real Estate 5,134.2 787.3 3,439.1 907.8 —\nOther 5,944.8 5,944.8 — — —\nPersonal\nPrivate Client 14,360.0 9,170.2 5,060.1 129.4 0.3\nResidential Real Estate 6,327.1 260.7 926.8 1,621.2 3,518.4\nOther 1,088.3 1,088.3 — — —\nTotal U.S. $ 44,409.7 $ 22,157.7 $ 15,788.2 $ 2,944.2 $ 3,519.6\nNon-U.S.:\nNon-U.S. - Commercial $ 2,778.5 $ 2,686.2 $ 92.3 $ — $ —\nNon-U.S. - Personal 428.8 316.8 51.9 29.4 30.7\nTotal Non-U.S. $ 3,207.3 $ 3,003.0 $ 144.2 $ 29.4 $ 30.7\nTotal Loans $ 47,617.0 $ 25,160.7 $ 15,932.4 $ 2,973.6 $ 3,550.3\nNote: Non-U.S. and Other U.S. loans primarily include short duration exposures related to custodied client investments.\n62 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 35: INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF LOANS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFIVE TO\nONE YEAR ONE TO FIVE FIFTEEN OVER FIFTEEN\n(In Millions) TOTAL OR LESS YEARS YEARS YEARS\nFixed Rate:\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional $ 294.5 $ 114.3 $ 135.8 $ 43.5 $ 0.9\nCommercial Real Estate 180.6 35.1 128.6 16.9 —\nNon-U.S. 26.9 26.9 — — —\nTotal Commercial $ 502.0 $ 176.3 $ 264.4 $ 60.4 $ 0.9\nPersonal\nPrivate Client $ 426.1 $ 91.7 $ 333.7 $ 0.5 $ 0.2\nResidential Real Estate 773.6 70.3 266.2 421.9 15.2\nNon-U.S. 9.8 0.1 9.7 — —\nTotal Personal $ 1,209.5 $ 162.1 $ 609.6 $ 422.4 $ 15.4\nTotal Fixed Rate $ 1,711.5 $ 338.4 $ 874.0 $ 482.8 $ 16.3\nVariable Rate:\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional $ 11,260.8 $ 4,792.1 $ 6,226.4 $ 242.3 $ —\nCommercial Real Estate 4,953.6 752.2 3,310.5 890.9 —\nNon-U.S. 2,751.6 2,659.3 92.3 — —\nOther 5,944.8 5,944.8 — — —\nTotal Commercial $ 24,910.8 $ 14,148.4 $ 9,629.2 $ 1,133.2 $ —\nPersonal\nPrivate Client $ 13,933.9 $ 9,078.5 $ 4,726.4 $ 128.9 $ 0.1\nResidential Real Estate 5,553.5 190.4 660.6 1,199.3 3,503.2\nNon-U.S. 419.0 316.7 42.2 29.4 30.7\nOther 1,088.3 1,088.3 — — —\nTotal Personal $ 20,994.7 $ 10,673.9 $ 5,429.2 $ 1,357.6 $ 3,534.0\nTotal Variable Rate $ 45,905.5 $ 24,822.3 $ 15,058.4 $ 2,490.8 $ 3,534.0\nTotal Loans $ 47,617.0 $ 25,160.7 $ 15,932.4 $ 2,973.6 $ 3,550.3\nNonaccrual Assets and 90 Days Past Due Loans\nNonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (OREO).

In addition\nto the negative impact on Net Interest Income and the risk of credit losses, nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs\ndue to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of\nchanges in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses\nthrough the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative\nfactors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses\nrelated to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is\ndetermined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of\nfinancial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does\nnot share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an\nindividual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent\non any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many\nof which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss\nReserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic\nResearch Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby\nletters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $178.7 million, $26.9 million, $12.7 million, and $0.9\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Allowance for Credit Losses related to loans, undrawn loan\ncommitments and standby letters of credit, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets, was $144.3 million, $38.5\nmillion, $16.0 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.

If financial\nassets are deemed not to share similar risk characteristics, an individual assessment is warranted.\nThe allowance evaluated on a collective basis for loans increased $31.4 million to $165.3 million at December 31,\n2023, compared with $133.9 million at December 31, 2022, primarily seen in the commercial real estate portfolio, driven\nby an increase in the size and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, and methodology\nupdates. The remainder of the provision was due to charge-offs. The allowance evaluated on a collective basis for undrawn\nloan commitments and letters of credit decreased $11.6 million to $26.9 million at December 31, 2023, compared with\n$38.5 million at December 31, 2022, primarily in the commercial and institutional portfolio, reflecting a combination of\ncredit quality improvements, an improved macroeconomic outlook for that segment, and methodology updates.\nOverall Allowance: The reserve evaluated on an individual and collective basis resulted in a total Allowance for Credit\nLosses of $220.4 million at December 31, 2023, compared with $200.9 million at the end of 2022. The allowance of\n$178.7 million assigned to Loans, as a percentage of total Loans, was 0.38% at December 31, 2023, which increased from\na $144.3 million allowance assigned to Loans, representing 0.34% of total Loans at December 31, 2022. Allowances\nassigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $26.9 million and $38.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n66 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures in 2023 included continued investments in public cloud technologies and to enhance Northern Trust’s\nsoftware capabilities, as well as renovation and relocation projects to reduce our real estate footprint and modernize our\nexisting offices for new ways of working. Capital expenditures for 2023 totaled $675.8 million, of which $559.3 million\nwas for software, $56.4 million was for computer hardware, $56.0 million was for building and leasehold improvements,\nand $4.1 million was for furnishings. These capital expenditures principally support, enhance, and protect Northern Trust’s\ninvestment management, asset servicing and wealth management systems and capabilities, with focus on delivering secure,\nhighly available and innovative solutions to better serve our clients. Additional capital expenditures committed for\ntechnology platforms will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. Software\namortization and depreciation on computer hardware are charged to Equipment and Software expense. Depreciation on\nbuilding and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to Occupancy expense and equipment expense,\nrespectively. Capital expenditures for 2022 totaled $723.5 million, of which $594.9 million was for software, $84.0 million\nwas for computer hardware, $35.5 million was for building and leasehold improvements, and $9.1 million was for\nfurnishings.\nDeposits\nThe following table provides the scheduled maturity of total time deposits in denominations of $250,000 or greater at\nDecember 31, 2023.

These deposit amounts are derived by adding estimated U.S. office uninsured deposits as allowed by Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council instructions to all non-U.S. office deposits. Estimated uninsured U.S. office\ndeposits are determined by calculating and totaling the deposits in excess of the deposit insurance limit on an individual\naccount basis.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as\ncollateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To\nminimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is\nmonitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly\nassessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities\npurchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged\nto the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under agreements to repurchase against those\npurchased under agreements to resell when the requirements to net are met. See Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent\nLiabilities,” Note 26, “Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase,” and Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” for additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 67\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeographic Area Information\nNorthern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash\nmanagement, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment\nbasis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source assets. Non-U.S. source assets are not separately identified\nin Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S.\nactivities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it\nis difficult to segregate with precision assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective\nestimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nThe following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to non-U.S. operations (based on the\nobligor’s domicile) and the percent of those balances to total consolidated average assets. For additional information refer\nto Note 31, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData.”\nTABLE 40: SELECTED AVERAGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-U.S. OPERATIONS\n(In Millions) 2023 2022\nTotal Assets $ 24,927.8 $ 26,904.3\nTime Deposits with Banks 1,847.7 2,082.2\nLoans 2,349.5 2,562.7\nNon-U.S. Investments 14,565.0 16,002.1\nTotal Liabilities 67,964.2 77,481.6\nDeposits 66,232.9 75,808.6\nNon-U.S. Outstandings\nAs used in this discussion, non-U.S. outstandings are cross-border outstandings as defined by the SEC. They consist of\nloans, securities, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, accrued interest and other monetary assets. Not\nincluded are letters of credit, loan commitments, and non-U.S. office local currency claims on residents. Non-U.S.\noutstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of\ntangible, liquid collateral realizable outside the country. However, transactions with branches of non-U.S. banks are\nincluded in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the non-U.S. bank’s head office.\nShort-term interbank time deposits with non-U.S. banks represent the largest category of non-U.S. outstandings.\nNorthern Trust actively participates in the interbank market with U.S. and non-U.S. banks.\nNorthern Trust places deposits with non-U.S. counterparties that have strong internal (Northern Trust) risk ratings and\nexternal credit ratings. These non-U.S. banks are approved and monitored by Northern Trust’s Capital Markets Credit\nCommittee, which has credit authority for exposure to all non-U.S. banks and approves credit limits. This process includes\nfinancial analysis of the non-U.S. banks, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market\nindicators. Each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or\ngeneral market conditions. Separate from the entity-specific review process, the average life to maturity of deposits with\nnon-U.S. banks is deliberately maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions.\nNorthern Trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of\ncollateral and/or balance sheet netting. Additionally, the Capital Markets Credit Committee oversees country-risk analyses\nand imposes limits on country exposure.

The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of savings,\nmoney market and other interest-bearing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities of $26.4 billion primarily reflected\ndecreased levels of total deposits, partially offset by higher short-term other borrowings, proceeds from the issuance of\n4.00% senior notes and 6.125% subordinated notes, and higher federal funds purchased. The decrease in total deposits was\nprimarily attributable to lower levels of non-U.S. office noninterest-bearing deposits, non-U.S. office interest-bearing\ndeposits, and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits.\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOne of Northern Trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients,\ncounterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position helps Northern Trust execute its strategies\nand withstand unforeseen adverse developments.\nSenior management, with oversight from the Capital Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and the full\nBoard of Directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. Northern Trust manages its capital on both a total\nCorporation basis and a legal entity basis. The Capital Committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital\nmetrics against levels set forth within the Capital Policy approved by the Capital Governance Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. In establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the\nunique risk profiles of Northern Trust’s businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, economic and\nmarket forecasts, and the impact on credit ratings.\nCapital levels increased in 2023 as average stockholders’ equity increased $415.4 million, or 4%, to $11.5 billion.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $11.9 billion at December 31, 2023, as compared to $11.3 billion at December 31, 2022.\nPreferred dividends totaling $41.8 million were declared in 2023. During 2023, the Corporation maintained its quarterly\ncommon stock dividend at $0.75 per common share. Common dividends totaling $630.2 million were declared in 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation repurchased 4,384,678 shares of common stock, including\n378,130 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at an average price per share of $79.26.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 69\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn accordance with Basel III requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced\napproaches. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the lower of each capital ratio calculated under the standardized approach\nand the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. The following table\nprovides a reconciliation of the Corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based\ncapital ratios, under the applicable U.S. regulatory rules as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 42: CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n($ In Millions) DECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nSTANDARDIZED ADVANCED STANDARDIZED ADVANCED\nAPPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nCommon Stockholders’ Equity $ 11,013.1 $ 11,013.1 $ 10,374.6 $ 10,374.6\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net of Deferred Tax Liability (722.2) (722.2) (719.7) (719.7)\nOther (111.5) (111.5) (115.2) (115.2)\nTotal Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 10,179.4 10,179.4 9,539.7 9,539.7\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital\nPreferred Stock 884.9 884.9 884.9 884.9\nOther (40.4) (40.4) (27.2) (27.2)\nTotal Additional Tier 1 Capital 844.5 844.5 857.7 857.7\nTotal Tier 1 Capital 11,023.9 11,023.9 10,397.4 10,397.4\nTier 2 Capital\nQualifying Allowance for Credit Losses 219.2 — 199.6 —\nQualifying Subordinated Debt 1,490.8 1,490.8 1,648.5 1,648.5\nTotal Tier 2 Capital 1,710.0 1,490.8 1,848.1 1,648.5\nTotal Risk-Based Capital $ 12,733.9 $ 12,514.7 $ 12,245.5 $ 12,045.9\nRisk-Weighted Assets(1) $ 89,527.4 $ 75,980.0 $ 88,107.7 $ 83,181.2\nTotal Assets – End of Period (EOP) 150,783.1 150,783.1 155,036.7 155,036.7\nAdjusted Average Fourth Quarter Assets(2) 135,701.9 135,701.9 146,883.8 146,883.8\nTotal Loans – EOP 47,617.0 47,617.0 42,893.3 42,893.3\nCommon Stockholders’ Equity to:\nTotal Loans – EOP 23.13 % 23.13 % 24.19 % 24.19 %\nTotal Assets – EOP 7.30 7.30 6.69 6.69\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital 11.4 % 13.4 % 10.8 % 11.5 %\nTier 1 Capital 12.3 14.5 11.8 12.5\nTotal Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 14.2 16.5 13.9 14.5\nTier 1 Leverage 8.1 8.1 7.1 7.1\nSupplementary Leverage N/A 8.6 N/A 7.9\n(1) Risk-weighted assets exclude, as applicable under each regulatory approach, amounts primarily related to goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains\nor losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, if any.\n(2) Adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the requirements for classification as\n“well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements.\nNorthern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to\nregulatory capital standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities\nwith regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that\ndeducts any unrealized losses related to AFS securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and\nsupervisory stress testing in the form of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercises, which confirms\nour ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions.\nThe results of the 2023 DFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 28, 2023, resulted in Northern\nTrust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at\n2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2023 and continues through\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n70 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued the Basel III Endgame Proposal, which would change how risk-\nbased capital requirements are determined for banking organizations including Northern Trust. The proposal would\neliminate the existing advanced approach methodologies for determining RWAs and replace it with a new expanded risk\nbased approach. The new requirements would be phased in over a three year period beginning July 1, 2025. Based on our\ncurrent understanding of the proposed rule, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had applied on a fully\nphased-in basis as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded\nrisk-based approach RWAs as of that date would have been approximately 5% to 15% higher than our actual standardized\napproach RWAs as of that date.\nFurther information regarding the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for\nclassification as “well-capitalized” is provided in the “Supervision and Regulation—Capital Adequacy Requirements”\nsection of Item 1, “Business,” and Note 32, “Regulatory Capital Requirements,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data.”\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” provided in\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC\nhas issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that\nrequire management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and\nmay change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas\ncould have a material impact on Northern Trust’s future financial condition and results of operations.\nFor Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses\nand pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting\nestimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses—which represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to\nvarious portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is\ndetermined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of\nfinancial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. The allowance for a financial asset that does not share\nsimilar risk characteristics with other financial assets is determined through an individual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of Allowance for Credit Losses are not dependent\non any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many\nof which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other\nestimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2023 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur\nfrom period to period.\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses consists of the following components:\nAllowance Evaluated on a Collective Basis. Expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the\nfinancial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. If financial assets are deemed not to share\nsimilar risk characteristics, an individual assessment is warranted.\nThe allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the\nCorporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and\nrecessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan\nportfolio into segments based on loan and obligor-specific factors, including loan type, borrower type, collateral type, loan\nsize, and borrower credit quality. For each segment, the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each\nquarter of the remaining life of each instrument. For the first two years (the reasonable and supportable period), these\nfactors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on\nmacroeconomic factors and loans with similar characteristics. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period,\nNorthern Trust reverts to its long-run historical loss experiences on a straight-line basis over four quarters. The projected\nexposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end, with adjustments\nmade for potential draws on off-balance sheet commitments.\nNorthern Trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit\nallowance on a collective basis. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the\nexposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance. The quantitative\nallowance is then reviewed within a qualitative adjustment framework, through which management applies judgment by\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 71\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nassessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and environmental factors that are not\nfully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment and class of the\nloan portfolio.\nASC 326-20-30 requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors. The Corporation uses multiple forecasts\napproved by Northern Trust’s Macroeconomic Scenario Development Committee (MSDC). The baseline forecast aligns\nwith the Corporation’s latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters. An alternative scenario is\nalso considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles.\nThe forecasts are probability-weighted at each evaluation period and are management’s best estimate of future economic\nprojections at that time.\nThe allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition, portfolio quality, and macroeconomic\nforecasts. Increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will\nincrease the reserve, all else equal. Similarly, deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the\nreserve. Macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to Northern Trust’s loan portfolio are equity market values,\nmarket volatility, corporate profits, residential and commercial real estate price indices, unemployment, and disposable\nincome. To demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions, Northern Trust applied a 100%\nprobability weighting to downturn conditions, resulting in an increase to the collective component of the allowance for the\nloan portfolio of approximately $121.2 million. The investment security and other financial assets portfolios are less\nsensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality, short\nduration, and low historical losses.\nThe commercial and institutional (C&I) portfolio utilizes Northern Trust’s internal borrower rating assessments to\ndetermine initial credit quality. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of upgrades or downgrades by\nshifting the rating up or down by one rating class, assuming no changes to other factors, such as macroeconomic\nprojections or qualitative adjustments. The analysis excludes defaulted loans and does not assume a default event; hence,\nborrowers at the lowest non-default rating were not downgraded. Similarly, those at the highest rating could not be\nupgraded. Assuming the final forecast probability weighting, the collective component of the allowance assigned to the\nC&I portfolio would increase by approximately $82.3 million if all C&I borrowers were downgraded by one performing\nrating class. The C&I collective allowance would decrease by approximately $32.4 million if borrower ratings were\nupgraded by one rating class (if possible).\nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss\nReserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic\nResearch Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. The Credit Loss Reserve Committee\ndetermines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by MSDC, and also reviews and approves qualitative\nadjustments to the collective allowance in line with Northern Trust’s qualitative adjustment framework.\nAllowance Evaluated on an Individual Basis. The individual allowance is determined through individual evaluations\nof financial assets that have defaulted, based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that\nmay impact the borrowers’ ability to pay. For defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined\nbased on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by\nmanagement. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect\nmanagement’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.\nAnalysis and Controls. The quarterly analysis of the individual and collective allowance components and the control\nprocess maintained by Financial Risk Management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by\nmanagement for the timely identification and estimation of individual expected credit losses. In addition to Northern\nTrust’s own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. Control processes and analyses employed to\ndetermine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed at least annually and modified as considered\nappropriate.\nManagement believes that the Allowance for Credit Losses adequately considers these uncertainties and has been\nestablished at an appropriate level. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for\ncredit losses may be greater or less than actual net charge-offs in any particular period.\n72 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPension Plan Accounting\nNorthern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (U.S.\nQualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (U.S. Non-Qualified Plan). Certain European-based\nemployees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees\nand to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires\nthe use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and\nother actuarial-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that\nare required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected benefit\nobligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance\nrequires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the\nperiod in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income over the average remaining service period of eligible participants. As a result, differences between\nthe estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation and actual\nexperience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense\nsystematically and gradually over subsequent periods.\nNorthern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of\nthe pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions\neach year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension\nplans’ actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed\nincome securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that\nmay impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nIn determining the pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Plan and for the U.S. Non-Qualified Plan in 2023, Northern\nTrust utilized a discount rate of 5.22% and 5.15% as of December 31, 2022, respectively. For both plans, the rate of\nincrease in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 5.56%. The expected\nlong-term rate of return on U.S. Qualified Plan assets was 7.25% as of December 31, 2022.\nIn evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the U.S. pension plans as of Northern Trust’s\nDecember 31, 2023 measurement date, the following were considered:\n• Discount Rate: Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the plan specific\nprojected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the Aon AA Above Median yield curve as of the\nmeasurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods\nover a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable\nmarket yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the\ndiscount rate resulted in a rate of 5.03% and 4.95% at December 31, 2023 for the U.S. Qualified and U.S. Non-\nQualified Plans, respectively.\n• Compensation Level: Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale\nassumption is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 5.56%.\n• Rate of Return on Plan Assets: The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years)\nrate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix\nand estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and\nrebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital\nmarket assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and\nappropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust’s rate of return assumption for the U.S. Qualified Plan\nwill continue to be 7.25% for 2024.\n• Mortality Table: Northern Trust had adopted the aggregate Pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year, which was\nreleased by the Society of Actuaries in October 2019. Northern Trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future\nimprovement under scale MP-2021, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2021. As was the case\nin 2022, no change to these assumptions was made in 2023 since the Society of Actuaries did not release any updates\nto its mortality tables and improvement scales in 2023. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static\nand continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2024.\nThe net pension expense in 2024 is expected to slightly increase, primarily driven by higher amortization of prior year’s\nasset losses, offset by the positive effects of the cash contribution made to the U.S. Qualified Plan at the beginning of 2024.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 73\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S pension plans’ 2024 periodic pension expense\nand the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023, the following table is presented to show the effect of\nincreasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.\nTABLE 43: SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSUMPTIONS\n25 BASIS 25 BASIS\n(In Millions) POINT INCREASE POINT DECREASE\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2024 Pension Expense\nDiscount Rate Change $ (2.9) $ 3.0\nCompensation Level Change 2.3 (2.3)\nRate of Return on Plan Assets Change (4.0) 4.0\nIncrease (Decrease) in December 31, 2023 Projected Benefit Obligation\nDiscount Rate Change (32.7) 34.3\nCompensation Level Change 9.1 (8.9)\nPension Contributions. The deduction limits specified by the Internal Revenue Code for contributions made by sponsors\nof defined benefit pension plans are based on a “Target Liability” under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of\n2006. There were no contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan for the 2023 plan year. $200.0 million was contributed to the\nU.S. Qualified Plan for the 2024 plan year at the beginning of 2024.\nThe minimum required contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan is expected to be zero in 2024. The remaining 2024\nmaximum deductible contribution, after considering the cash contribution of $200.0 million, is estimated at $220.0 million.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nIn March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\n2023-02, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method—a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2023-02).\nThe amendments in ASU 2023-02 permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless\nof the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if\ncertain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the\ninvestment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net\namortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax\nexpense (benefit). In addition, ASU 2023-02 requires specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that\ngenerate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program for which the entity has elected to\napply the proportional amortization method in accordance with Subtopic 323-740. ASU 2023-02 is effective for interim\nand annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Northern Trust adopted ASU 2023-02 as of January 1, 2024 using\nthe modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2023-02 is not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust’s\nconsolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 significantly expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable\nsegments, primarily through more frequent and enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07\ndoes not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments or applies the\nquantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-07 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance\nsheets or consolidated statements of income.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic\n350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets” (ASU 2023-08). ASU 2023-08 requires entities to subsequently\nmeasure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. In\naddition, ASU 2023-08 requires the presentation of crypto assets separately from other intangible assets on the face of the\nbalance sheet and changes in fair value of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amount of other intangible\nassets on the statement of income. ASU 2023-08 also requires enhanced disclosures about in-scope crypto assets and\nrespective activities. ASU 2023-08 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although\n74 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nearly adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2023-08 is not expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s\nconsolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures” (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax\ndisclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU\n2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is\nnot expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk Management Overview\nNorthern Trust employs an integrated risk management framework to enable a risk informed profile and support its\nbusiness decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify,\nmanage, report and govern both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and\ngood conduct across the organization. Northern Trust’s risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and\nconduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization.\nNorthern Trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management\naccountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to\nreinforce this culture.\nNorthern Trust’s risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent\nenterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk\ncategories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. The risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by\nNorthern Trust. The risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk\ninventory and enabling different risk profile views. All identified risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business activities are\ncataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, liquidity, market, and strategic risk.\nAll material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common\ncharacteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.\nNorthern Trust implements its risk management framework through a “three lines of defense” operating model,\nembedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management\nexpectations across the organization, contains three roles, each with a complementary level of risk management\naccountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it\nagainst the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk\nManagement function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for Northern Trust’s risk management activities and\nprovides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense,\nprovides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.\nRisk Governance and Oversight Overview\nRisk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined\naccountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The\nfollowing diagram provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust’s risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by\nthe Board of Directors and key risk-related committees.\nTABLE 44: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\nNorthern Trust Corporation Board of Directors\nBusiness Risk Committee\nHuman Capital and Compensation\nAudit Committee – Cybersecurity Risk Capital Governance Committee Committee\nOversight Subcommittee\nGlobal Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC)\nMarket & Compliance & Information Model Risk\nCredit Risk Operational Risk Fiduciary Risk Workforce Risk\nLiquidity Risk Ethics Oversight Technology Risk Oversight\nCommittee Committee Committee Committee\nCommittee Committee Committee Committee\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit\nCommittee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Human Capital and Compensation\nCommittee.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 75\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Board of Directors annually approves Northern Trust’s Risk Management Framework and Corporate Risk Appetite\nStatement.\nThe Audit Committee provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk.\nThe Business Risk Committee assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to the credit risk, operational\nrisk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, and associated risk themes. The\nCybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee is a subcommittee of the Business Risk Committee and assists the\nBusiness Risk Committee in discharging its duties with respect to risks related to cybersecurity inherent in Northern\nTrust’s businesses.\nThe Human Capital and Compensation Committee oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust’s\nincentive compensation program. The Committee annually reviews management’s assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe design and performance of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing\nincentives that are consistent with Northern Trust’s safety, soundness, and culture. This assessment includes an\nevaluation of whether Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate\nrisk-taking behavior by participants.\nThe Capital Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in discharging its oversight duties with respect to\ncapital management and resolution planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance\nCommittee oversees Northern Trust’s capital management assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and\nactivities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of\nsuch processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to\nNorthern Trust’s linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust’s management of risk and compliance, promotes risk\nawareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are\nidentified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee\nand the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the\nCommittee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the\nrisk management framework, the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, Head of Financial Risk, Head\nof Non-Financial Risk, Head of Strategic Risk, Chief Fiduciary Risk Officer, International Chief Risk Officer, Chief\nExecutive Officer, President—Asset Management, President—Asset Servicing, President—Wealth Management, Chief\nFinancial Officer and Chief Information Officer, meet as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide\nexecutive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk and risk themes\nwithin Northern Trust. The Chief Audit Executive, or such officer’s designee, and the General Counsel, or such officer’s\ndesignee, shall be invited to attend each GERC meeting as a non-voting member. All other members of the executive\nmanagement team of the Corporation will also be standing invitees. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC\nreceives reports, escalations, or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of\nrisk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include:\nThe Credit Risk Committee (CRC) establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern\nTrust and promotes their uniform application.\nThe Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) oversees activities relating to the management of market and\nliquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge\nof related policies, key assumptions, and practices.\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC) provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the operational\nrisk-related policies and developing and implementing the operational risk management framework and programs that\nsupport coordination of operational risk activities.\nThe Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC) is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and\nestablishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk\nactivities.\n76 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC) provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance\npolicies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance\ninitiatives across the Corporation.\nThe Information Technology Risk Committee (ITRC) provides oversight and direction with respect to information\nsecurity, technology and cyber risk. The committee is responsible for recommending the policies related to, and\noverseeing development and implementation of the risk management framework, standards and processes supporting\ncoordination and governance of, information security, technology and cyber risk management activities.\nThe Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC) is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and\noversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust.\nThe Workforce Risk Committee (WRC) is responsible for assessing workforce risk and monitoring initiatives associated\nwith workforce risk management.\nIn addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust establishes business and regional risk committees that also\nreport into GERC.\nRisk Assessment, Appetite and Reporting Processes\nAs part of the integrated risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management\nprocesses, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the\nexecution of its corporate strategies. Northern Trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the\nfirst and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.\nNorthern Trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement are willing to assume to achieve the Corporation’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with\nprudent management of risk and applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. It includes consideration\nof the likelihood and impact of risks, using both monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor\nagainst tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to risk committees, senior management, and the\nBoard of Directors or committees thereof, as appropriate.\nRisk Control\nRisk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed\nby the Head of Risk Control and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, and Global Compliance Testing\ngroups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and\nmanagement of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-\nvalidating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related\ncredit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Lastly, Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of\nprocedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust\npolicies governing regulatory compliance activities. The Business Risk Committee has oversight responsibility with respect\nto Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups.\nAudit Services\nAudit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust’s risk\nmanagement framework. Audit Services is managed by the Chief Audit Executive with oversight from the Audit\nCommittee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with\nthe framework on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services\nincludes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The Chief\nAudit Executive reports directly to the Audit Committee and administratively reports to the Corporation’s Chief Executive\nOfficer and is a non-voting member of GERC.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower, issuer, or counterparty to perform on an\nobligation.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 77\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Overview\nCredit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust’s activities. The bulk of credit risk relates to loans, securities, and\nwholesale counterparty-related exposures, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing activities.\nNorthern Trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern\nTrust is generally:\n• not an originator of loan products intended to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset\nsecuritizations;\n• not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of\nparticipations; and\n• not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, hedge fund leveraging, loans to private\nequity sponsored companies, or prime brokerage activities.\nCredit Risk Framework and Governance\nThe CRC is the most senior credit committee at Northern Trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and\nmonitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the Bank. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO,\nchairs the CRC, and heads the Credit Risk Management function at Northern Trust.\nThe Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the\nbusiness units that manage client relationships, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive\nmanagement of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a\nframework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent credit culture and monitors\nadherence to those internal policies, standards, and programs, as well as external regulations. Independent oversight and\nreview of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control.\nThe credit risk framework stipulates authority levels for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority\nfor commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding policies or\nstandards because of amount, maturity, rating, or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval\nCommittee. Credit decisions involving requests in excess of Group Credit Approval Committee limits require the approval\nof the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole authority for the approval, modification,\nor renewal of credit exposure limits to all wholesale market counterparties. The Senior Credit Committee and Capital\nMarkets Credit Committee are both direct sub-committees of the CRC. The Treasury Credit Committee provides similar\napproval for investments in assets subject to credit risk, such as bonds and equities.\nCredit Risk Measurement\nThe credit risk framework covers a number of different measurements of credit risk at Northern Trust, including RWA, the\nallowance for credit losses, and stress tests using various macroeconomic scenarios, such as the internal capital adequacy\napproval program and CCAR.\nAn integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system. Northern Trust’s\ninternal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of the Corporation’s credit risk.\nCalculations include entity-specific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default (PD) and\nexposure-specific information about loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and maturity. Northern Trust’s\ninternal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any direct linkage to external credit ratings.\nObligors are assigned PDs after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Although the criteria vary,\nthe objective is for assigned PDs to be consistent in the measurement and ranking of risk. LGD and EAD are assigned\nbased on obligor, product, collateral and instrument characteristics.\nRisk ratings are assigned at the time a counterparty or an obligation is approved, renewed, or amended. Risk ratings\nare reviewed annually or when new information relevant to the rating is received. Risk ratings are utilized for credit\nunderwriting, management reporting, and the calculation of regulatory capital.\nThe Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal\nrisk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control.\nLoans and Other Extensions of Credit\nA significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding\ncommitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and\narrangements are discussed in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data.”\nUndrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a\nsignificant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the\nindustry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n78 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 45: UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nCOMMITMENTS COMMITMENTS\nONE YEAR OVER ONE OUTSTANDING ONE YEAR OVER ONE OUTSTANDING\n(In Millions) TOTAL AND LESS YEAR LOANS TOTAL AND LESS YEAR LOANS\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional\nFinance and Insurance $ 3,536.8 $ 1,664.0 $ 1,872.8 $ 1,109.3 $ 3,394.7 $ 1,598.0 $ 1,796.7 $ 953.8\nHolding Companies — — — 28.9 — — — 45.0\nManufacturing 6,551.9 1,104.3 5,447.6 1,619.1 6,063.3 764.2 5,299.1 1,855.0\nMining 461.8 29.8 432.0 29.8 499.0 36.8 462.2 60.7\nPrivate Equity 2,740.4 1,888.9 851.5 3,248.9 3,300.1 2,383.3 916.8 4,091.1\nPublic Administration 50.0 50.0 — 28.1 50.0 50.0 — 13.3\nRetail Trade 1,003.8 382.2 621.6 244.2 1,158.2 369.0 789.2 203.7\nServices 6,133.1 2,528.1 3,605.0 4,041.7 5,860.6 2,357.7 3,502.9 4,099.0\nTransportation and\nWarehousing 239.9 3.7 236.2 273.2 243.9 — 243.9 251.8\nUtilities 1,246.3 8.5 1,237.8 36.8 1,220.7 67.7 1,153.0 8.6\nWholesale Trade 759.2 60.0 699.2 510.4 741.4 118.8 622.6 484.7\nOther Commercial 159.7 49.5 110.2 384.9 147.5 89.4 58.1 348.3\nCommercial and Institutional(1) 22,882.9 7,769.0 15,113.9 11,555.3 22,679.4 7,834.9 14,844.5 12,415.0\nCommercial Real Estate 413.0 58.3 354.7 5,134.2 449.3 124.4 324.9 4,773.0\nNon-U.S.\nOther Non-US 1,340.4 677.7 662.7 1,543.0 1,562.4 1,046.0 516.4 1,627.9\nPrivate Equity 446.2 446.2 — 1,235.5 575.2 526.5 48.7 1,503.2\nNon-U.S. 1,786.6 1,123.9 662.7 2,778.5 2,137.6 1,572.5 565.1 3,131.1\nOther 87.5 87.5 — 5,944.8 91.4 91.4 — 1,316.5\nTotal Commercial 25,170.0 9,038.7 16,131.3 25,412.8 25,357.7 9,623.2 15,734.5 21,635.6\nPersonal\nPrivate Client 3,876.2 2,033.6 1,842.6 14,360.0 3,970.0 3,090.4 879.6 14,119.0\nResidential Real Estate 804.2 251.3 552.9 6,327.1 783.4 125.6 657.8 6,413.5\nNon-U.S. 908.7 525.9 382.8 428.8 849.5 800.0 49.5 510.0\nOther — — — 1,088.3 — — — 215.2\nTotal Personal 5,589.1 2,810.8 2,778.3 22,204.2 5,602.9 4,016.0 1,586.9 21,257.7\nTotal $ 30,759.1 $ 11,849.5 $ 18,909.6 $ 47,617.0 $ 30,960.6 $ 13,639.2 $ 17,321.4 $ 42,893.3\n(1) The commercial and institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\nAs part of Northern Trust’s credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio\nreviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in\nan effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of\npast due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonaccrual status or charged\noff. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio “watch list” for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all\nnonaccrual credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management\nfunction, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of management’s\nimplementation of Credit Risk Management’s requirements.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related\nactivities, including trading OTC foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, indemnified securities lending transactions,\nand sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a\nframework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.\nTo calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, indemnified\nsecurities lending, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign\nexchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 79\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nmethodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk\nmitigants, is determined based on regulatory requirements.\nCredit Risk Mitigation\nNorthern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However,\nNorthern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash\nflow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the\nfollowing three primary categories.\nPhysical and Financial Collateral: One of Northern Trust’s primary credit risk mitigation approaches is the\nrequirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined\nmortgages on the property. Various other types of physical and financial collateral are also accepted for certain\ncommercial and personal loans, in line with Northern Trust’s lending standards. In cases where loans to clients are\nsecured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to\ncollateral coverage policies.\nNetting: On-balance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting arrangements.\nNetting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to\neligible master netting arrangements.\nGuarantees: Personal and corporate guarantees are accepted, as warranted, to reduce risk of default, facilitate\npotential collection efforts, and protect Northern Trust’s claims relative to other creditors.\nAnother important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single\n(or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in\nplace to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from\nexternal events.\nOperational Risk Overview\nOperational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for\ninadequate information systems, operating problems, challenges related to reliance on third parties, product design and\ndelivery difficulties, potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses. This includes the potential that continuity of\nservice and resilience may be impacted.\nOperational risk includes information technology and cybersecurity, compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the\nCorporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.\nOperational Risk Framework and Governance\nTo monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies,\nprograms and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation’s operational\nrisk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework implements a structured approach to\nestablishing and communicating operational risk management practices and responsibilities. This structured approach to\nmeasuring and managing operational risk addresses operational resilience which requires that Northern Trust minimize\nservice disruptions and limit systemic impacts from adverse events as well as risk quantification. The framework is\ndeployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that\ninfluence risk and drive action to maintain operational resilience and reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk\nManagement function operates within the independent Non-Financial Risk function and is responsible for defining the\noperational risk management framework and providing independent oversight of the framework implementation and\napplication across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk\nframework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on\noperational risk and mitigate Northern Trust’s exposure to service disruptions and loss. Several key programs support the\noperational risk framework, including:\n• Loss Event Data Program - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational\nrisk exposure, various business analyses and the Basel Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) capital\nquantification. Both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification. Thresholds\n80 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ndrive analysis, action and escalation through Northern Trust’s businesses and the Operational Risk Management\nfunction.\n• Risk and Control Self-Assessment - a comprehensive, structured risk management process used by Northern Trust’s\nbusinesses to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational risk exposures throughout the enterprise.\n• Operational Risk Scenario Analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and\nrisk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact\nof plausible operational losses.\n• Product and Process Risk Management Program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with\nthe introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services and with significant changes to operating\nprocesses.\n• Operational Resilience - a program designed to ensure the resilience and continuity of service delivery of Northern\nTrust’s most important business services.\n• Third-Party Risk Management Program - a program that provides processes for evaluating, quantifying and\nqualifying appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of third and fourth parties\n(inclusive of external and internal, e.g., Northern Trust legal entity to legal entity relationships).\n• Global Fraud Risk - a program designed to prevent, detect and respond to attempted or actual fraud impacting the\nbank and its clients globally.\n• Data Management - a program that embeds data management and data governance related activities into Northern\nTrust processes in order to manage data risk.\n• Data Privacy Program - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to compliance with all applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations relating to privacy and establishes overarching principles for the responsible use and protection\nof confidential information.\n• Cyber and Technology Risk Management - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to communicate\nrisk management processes and controls addressing cybersecurity (inclusive of information security), technology, and\nrelated compliance risks to the organization. Please see Item 1C, “Cybersecurity,” for a detailed discussion of\ncybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.\n• Business Continuity Management Program - a program designed to protect life safety, minimize and manage the\nbusiness impact and support the recovery of critical functions for clients following an incident.\n• Physical Security - a program that provides for the life safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors\nworldwide by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, establishing partnerships, and encouraging continual\nimprovement in workplace security.\n• Insurance Management Program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss\nevents through the securing of appropriate insurance policy protection.\nAs discussed in “Risk Control” above, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework.\nThe ORC is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk\nincluding establishing and maintaining the Corporate Operational Risk Management Policy and approving the operational\nrisk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to\ninformation technology, cybersecurity, compliance and fiduciary risks. The purpose of this committee is to provide\nexecutive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks. This includes\nidentification and assessment of evolving risk trends across the operational risk framework and how these can be best\nmanaged.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nNorthern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and\napplicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust’s AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the\nLoss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required\ncapital. While internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification, external loss event data and qualitative risk\nand control self-assessments are also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital\nquantification process. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital\nquantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to\narrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year\ntime horizon.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 81\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperational Resilience and Recovery Management\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience approach encompasses operational resilience and recovery processes enterprise-\nwide (including staff, technology and facilities) to anticipate and limit disruptions and to ensure that following a disaster or\nbusiness interruption Northern Trust is able to resume critical business functions and fulfill all regulatory and legal\nrequirements.\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security,\nresilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network\nsecurity, resilience centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that\nprovide further capability.\nAll of Northern Trust’s businesses are required to risk-assess all of their functions regularly and develop business\ncontinuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for\nobtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The\nbusiness continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of\nNorthern Trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually. The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate\nbusiness continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee.\nFiduciary Risk\nFiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure: (a) in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’\nfiduciary accounts; (b) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or\napplicable laws; or (c) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular\nfunction being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship, and governing document.\nFiduciary Risk Overview\nThe fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors, and reports on fiduciary risk matters\ndeemed significant. Fiduciary risk is best managed at the source of the risk, and is mitigated through internal controls and\nrisk management practices that are designed to identify, understand, and keep such risk at levels consistent with the\norganization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each client relationship for which Northern\nTrust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external\nregulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards, and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired\nrisk appetite.\nFiduciary Risk Framework and Governance\nThe FRC is responsible for overseeing activities related to the exercise of fiduciary powers throughout the organization,\nand for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and the fiduciary risk framework that supports the\ncoordination of activities to identify, monitor, manage, and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an\nescalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to\ncomply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-\nregulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:\n• Regulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory\nrequirements.\n• Financial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider\ndealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated\nwith the same.\n82 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompliance Risk Framework and Governance\nThe compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance\nrisk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory\nviolations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics\nProgram approved by the Business Risk Committee.\nEach business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and\nspecific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees’\ncompliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and\nguidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program.\nThe Compliance and Ethics Oversight Committee (“CEOC”) oversees and provides direction with respect to the\nimplementation of Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program and the coordination of compliance initiatives across\nthe enterprise. The CEOC approves policies necessary to effectively manage Regulatory and Financial Crime Risk. The\nChief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee, as appropriate, and chairs the CEOC.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity Risk Overview\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and\ncontingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust\nis a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory\nliquidity standards as U.S. GSIBs. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and\nactivities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio calculations to regulators.\nNorthern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is\nprimarily liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits,\nwhich are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits and can also be\ninfluenced by market conditions. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model,\nwhere increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of\nlending. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated\nobligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.\nLiquidity Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk\nprofile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk\nManagement function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Liquidity Management Policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board of Directors, and\ncommittee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations\nand established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the LCR, the NSFR, and the liquidity stress-\ntesting buffer across a range of time horizons. Treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management\nstrategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities. The Asset and Liability Management\nCommittee (ALCO) provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities\nwithin the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash\nflows, LCR, NSFR, and stress test results.\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities,\nevaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective\naction. The Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing\nmarket and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and\nassumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 83\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nLiquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity\nanalysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to understand better the nature and sources of its\nliquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management,\ncash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and\ncontingency funding planning.\nThe liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern\nTrust’s Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports that enable oversight\nbodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic\nliquidity metrics such as LCR, NSFR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other\nmetrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.\nRegulatory Environment\nNorthern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework\nagainst proposed rule-making and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further\nenhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business,” for\na discussion of applicable liquidity standards.\nU.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\nThe LCR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows\nover a 30 calendar-day standardized supervisory liquid stress scenario. The requirements of the LCR Final Rule are\nintended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the\nbanking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and\nmanagement of liquidity risk. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements\nduring 2023.\nU.S. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nThe NSFR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of\navailable stable funding (ASF) equal to or greater than the banking organization’s projected minimum funding needs, or\nrequired stable funding (RSF), over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR is designed to reduce the likelihood that\ndisruptions to a banking organization’s regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective\nliquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to\nbusinesses and households across a range of market conditions. The NSFR supports financial stability by requiring banking\norganizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that\nfunding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. The Corporation and the Bank\neach satisfied the NSFR requirements during 2023.\nFunding\nNorthern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and\nother central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 59% and 63% of\ntotal assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank,\nwhich include those placed at the central bank discount window, totaled $39.0 billion and $46.2 billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs the Corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust’s banking activities, the Bank centrally\nmanages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including\nclient deposits (institutional and personal) from the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale\nfunding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, interest earned on investment securities and money\nmarket assets, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure\nadditional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had over $34.7 billion and $39.0 billion, respectively of securities and loans\nreadily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank\nfunding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds.\nThe liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the\nCorporation are issuances of debt or equity and dividend payments from the Bank. For further information on issuances or\nredemptions of debt or equity, please refer to Note 12, “Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt” provided in Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data.” The Corporation received $850.0 million of dividends and no dividends from the\n84 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBank in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further\ndetail in Note 30, “Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances,” provided in Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data.”\nThe Corporation’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $795.6 million and\n$601.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During, and at year-end, 2023 and 2022, these assets were\ncomprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of\nwhich were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as\nneeded. Average liquidity during 2023 and 2022 was $797.2 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The cash flows of the\nCorporation are shown in Note 33, “Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only),” provided in Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data.”\nUses of Liquidity\nLiquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws\non commitments to extend credit.\nThe Corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation’s stockholders; the payment of\nprincipal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The\nmost significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2023 were $621.5 million of common stock dividends and $347.5\nmillion of common stock repurchases. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2022 were $750.2\nmillion of common stock dividends and $35.4 million of common stock repurchases.\nCredit Ratings\nA significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets\nglobally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of December 31, 2023, provided in the following table,\nallow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.\nTABLE 46: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\nCREDIT RATING\nSTANDARD &\nPOOR’S MOODY’S FITCH RATINGS\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nSenior Debt A+ A2 A+\nSubordinated Debt A A2 A+\nPreferred Stock BBB+ Baa1 BBB\nOutlook Stable Stable Stable\nThe Northern Trust Company:\nShort-Term Deposit A-1+ P-1 F1+\nLong-Term Deposit/Debt AA- Aa2 AA\nSubordinated Debt A+ A2 A+\nOutlook Stable Stable Stable\nA significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust’s access to capital markets and/or\nincrease the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these\nrate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust’s relative debt\nrating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in\nNote 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”\nNorthern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related\ncontingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash\nsettlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified\nlevels. At December 31, 2023, the net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have\nbeen required to pay was $52.2 million. Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments,\nNorthern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at December 31, 2023, that would be\ntriggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 85\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPlease refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data” for information on off-balance sheet arrangements and the Credit Risk discussion in the “Risk\nManagement” section for further detail on undrawn commitments.\nMarket Risk\nThere are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk\nassociated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income\nand the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities\nportfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to\ncause changes in the value of trading positions.\nMarket Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk\nprofile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk\nManagement function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Asset and Liability Management Policy, Policy on Dealer Trading Activities, and exposure limits for market risk\nare set by Board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to\ncorporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as\nsensitivity of Net Interest Income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and value-at-risk (VaR) across a\nrange of time horizons.\nTreasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing\nmarket risk management activities. The ALCO provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving\nstrategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, overseeing the\nexecution of strategies, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, the liquidity coverage ratio and stress test results.\nThe Market and Liquidity Risk Management function, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line\nactivities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for\ncorrective action. The MLRC provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures,\nestablishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk\nmeasurement.\nInterest Rate Risk Overview\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in Northern Trust's financial position (e.g., interest\nincome, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. NII and MVE sensitivity are the primary\nmetrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or\nnegative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. Changes in\ninterest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, which directly impact the\nMVE. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of available for sale debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) that can impact regulatory capital ratios. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of\nthe balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are\nsufficiently correlated, which allows Northern Trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.\nThere are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk in the banking book:\n• repricing risk, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;\n• yield curve risk, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;\n• basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial\ninstruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and\n• embedded optionality risk, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.\n86 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nNorthern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII\nsensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity\nprovides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet.\nNorthern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation\ntechniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk\nmanagement strategies to modify interest rate risk including:\n• purchase of investment securities;\n• sale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale;\n• issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;\n• collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank; and\n• hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.\nNII Sensitivity\nThe modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments\n(principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward\ninterest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates.\nStress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e.,\ntwist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the\nyield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under\nchanging rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected\npricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The\nfollowing key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation:\n• the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities\nreplaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity\ndeposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;\n• prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using\na third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;\n• cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments\nprovided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;\n• nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management\njudgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and\n• new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.\nThe following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward\nand 100 and 200 basis point ramps downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.\nTABLE 47: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY\nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OF NET INTEREST INCOME\n(In Millions) DECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points $ 43 $ 41\n200 Basis Points 82 80\nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points $ (63) $ (31)\n200 Basis Points (150) (64)\nThe NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects\nof actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but\nserve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly\npredictive of future values of other measures provided.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 87\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMVE Sensitivity\nMVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives\nthat are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The MVE looks at the whole balance sheet, which\nincludes AFS debt securities, HTM debt securities, money market accounts, deposits, loans and wholesale borrowings. The\npotential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows\nand the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market\nrates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate\nscenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates,\nnonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the\nrelationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under\nchanging rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected\npricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. Many of\nthe assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key\nassumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation:\n• the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining\nlives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management\njudgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be\ntemporary and have comparatively shorter lives;\n• the present values of most noninterest-bearing balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as\ntheir book values; and\n• Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and 100 and 200 basis\npoint shocks down from current market implied forward rates at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Each rate movement is\nassumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.\nTABLE 48: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY\nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY\n(In Millions) DECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points $ (360) $ (472)\n200 Basis Points (817) (965)\nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points $ 430 $ 596\n200 Basis Points 725 842\nThe MVE simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual\ninterest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve\nas estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly\npredictive of future values of other measures provided.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nForeign Currency Non-Trading Risk Overview\nNorthern Trust’s balance sheet is exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S.-dollar-\ndenominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenue\nand expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities\nby currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative\ncontracts to mitigate its currency exposure.\n88 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTrading Market Risk\nWithin Market Risk, trading risk arises from providing foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, and securities brokerage\nservices to clients. Securities positions are limited and their trading risks are de minimis. For regulatory capital purposes,\ntrading risk also includes foreign currency balances from business operations.\nTrading Book Composition and Risk Drivers\nNorthern Trust’s trading book is composed of positions arising from activity in four business areas: Global Foreign\nExchange (GFX), which includes Treasury foreign exchange trades; Interest rate derivative (IRD) trades; Northern Trust\nSecurities Inc. (NTSI) inventory; and foreign currency balances (FCBs) accrued on the balance sheet.\nGFX desks execute foreign exchange transactions for client accommodation purposes and mitigate most of the\nexposure via offsetting trades. In addition, Northern Trust’s Treasury department executes foreign exchange transactions to\nmanage balance sheet flows. The risk system includes these within GFX and applies FX and interest rate (IR) drivers to\nproduce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNorthern Trust’s Treasury Department executes IRD trades for client accommodation purposes and mitigates the\nexposure via offsetting trades. The risk system applies IR and volatility drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nFCBs arise not from executing trades but rather in the course of regular business operations, from non-U.S.-dollar-\ndenominated revenues and expenses accruing onto the Corporation’s balance sheet. Prior to September 1, 2023, FX risk\nfrom these positions were mitigated through hedging activity. This hedging activity was discontinued on September 1,\n2023. The risk system applies FX drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNTSI, a brokerage subsidiary of the Corporation, executes fixed-income securities trades directly for client accounts.\nA small inventory of securities remains held in inventory overnight. This portfolio exposure is de minimis, and VaR\ncalculations are not required. The valuation of the securities serves as the basis for calculating regulatory capital.\nForeign Currency Trading Risk Overview\nForeign currency or foreign exchange trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency\nother than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. The GFX\ntrading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed of spot, forward, non-deliverable forward, and foreign exchange rate (FX)\nswap transactions.\nFor FCBs, the daily high, low, average, and quarter-end VaR values were all less than $1.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nInterest Rate Derivatives Trading Risk Overview\nIRD positions exist when aggregate interest cash inflows and outflows do not offset each other in amount or offset each\nother over different time periods. The IRD trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed mostly of interest rate swaps\nentered into to meet clients’ interest rate risk management needs, but also including a small number of swaptions, caps, and\nfloors. IRD risk measures during the second quarter of 2023 became temporarily inflated as a result of transitions of IRD\ncontracts from LIBOR to SOFR referencing. The risk measures declined in the third quarter of 2023 as the bulk of\ntransitions was completed. For the IRD portfolio, the daily high, low, average, and as of December 31 VaR values were all\nless than $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Non-material Trading Activities\nNorthern Trust’s broker-dealer subsidiary, NTSI, maintains a portfolio of trading securities held for customer\naccommodation purposes and invests excess cash balances in short-term investment vehicles. The portfolio averaged $0.5\nmillion and $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTrading Book Risk Measurement\nFor trading book activities other than NTSI, Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S.\ncurrency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides\nestimates, based on high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in interest\nrates and non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign\ncurrency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies and interest rates. VaR is\ncomputed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.\nVaR measures are computed daily in a vendor software application which reads positions from Northern Trust’s\ntrading systems and foreign currency balances from the general ledger. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates,\ninterest rates, and volatilities for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs\nand outputs for reasonableness.\nTrading Book Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis\nNorthern Trust monitors several variations of the VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management\nneeds. Variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation and Taylor\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 89\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\napproximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent VaRs using only FX\ndrivers, only IR drivers, and only volatility drivers, and look-back periods of one year, two years, and four years. Those\nalternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern\nTrust’s market risks.\nAutomated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management\nfunction also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide\nmanagement with a historical perspective on risk.\nThe following table presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents for GFX in the years indicated\nbelow, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted\nvolatility. The total VaR for GFX is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits\nderived from the two subcomponents.\nTABLE 49: GLOBAL FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUE-AT-RISK\nTOTAL VaR\n(In Millions) (FX AND IR DRIVERS) FX VaR (FX DRIVERS ONLY) IR VaR (IR DRIVERS ONLY)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\nHigh $ 0.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.7 $ 0.2 $ 0.4 $ 0.3\nLow 0.1 0.1 — — — —\nAverage 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1\nAs of December 31, 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1\nDuring 2023 and 2022, Northern Trust did not incur an actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy\nineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as\nreputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk encompasses two main areas:\n• Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact\non financial markets and/or financial services firms.\n• Business risk arises from internal, secular, competitive, or regulatory trends that impact Northern Trust’s stated\nstrategy or its achievability.\nStrategic Risk Framework and Governance\nThe Corporate Strategic Risk Framework has been developed in conjunction with the Corporation’s risk appetite and risk\nmanagement policies, and defines the mission and expectations of the Strategic Risk Management function to identify and\nanalyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk.\nThis is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy, coordination of risk\ninput to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities, and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics\nwhich attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization.\nIn addition, the Strategic Risk Management function maintains the Global Event Response Program, which aims to\nanticipate and prepare for stress scenarios, and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur.\nBoth GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and\nframeworks by which Northern Trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk.\nClimate Risk\nClimate risk continues to be an evolving strategic risk for the Corporation. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising\nfrom climate change and is comprised of physical risk, liability risk and transition risk. Physical risk refers to risks to banks\nand the financial system emanating from the increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods,\nand fires). It can also refer to longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature and increased variability in weather\npatterns (e.g., sea level rise). Liability risk stems from the potential for litigation where institutions and boards do not\nadequately consider or respond to the impacts of climate change. Transition risk reflects the risks to banks and financial\nsystems of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy that may entail extensive policy, legal, technological, and market\nchanges. Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial\nand reputational risk to banks and the financial system.\nEffective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and\nwell-developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. We continue to build out and enhance our climate\nrisk management capabilities. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the Chief Climate and Sustainability\n90 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRisk Officer who reports directly to the CRO. The Risk Management function has created a dedicated climate and\nsustainability risk unit to monitor, oversee and take account of the increasing impact that climate change has, or may in the\nfuture have, on financial risk, nonfinancial risk, and regulatory compliance across the globe. The climate and sustainability\nrisk unit works to evolve the risk management framework to ensure the Corporation meets the expectations of all\nstakeholders as well as all climate-related commitments made by the Corporation to external agencies.\nThe Board of Directors, and in particular its Corporate Governance Committee, engages in active oversight of ESG\nmatters of significance to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Business Risk Committee provides oversight\nof certain financial and operational risks associated with climate change and other environmental factors through its\noversight of the Corporation’s global risk management framework and risk management policies. The Business Risk\nCommittee also engages in periodic discussions with management and members of the Risk Management function\nregarding strategic risks, including climate-related risk.\nThe Corporation expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Corporation\nwill continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change\nand risks driven by it evolve. Various regulatory agencies, investors, and other stakeholders have increased expectations\nand scrutiny in this area. The Corporation is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its\nactivities and to partner with key stakeholders to do the same.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 91\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report may include statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor\nprovisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are identified typically by\nwords or phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “likely,” “plan,” “goal,”\n“target,” “strategy,” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and\n“could.” Forward-looking statements include statements, other than those related to historical facts, that relate to Northern\nTrust’s financial results and outlook; capital adequacy; dividend policy and share repurchase program; accounting\nestimates and assumptions; credit quality including allowance levels; future pension plan contributions; effective tax rate;\nanticipated expense levels; contingent liabilities; acquisitions; strategies; market and industry trends; and expectations\nregarding the impact of accounting pronouncements and legislation. These statements are based on Northern Trust’s\ncurrent beliefs and expectations of future events or future results, and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to\npredict and subject to change. These statements are also based on assumptions about many important factors, including:\n• financial market disruptions or economic recession in the U.S. or other countries across the globe resulting from any of\na number of factors;\n• volatility or changes in financial markets, including debt and equity markets, that impact the value, liquidity, or credit\nratings of financial assets in general,

in\nthe future take, actions to provide asset value stability or additional liquidity;\n• the impact of equity markets on fee revenue;\n• changes in interest rates or in the monetary or other policies of various regulatory authorities or central banks;\n• Northern Trust’s success in controlling the costs and expenses of its business operations and the impacts of any\nbroader inflationary environment thereon;\n• a decline in the value of securities held in Northern Trust’s investment portfolio, the liquidity and pricing of which\nmay be negatively impacted by periods of economic turmoil and financial market disruptions;\n• Northern Trust’s ability to address operating risks, including those related to cybersecurity, data privacy and security,\nhuman errors or omissions, pricing or valuation of securities, fraud, operational resilience (including systems\nperformance), failure to maintain sustainable business practices, and breakdowns in processes or internal controls;\n• Northern Trust's success in responding to and investing in changes and advancements in technology;\n• geopolitical risks, risks related to global climate change and the risks of extraordinary events such as pandemics,\nnatural disasters, terrorist events and war (including the continuing military conflicts involving Ukraine and the\nRussian Federation and Israel and Hamas and other evolving events in the Middle East), and the responses of the U.S.\nand other countries to those events;\n• unexpected deposit outflows;\n• the effectiveness of Northern Trust’s management of

Net\ninterest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Management\nbelieves this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When\nadjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the\nadjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nTABLE 50: RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Interest Income\nInterest Income - GAAP $ 7,325.0 $ 2,877.7 $ 1,406.5\nAdd: FTE Adjustment 57.5 45.6 35.6\nInterest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP $ 7,382.5 $ 2,923.3 $ 1,442.1\nNet Interest Income - GAAP $ 1,982.0 $ 1,887.2 $ 1,382.7\nAdd: FTE Adjustment 57.5 45.6 35.6\nNet Interest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP $ 2,039.5 $ 1,932.8 $ 1,418.3\nNet Interest Margin - GAAP 1.52 % 1.36 % 0.96 %\nNet Interest Margin (FTE) - Non-GAAP 1.56 % 1.39 % 0.99 %\nTotal Revenue\nTotal Revenue - GAAP $ 6,773.5 $ 6,761.2 $ 6,464.5\nAdd: FTE Adjustment 57.5 45.6 35.6\nTotal Revenue (FTE) - Non-GAAP $ 6,831.0 $ 6,806.8 $ 6,500.1\n94 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nITEM 7A – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Risk Management” section of Item 7,\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nITEM 8 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries (the\nCorporation) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023,\nand the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 95\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses for commercial loans evaluated on a collective basis\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses\nfor commercial loans evaluated on a collective basis (the collective ACL) was $135.4 million of a total allowance for\ncredit losses assigned to loans of $178.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Expected credit losses are measured on a\ncollective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. The\nallowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation’s\nfinancial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods.\nThe estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into\nsegments based on loan and obligor specific factors, including loan type, borrower type, collateral type, loan size, and\nborrower credit quality. The estimation methodology applies probability of default and loss given default assumptions\nto the projected exposure at default on a pool basis. For each segment, the probability of default (PD) and loss given\ndefault (LGD) are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument. For the first two years (the\nreasonable and supportable period), these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using\nmodels developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar factors, including the\nborrower rating assigned to individual obligors, as applicable. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable\nperiod, the Corporation reverts to its own long-run historical loss experience on a straight-line basis over four quarters.\nThe projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end.\nEstimating expected lifetime credit losses requires the consideration of the effect of future economic conditions. The\nCorporation employs multiple scenarios over a reasonable and supportable period to project future conditions. The\nCorporation determines the probability weights assigned to each scenario at each quarter-end. The quantitative\nallowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework, through which the Corporation applies\njudgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and environmental\nfactors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute adjustments to the quantitative allowance that may\nimpact individual or multiple segments of the loan portfolio.\nWe identified the assessment of the quantitative component of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high\ndegree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was\ninvolved in the assessment of the quantitative component of the collective ACL due to significant measurement\nuncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the quantitative component of the collective\nACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD and LGD and their significant\nassumptions, the multiple economic forecast scenarios and macroeconomic factors and their respective weightings, and\nborrower ratings for certain commercial loans. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency\nof audit evidence obtained.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design\nand operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related\nto the Corporation’s measurement of the quantitative component of the collective ACL estimate, including controls\nover:\n• development of the quantitative component of the collective ACL methodology\n• development, calibration and/or performance monitoring of certain PD and LGD models\n• development and approval of the multiple economic forecast scenarios, macroeconomic factors and their\nrespective weightings\n• identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain PD and LGD models\n• analysis of the allowance for credit losses for loans results.\nWe evaluated the Corporation’s process to develop the quantitative component of the collective ACL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Corporation used, and considered the relevance and\nreliability of such data, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n• evaluating the quantitative component of the Corporation’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles\n• evaluating judgments made by the Corporation relative to the development, calibration and/or performance\nmonitoring of certain PD and LGD models\n• assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of certain PD and LGD models by inspecting model\ndocumentation to determine whether the models were suitable for their intended use\n96 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\n• assessing the economic forecast scenarios, the economic input variables and their respective weightings through\ncomparison to publicly available forecasts and the Corporation’s business environment\n• testing individual borrower ratings for a selection of commercial loan relationships by evaluating the financial\nperformance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral.\nWe also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the quantitative component of the collective\nACL by evaluating the:\n• cumulative results of the procedures\n• qualitative aspects of the Corporation’s accounting practices\n• potential bias in the accounting estimate\nWe have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 2002.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 27, 2024\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 97\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) and reporting practices prescribed for the banking industry. A description of the more significant accounting\npolicies follows.\nA. Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northern Trust Corporation\n(Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (Bank), and various other wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of the Corporation and Bank. Throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the term\n“Northern Trust” refers to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation. The consolidated statements of income include results of acquired subsidiaries from the dates\nof acquisition. Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified consistent with the current year’s presentation.\nB. Nature of Operations. The Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in\nChicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. The Corporation conducts business in the United States (U.S.) and\ninternationally through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Bank.\nNorthern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing\nand Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management\nclients primarily by the Asset Management business.\nAsset Servicing is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement\nfunds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional\ninvestors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not\nlimited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and\nanalytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage\nservices; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the\nBank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe,\nthe Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals,\nretirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth\nManagement provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting;\nguardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and\nprivate and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which provides customized\nservices, including but not limited to: investment consulting; global custody; fiduciary; and private banking; family office\nconsulting, and technology solutions, to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals\nand family offices across the globe. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a\nnetwork of offices in 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.\nC. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity\nwith GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant\naccounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nD. Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation. Asset and liability accounts denominated in nonfunctional\ncurrencies are remeasured into functional currencies at period-end rates of exchange, except for certain balance sheet items\nincluding but not limited to buildings and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured at\nhistorical exchange rates. Results from remeasurement of asset and liability accounts are reported in Other Operating\nIncome on the consolidated statements of income. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at period-average rates of\nexchange.\nAsset and liability accounts of entities with functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are translated at period-\nend rates of exchange. Income and expense accounts are translated at period-average rates of exchange. Translation\nadjustments, net of applicable taxes, are reported directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity.\nE. Securities. Available for Sale (AFS) Securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses credited or\ncharged, net of the tax effect, to AOCI. Realized gains and losses on AFS securities are determined on a specific\nidentification basis and are reported within Investment Security Gains (Losses), net, on the consolidated statements of\n102 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nincome. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of\ndiscount.\nHeld to Maturity (HTM) Securities consist of debt securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the\nability to, hold until maturity. Such securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of\ndiscount. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of\ndiscount.\nHeld for Trading Securities are reported at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held for\ntrading are reported within Security Commissions and Trading Income on the consolidated statements of income.\nNonmarketable Securities primarily consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock\nand community development investments, each of which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are reported at cost, which represents redemption\nvalue. Community development investments are typically reported at amortized cost. Those community development\ninvestments that are designed to generate a return primarily through realization of tax credits and other tax benefits, which\nare discussed in further detail in Note 28, “Variable Interest Entities,” are amortized over the lives of the related tax credits\nand other tax benefits.\nF. Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase.\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as\ncollateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To\nminimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is\nmonitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly\nassessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities\npurchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged\nto the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under agreements to repurchase against those\npurchased under agreements to resell when the requirements to net are met.\nG. Derivative Financial Instruments. Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in\nthe normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account, and as part\nof its risk management activities. These instruments generally include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts,\ntotal return swap contracts and credit default swap contracts. All derivative financial instruments, whether designated as\nhedges or not, are recorded at fair value within Other Assets and Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance\nsheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. These derivative assets\nand liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, derivative counterparties. The\naccounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative on the consolidated statements of income depends on whether or not\nthe contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivative financial\ninstruments are recorded within the line item, Other Operating Activities, net, on the consolidated statement of cash flows,\nexcept for net investment hedges which are recorded within Other Investing Activities, net.\nChanges in the fair value of client-related and trading derivative instruments, which are not designated hedges under\nGAAP, are recognized currently in either Foreign Exchange Trading Income or Security Commissions and Trading Income\non the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk\nmanagement purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in Other Operating Income on the\nconsolidated statements of income. Certain derivative instruments used by Northern Trust to manage risk are formally\ndesignated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges.\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of\nassets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes\nin the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in Interest Income or\nInterest Expense on the consolidated statements of income. For substantially all fair value hedges, Northern Trust applies\nthe “shortcut” method of accounting, available under GAAP. As a result, changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged\nitem are assumed to equal the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative. For fair value hedges that do not qualify for the\n“shortcut” method of accounting, Northern Trust utilizes regression analysis in assessing whether these hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter.\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or\nforecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of such\nderivatives are recognized in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity, and there is no change to the accounting for the\nhedged item. Balances in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings, and\nare reflected in the same income statement line item. Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting for cash\nflow hedges of certain available for sale investment securities. For cash flow hedges of certain other available for sale\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 103\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninvestment securities, foreign currency denominated investment securities, and forecasted foreign currency denominated\nrevenue and expenditure transactions, Northern Trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities, to the extent all\nterms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis. For cash flow hedges of forecasted\nforeign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions and investment securities, to the extent all terms are\nnot perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using the dollar-offset method.\nForeign exchange contracts and qualifying non-derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to\nminimize Northern Trust’s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S.\nbranches and subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in AOCI consistent with the\nrelated translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment. For net investment hedges, all critical terms of the hedged\nitem and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis. Amounts recorded in AOCI are\nreclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary.\nFair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous\nwith the transaction. The formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and\nhedged items. Included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for\nundertaking such hedges, the nature of the risk being hedged, and a description of the method for assessing hedge\neffectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. For hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” or the critical terms\nmatch methods of accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used\nin hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged\nitem. Hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is terminated or sold, if a\nhedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or if Northern Trust removes the derivative’s hedge\ndesignation. Subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in Foreign Exchange Trading Income or\nSecurity Commissions and Trading Income on the consolidated statements of income. For discontinued cash flow hedges,\nthe accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the\npreviously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring. For discontinued fair\nvalue hedges, the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value. Previous\nadjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item.\nH. Loans. Loans are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or\ndeterminable dates. Loans are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment (segment) and by class. Northern\nTrust has defined its segments as commercial and personal. A class of loans is a subset of a segment, the components of\nwhich have similar risk characteristics, measurement attributes, or risk monitoring methods. The classes within the\ncommercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, non-U.S. and other. The\nclasses within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate, private client and other.\nLoan Classification. Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of\nunearned income. Loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. Undrawn commitments\nrelating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in Other Liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees\nwith an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated expected losses.\nNonaccrual Loans and Recognition of Income. Interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless, in the\nopinion of management, there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement, or\ninterest or principal is more than 90 days contractually past due and the loan is not well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonaccrual and interest income is recorded on a cash basis. Past\ndue status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due. For\ndisclosure purposes, loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current. At the time a loan is determined to be\nnonaccrual, interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest collected on\nnonaccrual loans is applied to principal unless, in the opinion of management, collectability of principal is not in doubt.\nManagement’s assessment of indicators of loan collectability, and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income,\nincluding the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition, do not meaningfully vary between the different\nloan classes. Nonaccrual loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer\nexist. Factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and, in\naccordance with regulatory guidance, relate primarily to expected payment performance. A loan is eligible to be returned to\nperforming status when: (i) no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is expected or (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured (possessing realizable value sufficient\nto discharge the debt, including accrued interest, in full) and is in the process of collection (through action reasonably\nexpected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future). A loan that has not been brought\nfully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance\n(generally a minimum of six payment periods) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms, and Northern\nTrust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, a loan that has been formally\n104 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrestructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned\nto accrual status, provided there was a well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and\nprospects of repayment under the revised terms, and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally\na minimum of six payment periods) under the revised terms.\nLoan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty - After the Adoption of Accounting Standards\nUpdate No. 2022-02. For borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, Northern Trust may provide payment relief by\nmodifying the terms of the original loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty involve\nprimarily the extensions of term, deferrals of principal and interest, interest rate concessions, and other modifications or a\ncombination thereof. Northern Trust considers payment deferrals of less than 90 days as insignificant, absent any material\nmodifications to other loan terms.\nThe expected credit loss for modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is measured based on either\nthe expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, or other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. When\nthe discounted cash flow method is applied, the expected credit loss reflects the difference between the amortized cost basis\nand the present value of the expected cash flows and is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash\nflows, discounted at the post-modification effective interest rate and contractual terms. If a loan’s contractual interest rate\nvaries based on subsequent changes in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the loan’s effective interest rate is\ncalculated based on the factor as it changes over the life of the loan. Northern Trust elected not to project changes in the\nfactor for purposes of estimating expected future cash flows. If the loan is collateral dependent, the expected loss is\nmeasured based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date.\nIf the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, either an allowance is established or a charge-off is\nrecorded for the difference. The nature and extent of further deterioration in credit quality, including a subsequent default,\nis considered in the determination of an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for all loan modifications to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) - Prior to the Adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-02. A loan\nthat was modified as a concession by Northern Trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties\nwas referred to as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). All TDRs were reported starting in the calendar year of their\nrestructuring. In subsequent years, a TDR may have ceased to be reported if the loan was modified at a market rate and\nperformed according to the modified terms for at least six payment periods. A loan that was modified at a below market\nrate was returned to accrual status if it satisfied the six-payment-period performance requirement.\nThe expected credit loss was measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the\neffective interest rate based on the original contractual rate. If a loan’s contractual interest rate varied based on subsequent\nchanges in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the loan’s effective interest rate was calculated based on the\nfactor as it changed over the life of the loan. Northern Trust elected not to project changes in the factor for purposes of\nestimating expected future cash flows. Further, Northern Trust elected not to adjust the effective interest rate for\nprepayments. If the loan was collateral dependent, the expected loss was measured based on the fair value of the collateral\nat the reporting date.\nIf the loan valuation was less than the recorded value of the loan, either an allowance was established, or a charge-off\nwas recorded, for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than $1 million) homogeneous loans were collectively\nevaluated.\nAll loans with TDR modifications were evaluated for additional expected credit losses. The nature and extent of\nfurther deterioration in credit quality, including a subsequent default, was considered in the determination of an appropriate\nlevel of allowance for credit losses.\nCollateral Dependent Financial Assets. A financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral.\nMost of Northern Trust’s collateral dependent credit exposure relates to its residential real estate portfolio for which the\ncollateral is usually the underlying real estate property. For collateral dependent financial assets, it is Northern Trust’s\npolicy to reserve or charge-off the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the value of the collateral.\nPremium, Discounts, Origination Costs and Fees. Premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment\nof yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Certain direct origination costs and fees are\nnetted, deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loan’s yield.\nI. Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses represents management’s best estimate of lifetime\nexpected credit losses related to various financial assets subject to credit risk and off-balance sheet credit exposure.\nNorthern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis.\nA financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the\nrelated allowance is determined through an individual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent\non any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 105\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nof which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nForecasting and Reversion. Estimating expected lifetime credit losses requires the consideration of the effect of future\neconomic conditions. Northern Trust employs multiple scenarios over a reasonable and supportable period (currently two\nyears) to project future conditions. Key variables determined to be relevant for projecting credit losses on the portfolios in\nscope include macroeconomic factors, such as corporate profits, unemployment, and real estate price indices, as well as\nfinancial market factors such as equity prices, volatility, and credit spreads. For periods beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable period, Northern Trust reverts to its own historical loss experiences on a straight-line basis over four quarters.\nAllowance for Loans. The allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data\nrepresentative of the Corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both\nexpansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework\nsegregate the loan portfolio into homogeneous segments based on similar risk characteristics or risk monitoring methods.\nNorthern Trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit\nallowance on a collective basis. For each of the different parameters, specific credit models or qualitative estimation\nmethodologies for the individual loan segments were developed. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss\ngiven default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of\nthe allowance. The quantitative allowance is then reviewed within a qualitative adjustment framework, through which\nmanagement applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and\nenvironmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance\nfor each segment and class of the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance related to credit exposures evaluated on an individual basis is determined through evaluations of\nindividual loans, and lending-related commitments that have defaulted, generally those with Borrower Ratings of 8 and 9,\nthat are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrowers’\nability to pay. For defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the\nunderlying collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are\ngenerally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable\nvalue of the collateral.\nNorthern Trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet activity using a\nconsistent methodology for the quantitative framework as well as the qualitative framework. For purposes of estimating the\nallowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, the exposure at default includes\nestimated drawdowns of the undrawn commitments based on credit utilization factors, resulting in a proportionate amount\nof expected credit losses.\nAllowance for HTM Securities. HTM debt securities classified as U.S. government, government sponsored agency,\nand certain securities classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions are considered to be guarantees of the\nU.S. government or an agency of the U.S. government, and therefore an allowance for credit losses is not estimated for\nsuch investments as the expected probability of non-payment of the amortized cost basis is zero.\nHTM debt securities classified as “other asset-backed securities” represent pools of underlying receivables from which\nthe cash flows are used to pay the bonds that vary in seniority. Utilizing a qualitative estimation approach, the allowance\nfor other asset-backed securities is assessed by evaluating underlying pool performance based on delinquency rates and\navailable credit support.\nHTM debt securities classified as “other” relate to investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations\nunder the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified\ninvestments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within\nNorthern Trust’s market area. The allowance for CRA investments is assessed using a qualitative estimation approach\nprimarily based on internal historical performance experience and default history of the underlying CRA portfolios to\ndetermine a quantitative component of the allowance.\nThe allowance estimation methodology for all other HTM debt securities is developed using a combination of external\nand internal data. The estimation methodology groups securities with shared characteristics for which the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative component of the\nallowance.\nAllowance for AFS Securities. AFS securities impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate\nsecurities that have indications of possible credit losses. A determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value\nis related to credit impairment takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor\ncan vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is credit related include, but are\nnot limited to, the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment; the financial condition and near-term prospects\nof the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent\nregarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that Northern Trust will not be required to\n106 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each\nsecurity meeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to\ndetermine if a credit loss has occurred that is then based on the best estimate of cash flows to be collected from the security,\ndiscounted using the security’s effective interest rate. If the present value of the expected cash flows is found to be less than\nthe current amortized cost of the security, an allowance for credit losses is generally recorded equal to the difference\nbetween the two amounts, limited to the amount the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the security.\nIf management intends to sell, or will more likely than not be required to sell, an AFS security prior to recovery of its\namortized cost basis, the security is written down to fair value with unrealized losses recognized in Investment Security\nGains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income.\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets. The allowance for other financial assets covers assets categorized as Due from\nBanks, Other Central Bank Deposits, Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks, Federal Funds Sold, and Other Assets. The\nOther Assets category includes other miscellaneous credit exposures reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance\nsheets. The allowance estimation methodology for other financial assets primarily utilizes a similar approach as the one\nused for the HTM debt securities portfolio. It consists of a combination of externally and internally developed loss data,\nadjusted for the appropriate contractual term. Northern Trust’s portfolio is composed mostly of institutions within the “1 to\n3” internal borrower rating category and is expected to exhibit minimal to modest likelihood of loss.\nThe portion of the allowance assigned to loans, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets is presented as a contra\nasset in Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn\nloan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The\nallowance for AFS securities is presented parenthetically with the amortized cost basis of AFS securities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nProvision for Credit Losses. Provision for Credit Losses on the consolidated statements of income represents the\nchange in the Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets and is the charge to current period earnings.\nIt represents the amount needed to maintain the Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets at an\nappropriate level to absorb lifetime expected credit losses related to financial assets in scope. Actual losses may vary from\ncurrent estimates and the amount of the Provision for Credit Losses may be either greater than or less than actual net\ncharge-offs.\nContractual Term. Northern Trust estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial assets\nadjusted for prepayments, unless prepayments are not relevant to specific portfolios or sub-portfolios. Extension and\nrenewal options are typically not considered since it is not Northern Trust’s practice to enter into arrangements where the\nborrower has the unconditional option to renew, or a conditional extension option whereby the conditions are beyond\nNorthern Trust’s control.\nAccrued Interest. Northern Trust elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables\nrelated to its loan and securities portfolios as its policy is to write-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a\ntimely manner. Accrued interest is written off by reversing interest income during the quarter the financial asset is moved\nfrom an accrual to a nonaccrual status.\nJ. Standby Letters of Credit. Fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in Other Operating Income on the\nconsolidated statements of income using the straight-line method over the lives of the underlying agreements. Northern\nTrust’s recorded other liability for standby letters of credit, reflecting the obligation it has undertaken, is measured as the\namount of unamortized fees on these instruments.\nK. Buildings and Equipment. Buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation.\nThe charge for depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the following range of lives: buildings –\nup to 30 years; equipment – 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements – the shorter of the lease term or 15 years.\nL. Other Real Estate Owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired\nin partial or total satisfaction of loans. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell\nand are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is typically based on third-party appraisals.\nAppraisals of OREO properties are updated on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s\njudgment as to the realizable value of the properties. Losses identified during the 90-day period after the acquisition of such\nproperties are charged against the Allowance for Credit Losses assigned to Loans. Subsequent write-downs to the carrying\nvalue of these assets that may be required and gains or losses realized from asset sales are recorded within Other Operating\nExpense on the consolidated statements of income.\nM. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Separately identifiable acquired\nintangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis.\nPurchased software, software licenses, and allowable internal costs, including compensation relating to software developed\nfor internal use, are capitalized. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 107\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nassets, generally ranging from 3 to 10 years. Fees paid for the use of software services that do not convey a software\nlicense are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nN. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are recorded on an accrual\nbasis, over the period in which the service is provided. Fees are primarily a function of the market value of assets\ncustodied, managed and serviced, transaction volumes, and securities lending volume and spreads, as set forth in the\nunderlying client agreement. This revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including\ncomponents that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes.\nO. Client Security Settlement Receivables. These receivables result from custody client security sales executed under\ncontractual settlement date accounting that have not yet settled as well as custody client withdrawals from short-term\ninvestment funds that settle on the following business day. Northern Trust advances cash to the client on the date of either\ntrade execution or client withdrawal and awaits collection from either the settled trade or short-term investment funds.\nP. Income Taxes. Northern Trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. The objective is to\nrecognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor future tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax\nbases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax\nrates.\nTax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained\nupon examination by tax authorities. Only tax positions that are considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained are\nrecorded on the consolidated financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if it is more-\nlikely-than-not that all or a portion will not be realized. Northern Trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for Income Taxes on the consolidated statements of income.\nQ. Cash Flow Statements. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements have been defined as “Cash and Due\nfrom Banks” on the consolidated balance sheets.\nR. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Northern Trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension\nand other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. Overfunded pension and postretirement benefits are\nreported in Other Assets and underfunded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in Other Liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at December 31, unless specific\ncircumstances require an interim remeasurement. Plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing\nobservable market prices. The projected benefit obligations are determined based on the present value of projected benefit\ndistributions at an assumed discount rate. Actuarial gains and losses accumulated in AOCI are amortized as a component of\nnet periodic pension cost if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of\nplan assets as of the beginning of the year. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected average\nremaining service period of the active employees or over the expected remaining lifetime of plan participants for plans that\nhave been previously frozen.\nS. Share-Based Compensation Plans. Northern Trust recognizes as expense the grant-date fair value of stock and stock\nunit awards and other share-based compensation granted to employees as Compensation on the consolidated statements of\nincome. The fair values of stock and stock unit awards, including performance stock unit awards and director awards, are\nbased on the closing price of the Corporation’s stock on the date of grant adjusted for certain awards that do not accrue\ndividends while vesting.\nCompensation expense for share-based award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule, whereby\nportions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance stock unit awards are recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on expected achievement of the performance\ncondition. Adjustments are made for employees that meet certain eligibility criteria at the grant date or during the requisite\nservice period.\nNorthern Trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of share-based compensation\nexpense. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur. Dividend equivalents are\naccrued for performance stock unit awards, most restricted stock unit awards, and director awards not yet vested, and are\npaid upon vesting. Certain restricted stock units are not entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Cash\nflows resulting from the realization of excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows on the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\n108 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nT. Net Income Per Common Share. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income/loss\napplicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted\nnet income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common\nshares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common\nshare equivalents calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock method. In a period of a net loss, diluted\nnet income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common share.\nNorthern Trust calculates net income applicable to common stock using the two-class method, whereby net income is\nallocated between common stock and participating securities.\nNote 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, Northern Trust adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-01, “Derivatives and Hedging\n(Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method” (ASU 2022-01). The amendments in ASU 2022-01 expand the\ncurrent last-of-layer hedging model from a single-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio.\nTo reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method is renamed the portfolio layer method. In addition, ASU 2022-01 (1)\nexpands the scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-prepayable assets, (2) specifies eligible hedging instruments\nin a single-layer hedge, (3) provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments\nunder the portfolio layer method and (4) specifies how hedge basis adjustments should be considered when determining\ncredit losses for the assets included in the closed portfolio. Upon adoption of ASU 2022-01, there was no impact to\nNorthern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nOn January 1, 2023, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures” (ASU 2022-02). The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminate the\naccounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for creditors that have adopted the current expected credit\nlosses accounting standard while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires that a public business entity disclose\ncurrent-period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. Upon\nadoption of ASU 2022-02, there was no significant impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated\nstatements of income. Please refer to Note 5, “Loans” for further information.\nOn January 1, 2023, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50):\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations” (ASU 2022-04). The amendments in ASU 2022-04 enhance the\ntransparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors or other allocators of capital. Specifically, ASU\n2022-04 requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative information\nabout the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period,\nchanges from period to period, and potential magnitude. Upon adoption of ASU 2022-04, there was no impact to Northern\nTrust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 109\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3 – Fair Value Measurements\nFair value under GAAP is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit\nprice) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nFair Value Hierarchy. The following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs (Levels 1, 2, and 3) used to measure fair\nvalue and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity;\nunobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability\nbased on the best information available. GAAP requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs. Financial instruments\nare categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation. Northern Trust’s\npolicy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the\ntransfer occurred. No transfers into or out of Level 3 occurred during the years ended December 31, 2023, or 2022.\nLevel 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities. Northern Trust’s Level 1 assets are comprised\nprimarily of AFS investments in U.S. Treasury securities.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in active markets. Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include AFS and certain trading\naccount debt securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Prices received\nfrom vendors are compared to other vendor and third-party prices. If a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is\ndetermined to exceed pre-determined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset type’s characteristics, the\nexception is researched and, if the price is not able to be validated, an alternate pricing vendor is utilized, consistent with\nNorthern Trust’s pricing source hierarchy. As of December 31, 2023, Northern Trust’s AFS debt securities portfolio\nincluded 929 Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of $19.5 billion. All 929 debt securities were valued by\nexternal pricing vendors. As of December 31, 2022, Northern Trust’s AFS debt securities portfolio included 1,163 Level 2\ndebt securities with an aggregate market value of $24.0 billion. All 1,163 debt securities were valued by external pricing\nvendors.\nNorthern Trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by\nexternal pricing vendors, including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities. On a daily\nbasis, periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices\non similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous day’s reported prices for each security.\nPredetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market\ninformation or the use of an alternate pricing vendor. Quarterly, Northern Trust reviews documentation from third-party\npricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair\nvalue levels assigned by Northern Trust to each security classification are appropriate. Annually, valuation inputs used\nwithin third-party pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs\nused to comparable market data, including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications\ncomprising significant portions of the portfolio.\nLevel 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted\nincome-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms\nof the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; interest\nrates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option\ncontracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its\nderivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the\nremaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar\nagreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative\ninstruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material.\nLevel 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.\nNorthern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of 1.1 million\nand 1.0 million shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock (Visa Class B common shares) previously held by Northern\nTrust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with\nthe ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A\ncommon shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and\nNorthern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic\npayments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common\nshares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about\n110 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nestimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on\nwhich such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See\n“Visa Class B Common Shares” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” for further information.\nNorthern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however,\nthe use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a\nmaterial effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.\nManagement of various businesses and departments of Northern Trust (including Corporate Market Risk, Credit Risk\nManagement, Corporate Finance, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management) reviews valuation methods and models for\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability.\nManagement of the appropriate business or department reviews assumed inputs, especially when unobservable in the\nmarketplace, in order to substantiate their use in each fair value measurement. When appropriate, management reviews\nforecasts used in the valuation process in light of other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between\ncurrent and previous fair value measurements. In certain circumstances, third party information is used to support the fair\nvalue measurements. If certain third party information seems inconsistent with consensus views, a review of the\ninformation is performed by management of the respective business or department to determine the appropriate fair value\nof the asset or liability.\nThe following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nas well as the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and quantitative information used to develop\nsignificant unobservable inputs for such liabilities as of such dates.\nTABLE 51: LEVEL 3 SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nWEIGHTED-\nVALUATION UNOBSERVABLE AVERAGE INPUT\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT FAIR VALUE TECHNIQUE INPUTS INPUT VALUES VALUES(1)\nSwaps Related to Sale of Certain $25.4 million Discounted Cash Conversion Rate 1.59x 1.59x\nVisa Class B Common Shares Flow\nVisa Class A\n10.49% 10.49%\nAppreciation\nExpected Duration 9 - 27 months 13 months\n(1) Weighted average of expected duration based on scenario probability.\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nWEIGHTED-\nVALUATION UNOBSERVABLE AVERAGE INPUT\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT FAIR VALUE TECHNIQUE INPUTS INPUT VALUES VALUES(1)\nSwaps Related to Sale of Certain $34.8 million Discounted Cash Conversion Rate 1.60x 1.60x\nVisa Class B Common Shares Flow\nVisa Class A\n8.53% 8.53%\nAppreciation\nExpected Duration 12 - 33 months 20 months\n(1) Weighted average of expected duration based on scenario probability.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 111\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nsegregated by fair value hierarchy level.\nTABLE 52: RECURRING BASIS HIERARCHY LEVELING\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nASSETS/\nLIABILITIES\nAT FAIR\n(In Millions) LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 NETTING VALUE\nDebt Securities\nAvailable for Sale\nU.S. Government $ 3,622.2 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,622.2\nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions — 295.8 — — 295.8\nGovernment Sponsored Agency — 11,553.0 — — 11,553.0\nNon-U.S. Government — 264.4 — — 264.4\nCorporate Debt — 279.5 — — 279.5\nCovered Bonds — 347.1 — — 347.1\nSub-Sovereign, Supranational and Non-U.S. Agency — 2,899.9 — — 2,899.9\nBonds\nOther Asset-Backed — 2,962.6 — — 2,962.6\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed — 865.3 — — 865.3\nTotal Available for Sale 3,622.2 19,467.6 — — 23,089.8\nOther Assets\nMoney Market Investment 95.0 — — — 95.0\nDerivative Assets\nForeign Exchange Contracts — 3,266.7 — (2,937.2) 329.5\nInterest Rate Contracts — 301.5 — (189.5) 112.0\nTotal Derivative Assets — 3,568.2 — (3,126.7) 441.5\nOther Liabilities\nDerivative Liabilities\nForeign Exchange Contracts — 3,255.2 — (2,175.7) 1,079.5\nInterest Rate Contracts — 369.2 — (6.0) 363.2\nOther Financial Derivatives(1) — — 25.4 (23.7) 1.7\nTotal Derivative Liabilities $ — $ 3,624.4 $ 25.4 $ (2,205.4) $ 1,444.4\nNote: Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern\nTrust and the counterparty.

A determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is related to credit\nimpairment takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by\nsecurity. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is credit-related include, but are not limited\nto, the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the\nissuer; activity in the market of the issuer, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent regarding\nthe sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that Northern Trust will not be required to sell the\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 117\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsecurity for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each security\nmeeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if a\ncredit loss has occurred.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Corporation intended to sell certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss\nposition.

In\nNovember 2023, the Corporation sold an additional $3.2 billion of AFS securities with a fair value of $3.0 billion, which\nresulted in a $176.4 million loss recognized in Investment Securities Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of\nincome for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nThere was a $1.2 million allowance for credit losses for AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nprimarily for corporate debt securities, reflecting a $0.1 million release from December 31, 2022. There was a $1.3 million\nallowance for credit losses for AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily for corporate debt\nsecurities, reflecting an increase of $1.3 million from December 31, 2021. The process for identifying credit losses for AFS\nsecurities is based on the best estimate of cash flows to be collected from the security, discounted using the security’s\neffective interest rate. If the present value of the expected cash flows is found to be less than the current amortized cost of\nthe security, an allowance for credit losses is generally recorded equal to the difference between the two amounts, limited\nto the amount the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the security.

Northern Trust’s equity credit line products generally have draw\nperiods of up to 10 years and a balloon payment of any outstanding balance is due at maturity. Payments are interest-only\nwith variable interest rates. Northern Trust does not offer equity credit lines that include an option to convert the\noutstanding balance to an amortizing payment loan. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, equity credit lines totaled $228.7\nmillion and $248.6 million, respectively. Equity credit lines for which first liens were held by Northern Trust represented\n96% and 98% of the total equity credit lines as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded within the other commercial, non-U.S. commercial, and other personal classes are short duration advances,\nprimarily related to the processing of custodied client investments, totaling $8.4 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The $8.4 billion short duration advances at December 31, 2023 primarily reflected higher\nlevels of year-end trading and settlement activity. Demand deposit overdrafts reclassified as loan balances, primarily in\npersonal-other, totaled $12.1 million and $24.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no loans\nclassified as held for sale on either December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. Loans classified as held for sale are\nrecorded at the lower of cost or fair value. There was a $2.5 million commercial real estate loan sold during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. There were $11.2 million of loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2022, which were\ncomposed of residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 121\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCredit Quality Indicators. Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information\nregarding the relative credit risk of loans. Northern Trust uses a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk\nof loans at the segment, class, and individual credit exposure levels.\nAs part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification,\napproval, and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting and management reporting.\nRisk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and their probability of default. Each borrower is rated using\none of a number of ratings models, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary\namong classes of loans in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit\nexposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust’s\nborrower rating models, by loan class:\n• Commercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;\n• Commercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support;\n• Commercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;\n• Non-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels;\n• Residential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-value ratio;\n• Private Client: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and\n• Personal-Other: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios.\nWhile the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and\nranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in\ndefault range from “1” for the strongest credits to “7” for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of “8” or “9” are used\nfor defaulted borrowers. Borrower risk ratings are monitored and are revised when events or circumstances indicate a\nchange is required. Risk ratings are generally validated at least annually.\nLoans in the “1 to 3” category are expected to exhibit minimal to modest probabilities of default and are characterized\nby borrowers having the strongest financial qualities, including above average financial flexibility, cash flows and capital\nlevels. Borrowers assigned these ratings are anticipated to experience very little to moderate financial pressure in adverse\ndown-cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a minimal to modest\nlikelihood of loss. Loans in the “4 to 5” category are expected to exhibit moderate to acceptable probabilities of default and\nare characterized by borrowers with less financial flexibility than those in the “1 to 3” category. Cash flows and capital\nlevels are generally sufficient to allow for borrowers to meet current requirements, but have fewer financial resources to\nmanage through economic downturns. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a\nmoderate likelihood of loss. Loans in the watch list category have elevated credit risk profiles that are monitored through\ninternal watch lists, and consist of credits with borrower ratings of “6 to 9.” These credits, which include all nonaccrual\ncredits, are expected to exhibit probabilities of default, elevated risk of default, or are currently in default. Borrowers\nassociated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default have limited financial flexibility. Cash flows and capital\nlevels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements, particularly in adverse down cycle\nscenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers in this category exhibit an elevated to probable likelihood of loss.\nLoan segment and class balances as of December 31, 2023 are provided in the following table, segregated by borrower\nratings into “1 to 3,” “4 to 5” and “6 to 9” (watch list and nonaccrual status) categories by year of origination at amortized\ncost basis. Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income.\n122 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Of the loans that were modified since the adoption of ASU 2022-02 as of\nJanuary 1, 2023, and were not performing in accordance with their modified terms and considered past due for purposes of\nthese disclosures as of December 31, 2023, were $4.7 million 30-89 days past due and $16.2 million 90 days and greater\npast due. As of December 31, 2023, Northern Trust charged-off $2.0 million related to modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty that had been processed since the adoption of ASU 2022-02.\nThere were no undrawn loan commitments or standby letters of credit issued to financially distressed borrowers for\nwhich Northern Trust had modified the payment terms of the loans as of December 31, 2023.\n126 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (Prior to the Adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2022-02)\nPrior to January 1, 2023, a loan that was modified as a concession by Northern Trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from\nthe debtor’s financial difficulties was referred to as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). All TDRs were reported starting in\nthe calendar year of their restructuring. In subsequent years, a TDR may cease being reported if the loan was modified at a\nmarket rate and performed according to the modified terms for at least six payment periods. A loan that was modified at a\nbelow market rate returned to accrual status if it satisfied the six-payment-period performance requirement.\nThe expected credit loss was measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the\neffective interest rate based on the original contractual rate. If a loan’s contractual interest rate varied based on subsequent\nchanges in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the loan’s effective interest rate was calculated based on the\nfactor as it changed over the life of the loan. Northern Trust elected not to project changes in the factor for purposes of\nestimating expected future cash flows. Further, Northern Trust elected not to adjust the effective interest rate for\nprepayments. If the loan was collateral dependent, the expected loss was measured based on the fair value of the collateral\nat the reporting date. If the loan valuation was less than the recorded value of the loan, either an allowance was established\nor a charge-off was recorded for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than $1 million) homogeneous loans\nwere collectively evaluated. Northern Trust’s accounting policies for material nonaccrual loans was consistent across all\nclasses of loans.\nAll loans with TDR modifications were evaluated for additional expected credit losses. The nature and extent of\nfurther deterioration in credit quality, including a subsequent default, was considered in the determination of an appropriate\nlevel of allowance for credit losses.\nIncluded within nonaccrual loans were $35.3 million of nonaccrual TDRs, and $39.7 million of accrual TDRs as of\nDecember 31, 2022. There were $0.2 million of aggregate undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit at\nDecember 31, 2022, issued to borrowers with TDR modifications of loans.\nTDR modifications involved extensions of term, deferrals of principal, interest rate concessions, and other\nmodifications. Other modifications typically reflected other nonstandard terms which Northern Trust would not offer in\nnon-troubled situations.\nThe following table provides, by segment and class, the number of TDR modifications of loans entered into during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, and the recorded investments and unpaid principal balances as of December 31, 2022.\nTABLE 69: TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS\nUNPAID\nNUMBER OF RECORDED PRINCIPAL\n($ In Millions) LOAN MODIFICATION DETAIL LOANS INVESTMENT BALANCE\nDecember 31, 2022\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional Interest rate concession, extension of term, and other 2 $ 0.6 $ 0.6\nmodification\nCommercial Real Estate Interest rate concession and other modification 1 31.6 32.5\nTotal Commercial 3 32.2 33.1\nPersonal\nResidential Real Estate Interest rate concession, deferrals of principal, extension of 3 0.2 0.2\nterm, and other modification\nPrivate Client Interest rate concession and extension of term 1 0.4 0.4\nTotal Personal 4 0.6 0.6\nTotal Loans 7 $ 32.8 $ 33.7\nNote: Period-end balances reflect all paydowns and charge-offs during the year.\nThere were no loan TDR modifications during the previous twelve-month period which subsequently had a payment\ndefault during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNote 6 – Allowance for Credit Losses\nAllowance and Provision for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best\nestimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit\nexposures, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process.\nNorthern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A\nfinancial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the\nrelated allowance is determined through an individual evaluation.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 127\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent\non any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables and\ntakes into consideration past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The primary forecast\nprovides for continued slow, but steady, economic growth, with inflation, unemployment and interest rates gradually\nreturning to their longer-run norms. An alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates\nthe experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles.\nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss\nReserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic\nResearch Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. The Credit Loss Reserve Committee\ndetermines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by Northern Trust’s Macroeconomic Scenario\nDevelopment Committee, and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with\nNorthern Trust’s qualitative adjustment framework.\nThe following table provides information regarding changes in the total allowance for credit losses.\nTABLE 70: CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n2023\nUNDRAWN LOAN\nCOMMITMENTS HELD TO OTHER\nAND STANDBY MATURITY DEBT FINANCIAL\n(In Millions) LOANS LETTERS OF CREDIT SECURITIES ASSETS TOTAL\nBalance at Beginning of Period $ 144.3 $ 38.5 $ 16.0 $ 0.8 $ 199.6\nCharge-Offs (7.5) — (1.2) — (8.7)\nRecoveries 3.7 — — — 3.7\nNet Recoveries (Charge-Offs) (3.8) — (1.2) — (5.0)\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses(1) 38.2 (11.6) (2.1) 0.1 24.6\nBalance at End of Period $ 178.7 $ 26.9 $ 12.7 $ 0.9 $ 219.2\n(1) The table excludes a release of credit reserves of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 for AFS debt securities.

The provision for loans was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis,\nwhich relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The increase was primarily seen in the\ncommercial real estate portfolio, driven by an increase in the size and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic\nprojections for the industry, methodology updates, and credit quality deterioration on a small number of loans during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The release of credit reserves in undrawn loan commitments and letters of credit during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 is primarily in the commercial and institutional portfolio, reflecting a combination of credit\nquality improvements, an improved macroeconomic outlook for that segment, and methodology updates. There were net\ncharge-offs of $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to net recoveries of $4.2 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.

The Allowance for Credit Losses related to Other Financial Assets was $0.9 million and $0.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccrued Interest. Accrued interest balances are reported within Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Northern\nTrust elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables related to its loan and securities\nportfolios as its policy is to write-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. Accrued interest\nis written off by reversing interest income during the period the financial asset is moved from an accrual to a nonaccrual\nstatus.\nThe following table provides the amount of accrued interest excluded from the amortized cost basis of the following\nportfolios.\nTABLE 74: ACCRUED INTEREST\n(In Millions) DECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nLoans $ 241.7 $ 203.1\nDebt Securities\nHeld to Maturity 72.0 63.2\nAvailable for Sale 129.2 147.1\nOther Financial Assets 86.0 43.8\nTotal $ 528.9 $ 457.2\nAccrued interest in 2023 increased compared to 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates. The amount of accrued\ninterest reversed through interest income for loans and securities was immaterial during the years ended 2023 and 2022.\nNote 7 – Concentrations of Credit Risk\nConcentrations of credit risk exist if a number of borrowers or other counterparties are engaged in similar activities and\nhave similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected\nby changes in economic or other conditions. The fact that a credit exposure falls into one of these groups does not\nnecessarily indicate that the credit has a higher than normal degree of credit risk. These groups are: banks and bank holding\ncompanies, residential real estate, and commercial real estate.\nBanks and Bank Holding Companies. At December 31, 2023, on-balance sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding\ncompanies, both U.S. and non-U.S., consisted primarily of Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks of $1.9 billion, demand\nbalances maintained at correspondent banks of $4.7 billion and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell of $0.8\nbillion. At December 31, 2022, on-balance sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies, both U.S. and non-U.S.,\nconsisted primarily of Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks of $1.9 billion, demand balances maintained at correspondent\nbanks of $4.6 billion, and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell of $1.1 billion. Credit risk associated with U.S.\nand non-U.S. banks and bank holding companies deemed to be counterparties by Credit Risk Management is managed by\nthe Capital Markets Credit Committee. Credit limits are established through a review process that includes an internally-\nprepared financial analysis, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external ratings from rating agencies.\nNorthern Trust places deposits with banks that have strong internal and external credit ratings and the average life to\nmaturity of deposits with banks is maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit\nconditions.\nResidential Real Estate. Residential real estate loans totaled $6.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and $6.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022, representing 14% and 16%, respectively, of total U.S. loans. Residential real estate loans consist of\ntraditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value ratio of 65% to\n80% at inception. Revaluations of supporting collateral are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise\nconsidered warranted. Collateral revaluations for mortgages are performed by independent third parties. Legally binding\nundrawn commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled $804.2 million\nand $783.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

In managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as\none where: (1) the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial\npurposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow\nfrom the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as\na normal and ongoing part of the business. Unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real\nestate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of\ncommercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors\nwell known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service\ncoverage requirements. Recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also generally required. Commercial mortgage\nfinancing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties\ngenerally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the California, Illinois, Florida, Texas,\nand New York markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior\nto rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a\ncommercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion. At December 31, 2023, legally\nbinding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled $413.0\nmillion and $82.1 million, respectively.

Custody and Fund Administration income is comprised of revenues\nreceived from our core asset servicing business for providing custody, fund administration, and middle-office-related\nservices, primarily to Asset Servicing clients. Investment Management and Advisory income contains revenue received\nfrom providing asset management and related services to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients and to Northern\nTrust sponsored funds. Securities Lending income represents revenues generated from securities lending arrangements that\nNorthern Trust enters into as agent, mainly with Asset Servicing clients. Other income largely consists of revenues\nreceived from providing employee benefit, investment risk and analytic and other services to Asset Servicing and Wealth\nManagement clients.\nOther Noninterest Income. Treasury Management income represents revenues received from providing cash and liquidity\nmanagement services to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients. The portion of Security Commissions and\nTrading Income that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is primarily comprised of commissions earned from\nproviding securities brokerage services to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients. The portion of Other Operating\nIncome that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is mainly comprised of service fees for banking-related services\nprovided to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients.\nPerformance Obligations. Clients are typically charged monthly or quarterly in arrears based on the fee arrangement\nagreed to with each client; payment terms will vary depending on the client and services offered.\nSubstantially all revenues generated from contracts with clients for asset servicing, asset management, securities\nlending, treasury management and banking-related services are recognized on an accrual basis, over the period in which\nservices are provided. The nature of Northern Trust’s performance obligations is to provide a series of distinct services in\nwhich the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the promised services as they are performed. Fee\narrangements are mainly comprised of variable amounts based on market value of client assets managed and serviced,\ntransaction volumes, number of accounts, and securities lending volume and spreads. Revenue is recognized using the\noutput method in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Northern Trust expects to be entitled in exchange for\nproviding each month or quarter of service. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to\neach performance obligation based on the price agreed to with the client, representing its relative standalone selling price.\nSecurity brokerage revenue is primarily represented by securities commissions received in exchange for providing\ntrade execution related services. Control is transferred at a point in time, on the trade date of the transaction, and fees are\ntypically variable based on transaction volumes and security types.\n140 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNorthern Trust’s contracts with its clients are typically open-ended arrangements and are therefore considered to have\nan original duration of less than one year.

Under the final rule, the assessment base for the\nspecial assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured domestic office deposits reported as\nof December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured domestic office deposits. The final rule provides\nthat the FDIC will collect the special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points over eight quarterly assessment\nperiods, subject to change depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers, failures, or amendments to reported\nestimates of uninsured deposits. In conjunction with the special assessment, $84.6 million was recognized as an accrued\nliability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023. The final rule becomes effective on April 1, 2024, and the first\ncollection, including any adjustments as described above, will be reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment\nperiod of 2024, with the first payment due on June 28, 2024.\nNote 20 – Income Taxes\nThe following table reconciles the statutory federal tax rate with the effective tax rate for the periods presented below.\nTABLE 98: INCOME TAXES\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nStatutory Federal Tax Rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState Taxes, net 3.4 3.3 3.4\nForeign Tax Rate Differential 0.6 0.1 0.1\nExcess Tax Benefit Related to Share-Based Compensation (0.1) (0.2) (0.4)\nTax Credits (2.7) (2.0) (1.6)\nTax Exempt Income (1.4) (0.9) (0.6)\nValuation Allowance 1.8 1.5 0.6\nOther, net 1.8 1.6 0.6\nEffective Tax Rate 24.4 % 24.4 % 23.1 %\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $357.5 million, $430.3 million, and\n$464.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4%, 24.4%, and 23.1% respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a higher net\nimpact from international operations, including limitations on the U.S. foreign tax credit and reserves for uncertain tax\npositions, partially offset by increased tax benefits from tax-credit investments and tax-exempt income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the lower net tax\nimpact from international operations and $26.8 million of prior-year tax expense related to the reversal of tax benefits\npreviously recognized through earnings.\nThe Corporation files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, and foreign jurisdictions. The Corporation is\nno longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal authorities before 2015, U.S. state or local tax authorities for\nyears before 2011, or non-U.S. tax authorities for years before 2014.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 143\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncluded in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $60.7 million\nand $40.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively.

Northern Trust has a\nnonqualified trust, referred to as a “Rabbi” Trust, used to hold assets designated for the funding of benefits in excess of\nthose permitted in certain of its qualified retirement plans. This arrangement offers participants a degree of assurance for\npayment of benefits in excess of those permitted in the related qualified plans. As the “Rabbi” Trust assets remain subject\nto the claims of creditors and are not the property of the employees, they are accounted for as corporate assets and are\nincluded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Total assets in the “Rabbi” Trust related to the nonqualified\npension plan at December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $90.3 million and $92.3 million, respectively. Contributions of\n$16.5 million and $20.7 million were made to the “Rabbi” Trust in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following tables set forth the status, amounts included in AOCI, and net periodic pension expense of the U.S.\nQualified Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and U.S. Non-Qualified Plan.

Therefore, Northern\nTrust recognized settlement charges related to its U.S. Qualified Plan in the second, third, and fourth quarter of both 2022\nand 2021, which required interim remeasurements of the U.S. Qualified Plan as of each respective quarter-end. The\nsettlement charge represents the pro rata amount of the net loss in AOCI that is charged to income based on the proportion\nof the Projected Benefit Obligation settled to the total Projected Benefit Obligation and amounted to a total of $44.1 million\nand $27.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe components of net periodic pension expense are included in Employee Benefits expense on the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nTABLE 106: CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION\nU.S. QUALIFIED PLAN NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PLAN\n(In Millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\nBeginning Balance $ 1,077.7 $ 1,401.3 $ 129.0 $ 210.1 $ 113.6 $ 147.7\nService Cost 46.0 48.0 1.6 1.7 4.8 5.6\nInterest Cost 53.9 46.3 4.8 2.5 5.3 3.9\nEmployee Contributions — — 0.8 0.7 — —\nPlan Amendment — — (0.2) (0.3) — —\nActuarial Loss (Gain) 36.8 (281.2) 8.1 (64.3) 8.4 (20.0)\nSettlements — (125.0) — (0.9) — —\nBenefits Paid (62.7) (11.7) (4.1) (4.6) (22.9) (23.6)\nForeign Exchange Rate Changes — — 8.6 (15.9) — —\nEnding Balance $ 1,151.7 $ 1,077.7 $ 148.6 $ 129.0 $ 109.2 $ 113.6\nActuarial losses of $53.3 million in 2023 were primarily caused by decreases in discount rates, while actuarial gains of\n$365.5 million in 2022 were primarily caused by substantial increases in discount rates.\nTABLE 107: ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS\n(In Millions) U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN NON-U.S.PENSION PLANS U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PLAN\n2024 $ 95.7 $ 6.2 $ 15.8\n2025 99.6 4.7 16.1\n2026 98.9 5.5 13.4\n2027 101.2 6.5 11.2\n2028 98.6 6.8 11.2\n2029-2033 487.6 35.3 49.8\nTABLE 108: CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS\nU.S. QUALIFIED PLAN NON-U.S PENSION PLANS\n(In Millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nFair Value of Assets at Beginning of Period $ 1,176.8 $ 1,708.9 $ 134.5 $ 198.7\nActual Return on Assets 86.8 (395.4) 5.0 (46.9)\nEmployer Contributions — — 3.9 3.6\nEmployee Contributions — — 0.8 0.7\nSettlements — (125.0) — (0.9)\nBenefits Paid (62.8) (11.7) (4.1) (4.6)\nForeign Exchange Rate Changes — — 8.6 (16.1)\nFair Value of Assets at End of Period $ 1,200.8 $ 1,176.8 $ 148.7 $ 134.5\nThe minimum required and maximum deductible contributions for the U.S. Qualified Plan in 2024 are estimated to be\nzero and $420.0 million, respectively. The remaining 2024 maximum deductible contribution, after considering a cash\ncontribution of $200.0 million made to the U.S. Qualified Plan during January 2024, is estimated at $220.0 million.\nThe investment strategy employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan utilizes a dynamic glide path based on a\nset of pre-approved asset allocations to return-seeking and liability-hedging assets that vary in accordance with the U.S.\nQualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio. In general, as the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 147\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nobligation funded ratio increases beyond an established threshold, the U.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging\nassets will increase while the allocation to return-seeking assets will decrease. Conversely, a decrease in the U.S. Qualified\nPlan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio beyond an established threshold will generally result in a decrease in the\nU.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets and increase in the allocation to return-seeking assets. Liability-\nhedging assets include U.S. long credit bonds, U.S. long government bonds, and a custom completion strategy used to\nhedge more closely the liability duration of projected plan benefits with bond duration across all durations. Return-seeking\nassets include: U.S. equity, international developed equity, emerging markets equity, real estate, high yield bonds, global\nlisted infrastructure, emerging market debt, private equity and hedge funds. During 2022, the funded ratio fell below the\nthreshold and in early 2023 the asset allocation of the U.S. Qualified Plan was adjusted to a stage of the glide path which\nallows for a greater component of return-seeking assets.\nNorthern Trust utilizes an asset/liability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short\nand long-term objectives. The process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation,\nfunding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions. The financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market\nreturns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of\nmeeting the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment objectives. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the\nU.S. Qualified Plan liabilities, funded status, and corporate financial condition. The intent of this strategy is to protect the\nU.S. Qualified Plan’s funded status and generate returns, which in combination with voluntary contributions are expected\nto outpace the U.S. Qualified Plan’s liability growth over the long run.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the target allocation of the U.S. Qualified Plan assets consisted of 45% U.S. long credit\nbonds, 20% global equities (developed and emerging markets), 10% custom completion, 5% private equity, 5% high yield\nbonds, 4% emerging market debt, 4% global listed infrastructure, 4% private real estate, and 3% hedge funds.\nGlobal equity investments include common stocks that are listed on an exchange and investments in commingled\nfunds that invest primarily in publicly traded equities. Equity investments are diversified across country, region, investment\nstyle and market capitalization. Fixed income securities held include U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, and\ninvestments in commingled funds that invest in a diversified blend of longer duration fixed income securities; the custom\ncompletion strategy uses U.S. treasury securities and interest rate futures (or similar instruments) to align more closely with\nthe target hedge ratio across maturities. Diversifying investments, including private equity, hedge funds, private real estate,\nemerging market debt, high yield bonds, and global listed infrastructure, are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns\nwhile improving portfolio diversification. Private equity assets consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships that\ninvest in individual companies in the form of non-public equity or non-public debt positions. Direct or co-investment in\nnon-public stock by the U.S. Qualified Plan is prohibited. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s private equity investments are limited\nto 20% of each of the total limited partnership or fund of funds and the maximum allowable loss cannot exceed the\ncommitment amount. The U.S. Qualified Plan invests in one hedge fund of funds, which invests, either directly or\nindirectly, in diversified portfolios of funds or other pooled investment vehicles.\nInvestments in private real estate, high yield bonds, emerging market debt, and global listed infrastructure are designed\nto provide income and added diversification.\nDerivatives may be used, depending on the nature of the asset class to which they relate, to gain market exposure in an\nefficient and timely manner, to hedge foreign currency exposure or interest rate risk, or to alter the duration of a portfolio.\nThere were four derivatives held by the U.S. Qualified Plan at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInvestment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements, periodic\nasset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Standards used to evaluate the U.S. Qualified Plan’s\ninvestment manager performance include, but are not limited to, the achievement of objectives, operation within guidelines\nand policy, and comparison against a benchmark. In addition, each manager of the investment funds held by the U.S.\nQualified Plan is ranked against a universe of peers and compared to a benchmark. Total U.S. Qualified Plan performance\nanalysis includes an analysis of the market environment, asset allocation impact on performance, risk and return relative to\nother ERISA plans, and manager impacts upon U.S. Qualified Plan performance.\nThe following describes the hierarchy of inputs used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies\nused by Northern Trust for the U.S. Qualified Plan assets measured at fair value.\nLevel 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 assets are\ncomprised primarily of mutual funds and domestic common stocks. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 investments that are\nexchange traded are valued at the closing price reported by the respective exchanges on the day of valuation.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in active markets. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 2 assets are comprised of collective\ntrust funds, corporate bonds, government obligations, and municipal and provincial bonds. The investments in collective\ntrust funds fair values are calculated on a scheduled basis using the closing market prices and accruals of securities in the\n148 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfunds (total value of the funds) divided by the number of fund shares currently issued and outstanding. Redemptions of the\ncollective trust funds occur by contract at the respective fund’s redemption date net asset value (NAV).\nLevel 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace. The\nU.S. Qualified Plan did not hold Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAssets valued at fair value using NAV per share - The U.S. Qualified Plan’s assets valued at fair value using NAV\nper share include investments in private equity funds and a hedge fund, which invest in underlying groups of investment\nfunds or other pooled investment vehicles that are selected by the respective funds’ investment managers. The investment\nfunds and the underlying investments held by these investment funds are valued at fair value. In determining the fair value\nof the underlying investments of each fund, the fund’s investment manager or general partner takes into account the\nestimated value reported by the underlying funds as well as any other considerations that may, in their judgment, increase\nor decrease such estimated value. The investments in the private equity funds and a hedge fund are considered to be long-\nterm investments. There are no capital withdrawal options related to the investments in the private equity funds. However,\ncapital is periodically distributed as underlying investments are sold. It is estimated that the current private equity\ninvestments would be liquidated over 1 to 15 years, depending on the vintage year of a particular fund. With sixty days\nadvance notice, the Plan’s investment in the hedge fund can be withdrawn at the next calendar quarter end.\nThe U.S. Qualified Plan’s assets valued at fair value using NAV per share also include investments in real estate funds,\nwhich invest in real estate assets. The investment in properties by the real estate funds are carried at fair value, which is\nestimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace\nparticipants at the measurement date. The valuation plan for each real estate investment is subject to review on an annual\nbasis which is based on either an external appraisal from appraisal firms or internal valuations prepared by the real estate\nfund’s investment advisor. The Plan’s investment in real estate funds are considered to be long-term investments and, with\nforty-five days advance notice, can be withdrawn at the next calendar quarter end to the extent the real estate funds have\nliquid assets.\nAs investments in the private equity funds, hedge fund, and real estate fund are valued at fair value using NAV per\nshare, they are not required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nWhile Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for U.S. Qualified Plan assets are appropriate and consistent with\nother market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could have a material effect on the\ncomputation of the estimated fair values.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 149\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan assets, by major asset category,\nand their level within the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 109: FAIR VALUE OF U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\n(In Millions) LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL\nDomestic Common Stock $ 16.6 $ — $ — $ 16.6\nForeign Common Stock 0.3 — — 0.3\nDomestic Corporate Bonds — 218.2 — 218.2\nForeign Corporate Bonds — 33.6 — 33.6\nU.S. Government Obligations — 87.5 — 87.5\nNon-U.S. Government Obligations — 14.0 — 14.0\nDomestic Municipal and Provincial Bonds — 17.2 — 17.2\nForeign Municipal and Provincial Bonds — 0.3 — 0.3\nCollective Trust Funds — 571.5 — 571.5\nMutual Funds 80.3 — — 80.3\nCash and Other(1) (3.4) — — (3.4)\nTotal Assets at Fair Value in the Fair Value Hierarchy $ 93.8 $ 942.3 $ — $ 1,036.1\nAssets Valued at NAV per share\nNorthern Trust Private Equity Funds 45.6\nNorthern Trust Hedge Fund 36.2\nReal Estate Funds 82.9\nTotal Assets at Fair Value $ 1,200.8\n(1) Negative balance in Cash and Other as of December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the timing of transfers between cash accounts and short-term investment funds presented\nin Collective Trust Funds.\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\n(In Millions) LEVEL 1 LEVEL 2 LEVEL 3 TOTAL\nDomestic Common Stock $ 14.7 $ — $ — $ 14.7\nForeign Common Stock 0.5 — — 0.5\nDomestic Corporate Bonds — 263.6 — 263.6\nForeign Corporate Bonds — 39.6 — 39.6\nU.S. Government Obligations — 77.5 — 77.5\nNon-U.S. Government Obligations — 13.8 — 13.8\nDomestic Municipal and Provincial Bonds — 16.8 — 16.8\nForeign Municipal and Provincial Bonds — 0.2 — 0.2\nCollective Trust Funds — 522.3 — 522.3\nMutual Funds 61.4 — — 61.4\nCash and Other(1) (1.1) — — (1.1)\nTotal Assets at Fair Value in the Fair Value Hierarchy $ 75.5 $ 933.8 $ — $ 1,009.3\nAssets Valued at NAV per share\nNorthern Trust Private Equity Funds 33.2\nNorthern Trust Hedge Fund 35.2\nReal Estate Funds 99.1\nTotal Assets at Fair Value $ 1,176.8\n(1) Negative balance in Cash and Other as of December 31, 2022 primarily relates to due to broker for securities purchased.\nA building block approach is employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan in determining the long-term rate of return\nfor plan assets. Historical markets and long-term historical relationships between equities, fixed income and other asset\nclasses are studied using the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater\nreturn over the long-run. Current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before long-\nterm capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio rate of return is established with consideration\ngiven to diversification and rebalancing. The rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is\nreasonable and appropriate. Based on this approach and the U.S. Qualified Plan’s target asset allocation, the expected long-\nterm rate of return on assets as of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s December 31, 2023 measurement date was set at 7.25%.\n150 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDefined Contribution Plans.

The restricted stock units granted in 2023 predominately vest at a rate equal to 25% per year for four years\non the first day of the month following the month in which the grant date falls. Restricted stock unit grants totaled\n1,166,376, 1,061,573, and 846,433, with weighted average grant-date fair values of $91.56, $110.99, and $99.31 per share,\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, was $85.9 million, $75.6 million, and $89.4 million,\nrespectively.\nA summary of the status of outstanding restricted stock unit awards at December 31, 2023, and changes during the\nyear then ended, is presented in the following table.\nTABLE 113: OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS\nAGGREGATE\n($ In Millions) NUMBER INTRINSIC VALUE\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards Outstanding, December 31, 2022 2,243,183 $ 198.5\nGranted 1,166,376\nDistributed (847,281)\nForfeited or Cancelled (62,220)\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards Outstanding, December 31, 2023 2,500,058 $ 211.0\nUnits Convertible, December 31, 2023 18,887 $ 1.6\n152 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following is a summary of nonvested restricted stock unit awards at December 31, 2023, and changes during the year\nthen ended.\nTABLE 114: NONVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE WEIGHTED AVERAGE\nNONVESTED RESTRICTED GRANT- DATE FAIR REMAINING VESTING\nSTOCK UNITS NUMBER VALUE PER UNIT TERM (YEARS)\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 2,223,657 $ 103.41 2.4\nGranted 1,166,376 91.56\nVested (846,642) 101.38\nForfeited or Cancelled (62,220) 99.66\nNonvested at December 31, 2023 2,481,171 $ 98.62 2.4\nPerformance Stock Units. Each performance stock unit provides the recipient the opportunity to receive one share of the\nCorporation’s common stock for each stock unit based on the attainment of certain performance criteria over a three-year\nperiod. For performance stock unit awards granted in 2021, 2022 and 2023, the number of units that will vest are subject to\nthe attainment of specified performance targets that are a function of average return on equity goals and average return on\nequity performance relative to that of a performance peer group, each measured over a three-year period. For performance\nstock units outstanding as of December 31, 2023, the number of performance stock units that will vest ranges from 0% to\n150% of the original award granted based on the achievement of both absolute and relative return on equity goals over a\nthree-year period compared to performance targets. Distribution of the shares is then made after vesting.\nPerformance stock unit grants totaled 219,314, 211,906, and 204,539 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively, with weighted average grant-date fair values of $93.97, $113.64, and $97.77. Performance stock\nunits outstanding at target level performance totaled 613,450, 607,892, and 622,817 at December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively. Performance stock units had aggregate intrinsic values of $51.8 million, $53.8 million, and $74.5\nmillion, and weighted average remaining vesting terms of 1.0 year each at December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively.\nNon-employee Director Stock Awards. Stock units with total values of $1.6 million (20,405 units), $1.6 million (14,773\nunits), and $1.5 million (13,968 units) were granted to non-employee directors in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively,\nwhich vest or vested on the date of the annual meeting of the Corporation’s stockholders in the following years. Total\nexpense recognized on these grants was $1.7 million, $1.7 million, and $1.6 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock units granted to non-employee directors do not have voting rights. Each stock unit entitles a director to one share of\ncommon stock at vesting, unless a director elects to defer receipt of the shares. Directors may elect to defer the payment of\ntheir annual stock unit grant and cash-based compensation until termination of services as director. Deferred cash\ncompensation is converted into stock units representing shares of common stock of the Corporation. Distributions of\ndeferred stock units are made in stock. For compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2018, distributions of the stock unit\naccounts that relate to cash-based compensation are made in cash based on the fair value of the stock units at the time of\ndistribution. For compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2018, distributions of the stock unit accounts that relate to\ncash-based compensation are made in stock.\nNote 23 – Cash-Based Compensation Plans\nVarious incentive plans provide for cash incentives and bonuses to selected employees based upon accomplishment\nof corporate net income objectives, goals of the reporting segments and support functions, and individual performance. The\nprovision for awards under these plans is charged to Compensation expense and totaled $358.7 million in 2023, $392.7\nmillion in 2022, and $377.1 million in 2021.\nNote 24 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments, Guarantees and Other Commitments. Northern Trust, in the normal course\nof business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit\nenhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the maximum potential credit\nexposure should the instrument be fully drawn upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with\nentering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality\nand monitoring controls as its lending activities. Northern Trust does not believe the total contractual amount of these\ninstruments to be representative of its future credit exposure or funding requirements.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 153\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides details of Northern Trust's off-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 115: SUMMARY OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDECEMBER 31,\n2023 2022\nONE YEAR OVER ONE ONE YEAR OVER ONE\n(In Millions) AND LESS YEAR TOTAL AND LESS YEAR TOTAL\nUndrawn Commitments(1) $ 11,849.5 $ 18,909.6 $ 30,759.1 $ 13,639.2 $ 17,321.4 $ 30,960.6\nStandby Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees(2)(3) 85,752.0 639.0 86,391.0 17,553.0 409.9 17,962.9\nCommercial Letters of Credit 29.2 1.3 30.5 25.4 1.3 26.7\nSecurities Lent with Indemnification 140,539.1 — 140,539.1 130,311.0 — 130,311.0\nUnsettled Reverse Repurchase Agreements 27,667.7 — 27,667.7 496.8 — 496.8\nTotal Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments $ 265,837.5 $ 19,549.9 $ 285,387.4 $ 162,025.4 $ 17,732.6 $ 179,758.0\n(1) These amounts exclude $222.2 million and $266.6 million of commitments participated to others at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(2) These amounts include $39.1 million and $35.1 million of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n(3) This amount includes a $84.6 billion guarantee to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) under the sponsored member program, without taking into consideration\nthe related collateral, as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there was a $16.3 billion guarantee to the FICC; Northern Trust became a sponsored member\nduring the third quarter of 2021.\nUndrawn Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion\nof the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily\nrepresent future loans or liquidity requirements.\nStandby Letters of Credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the\ncontractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public\nand private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures\nexchanges, and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements\nand in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants.\nSince the vast majority of the standby letters of credit are never drawn, the total standby letters of credit amount does not\nnecessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements.\nFinancial Guarantees are issued by Northern Trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under\ncertain arrangements.\nCommercial Letters of Credit are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third\nparty (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement\nand other similar instruments. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.\nSecurities Lent with Indemnification involves Northern Trust lending securities owned by clients to borrowers who\nare reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee, as part of its securities custody\nactivities and at the direction of its clients. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications\nto certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should\nthe value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to fully\ncollateralize securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a\nminimum of 100% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The\namount of securities loaned subject to indemnification as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, was $140.5\nbillion and $130.3 billion, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully\ncollateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant\nand no liability was recorded at December 31, 2023, or 2022 related to these indemnifications.\nUnsettled Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. Northern Trust enters into repurchase agreements and\nreverse repurchase agreements which may settle at a future date. In repurchase agreements, Northern Trust receives cash\nfrom and provides securities as collateral to a counterparty. In reverse repurchase agreements, Northern Trust advances\ncash to and receives securities as collateral from a counterparty. These transactions are recorded on the consolidated\nbalance sheets on the settlement date. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, there were $27.7 billion and $496.8 million of\nunsettled reverse repurchase agreements, and no unsettled repurchase agreements, respectively.\nSponsored Member Program. Northern Trust is an approved Government Securities Division (GSD) netting and\nsponsoring member in the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) sponsored member program, through which\nNorthern Trust submits eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. government securities between\nNorthern Trust and its sponsored member clients for novation and clearing. Northern Trust may sponsor clients to clear\n154 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ntheir eligible repurchase transactions with the FICC. As a sponsoring member, Northern Trust guarantees to the FICC the\nprompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC GSD’s\nrules. To mitigate Northern Trust’s credit exposure under this guarantee, Northern Trust obtains a security interest in its\nsponsored member clients’ collateral. Please refer to Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities” for additional\ninformation on Northern Trust’s repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\nClearing and Settlement Organizations. The Bank is a participating member of various cash, securities and foreign\nexchange clearing and settlement organizations. It participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own\nbehalf as a result of its own activities. A wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these\norganizations, including those involving U.S. Treasuries, obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed\nsecurities, commercial paper, dollar placements, and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association.\nCertain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and\nliabilities and/or to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations as stipulated in each\nclearing organization’s membership agreement. Exposure related to these agreements varies, primarily as a result of\nfluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Northern\nTrust has not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements as Northern Trust believes the likelihood that a\nclearing or settlement exchange (of which Northern Trust is a member) would become insolvent is remote. Controls related\nto these clearing transactions are closely monitored by management to protect the assets of Northern Trust and its clients.\nLegal Proceedings. In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in\nor parties to pending and threatened legal actions, and are subject to regulatory examinations, information-gathering\nrequests, investigations, and proceedings, both formal and informal. In certain legal actions, claims for substantial\nmonetary damages are asserted. In regulatory matters, claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial\nactions or sanctions may be sought.\nBased on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals,\nmanagement does not believe that losses, fines or penalties, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal\nactions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance\ncoverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although\nsuch matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results for a particular period.\nUnder GAAP, (i) an event is “probable” if the “future event or events are likely to occur”; (ii) an event is “reasonably\npossible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely”; and (iii) an event\nis “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.”\nThe outcome of litigation and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot\nbe reasonably estimated, particularly for matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve\nuncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or\nmotions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not\nspecify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability\nlegal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the\ntiming of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will\nbe.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory\nmatters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss\ncontingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals. No material\naccruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters.\nFor a limited number of matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of an\naccrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. As\nof December 31, 2023, the Corporation has estimated the range of reasonably possible loss for these matters to be from\nzero to approximately $25 million in the aggregate. The Corporation’s estimate with respect to the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety\nof assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time\nto time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nIn certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss\nin excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not\nincluded in the estimated range of reasonably possible loss discussed above.\nIn 2015, Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, was\ncharged by a French investigating magistrate judge with complicity in estate tax fraud in connection with the\nadministration of two trusts for which it serves as trustee. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 155\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nentities related to this matter. In 2017, a French court found no estate tax fraud had occurred and NTFS and all other\npersons and entities charged were acquitted. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of France appealed the court decision and in\nJune 2018 a French appellate court issued its opinion on the matter, acquitting all persons and entities charged, including\nNTFS. In January 2021, the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in France, reversed the June 2018 appellate court ruling,\nrequiring a re-trial at the appellate court level. This re-trial concluded in October 2023 and the appellate court is expected\nto render its verdict in March 2024. As trustee, NTFS provided no tax advice and had no involvement in the preparation or\nfiling of the challenged estate tax filings.\nVisa Class B Common Shares. Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection\nwith the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received\ncertain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions until the\nfinal resolution of certain litigation related to interchange fees involving Visa (the covered litigation), at which time the\nshares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of\nresolving the covered litigation. Since 2018, Visa has deposited an additional $2.8 billion into an escrow account\npreviously established with respect to the covered litigation. As a result of the additional contributions to the escrow\naccount, the rate at which Visa Class B common shares will convert into Visa Class A common shares was reduced to\n1.5875 as of December 31, 2023.\nIn September 2018, Visa reached a proposed class settlement agreement covering damage claims but not injunctive\nrelief claims regarding the covered litigation. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval for the proposed\nclass settlement agreement. In March 2023, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s approval of\nthe class settlement agreement. Certain merchants have opted out of the class settlement and are pursuing claims\nseparately. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation, the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa\nClass B common shares and the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares are\nuncertain.\nOn January 29, 2024, Visa filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC. This\nregistration statement has not yet become effective. If Visa commences the exchange offer contemplated by the registration\nstatement, Visa Class B shareholders would have the option to tender some or all of their Class B shares and in return\nreceive shares of a newly issued series of Visa Class B common shares with a value equal to half the value of the tendered\nshares and Visa Class C common shares with value equal to the other half of the tendered shares. The newly issued series\nof Visa Class B common shares would be subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions as the currently\noutstanding Visa Class B common shares. One third of the Visa Class C common shares received would be transferable\nwithin the first 45 days following the potential exchange, up to two-thirds would be transferable within the first 90 days,\nand all such shares would be transferable after 90 days. The Visa Class C common shares will automatically be converted\nat the then applicable conversion rate into shares of Visa Class A common stock if transferred to a person other than a Visa\nmember or an affiliate of a Visa member. After the initial exchange offer, Visa could, at its discretion, conduct up to three\nsuccessive potential exchange offers, in each case, if more than 12 months have passed since the previous exchange offer\nand after a further 50% reduction of interchange fees at issue in the unresolved claims for damages in the covered\nlitigation.\nIn June 2016 and 2015, Northern Trust recorded a $123.1 million and $99.9 million net gain on the sale of 1.1 million\nand 1.0 million of its Visa Class B common shares, respectively. These sales do not affect Northern Trust’s risk related to\nthe impact of the covered litigation on the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common\nshares. Northern Trust continued to hold approximately 4.1 million Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at\ntheir original cost basis of zero, as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 25 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nNorthern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet\nthe needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account; and as part of its risk management activities.\nThese instruments may include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts, and swaps\nrelated to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares. Please refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies” for the significant accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.\nForeign exchange contracts are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date, at a specified\nrate of exchange. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients.\nForeign exchange contracts are also used for trading and risk management purposes. For risk management purposes,\nNorthern Trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to\ncertain forecasted non-functional-currency-denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, foreign-currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities, including debt securities and net investments in non-U.S. affiliates.\n156 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInterest rate contracts include swap and option contracts. Interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed\nand floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Northern Trust\nenters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the\nexposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest\nrate option contracts may include caps, floors, collars and swaptions, and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest\nrate risk, typically in exchange for a fee. Northern Trust enters into option contracts primarily as a seller of interest rate\nprotection to clients. Northern Trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an\nunfavorable change in interest rates. This assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position\nwith an outside counterparty. Northern Trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management\npurposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table shows the notional and fair values of all derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nTABLE 116: NOTIONAL AND FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nFAIR VALUE FAIR VALUE\nNOTIONAL NOTIONAL\n(In Millions) VALUE ASSET(1) LIABILITY(2) VALUE ASSET(1) LIABILITY(2)\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging under GAAP\nInterest Rate Contracts\nFair Value Hedges $ 7,042.7 $ 94.7 $ 71.0 $ 4,622.0 $ 58.5 $ 32.7\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nCash Flow Hedges 1,453.6 15.0 42.2 150.9 7.4 5.7\nNet Investment Hedges 4,077.4 13.3 31.9 3,765.0 283.5 12.7\nTotal Derivatives Designated as Hedging under GAAP $ 12,573.7 $ 123.0 $ 145.1 $ 8,537.9 $ 349.4 $ 51.1\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP\nNon-Designated Risk Management Derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts $ 20.7 $ — $ 0.1 $ 55.9 $ 0.1 $ 0.1\nOther Financial Derivatives(3) 867.9 — 25.4 717.7 0.3 34.8\nTotal Non-Designated Risk Management Derivatives $ 888.6 $ — $ 25.5 $ 773.6 $ 0.4 $ 34.9\nClient-Related and Trading Derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts $ 313,336.9 $ 3,238.4 $ 3,181.0 $ 288,994.6 $ 3,219.1 $ 3,169.0\nInterest Rate Contracts 13,584.1 206.8 298.2 12,378.2 163.5 399.1\nTotal Client-Related and Trading Derivatives $ 326,921.0 $ 3,445.2 $ 3,479.2 $ 301,372.8 $ 3,382.6 $ 3,568.1\nTotal Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging under\nGAAP $ 327,809.6 $ 3,445.2 $ 3,504.7 $ 302,146.4 $ 3,383.0 $ 3,603.0\nTotal Gross Derivatives $ 340,383.3 $ 3,568.2 $ 3,649.8 $ 310,684.3 $ 3,732.4 $ 3,654.1\nLess: Netting(4) 3,126.7 2,205.4 2,810.7 1,865.9\nTotal Derivative Financial Instruments $ 441.5 $ 1,444.4 $ 921.7 $ 1,788.2\n(1) Derivative assets are reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Derivative liabilities are reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) This line includes swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares and total return swap contracts.\n(4) See further detail in Note 27, \"Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities.\"\nNotional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk, and are not recorded on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust’s credit-related risk of loss is\nlimited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, net of any collateral received, which is significantly less than\nthe notional amount.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 157\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nHedging Derivative Instruments Designated under GAAP. Northern Trust uses derivative instruments to hedge its\nexposure to foreign currency, interest rate, and equity price. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and\nqualify for hedge accounting under GAAP as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Other derivatives that are\nentered into for risk management purposes as economic hedges are not formally designated as hedges and changes in fair\nvalue are recognized currently in Other Operating Income within the consolidated statements of income (see below section\n“Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP”).\nFair Value Hedges. Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the\nfair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates.\nCash Flow Hedges. Derivatives are also designated as cash flow hedges in order to minimize the variability in cash flows\nof earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates.\nThere were no material gains or losses reclassified into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021 as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of\noccurring. It is estimated that net losses of $27.3 million will be reclassified into Net Income within the next twelve months\nrelating to cash flow hedges of foreign-currency-denominated debt securities. As of December 31, 2023, 4 months was the\nmaximum length of time over which the exposure to variability in future cash flows of forecasted foreign-currency-\ndenominated debt securities was being hedged.\nThe following table provides fair value and cash flow hedge derivative gains and losses recognized in income during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nTABLE 117: LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF FAIR VALUE AND CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED\nIN INCOME\nOTHER OPERATING\n(In Millions) INTEREST INCOME INTEREST EXPENSE INCOME\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nTotal amounts on the consolidated statements of income $ 7,325.0 $ 2,877.7 $ 1,406.5 $ 5,343.0 $ 990.5 $ 23.8 $ 228.7 $ 191.3 $ 243.9\nGains (Losses) on fair value hedges recognized on\nInterest Rate Contracts\nRecognized on derivatives (132.6) 82.8 39.1 74.9 (373.4) (161.6) — — —\nRecognized on hedged items 132.6 (82.8) (39.1) (74.9) 373.4 161.6 — — —\nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives 47.1 (4.4) (16.2) (86.5) 24.1 57.1 — — —\nTotal gains (losses) recognized on fair value hedges $ 47.1 $ (4.4) $ (16.2) $ (86.5) $ 24.1 $ 57.1 $ — $ — $ —\nGains (Losses) on cash flow hedges recognized on\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nNet gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to net\nincome $ 34.9 $ 0.6 $ 10.5 $ — $ — $ — $ 1.9 $ (4.3) $ (6.0)\nTotal gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to net\nincome on cash flow hedges $ 34.9 $ 0.6 $ 10.5 $ — $ — $ — $ 1.9 $ (4.3) $ (6.0)\n158 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the designated hedged\nitems, which includes hedged items no longer designated.\nTABLE 118: HEDGED ITEMS IN FAIR VALUE HEDGES\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nCARRYING VALUE CUMULATIVE HEDGE CUMULATIVE HEDGE\nOF THE HEDGED ACCOUNTING BASIS CARRYING VALUE OF ACCOUNTING BASIS\n(In Millions) ITEMS ADJUSTMENT(1)(3) THE HEDGED ITEMS ADJUSTMENT(2)(3)\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities(4) $ 5,048.8 $ 77.5 $ 1,820.8 $ (60.2)\nSenior Notes and Long-Term Subordinated Debt 2,495.9 (248.7) 2,746.2 (294.0)\n(1) The cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment includes $2.2 million related to discontinued hedging relationships of AFS debt securities and $29.6 million related to\ndiscontinued hedging relationships in the cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment of senior notes and long-term debt as of December 31, 2023.\n(2) The cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment includes $7.3 million related to discontinued hedging relationships of AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2022.

Certain foreign exchange contracts are designated as net investment hedges to minimize Northern\nTrust’s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries.\nNet investment hedge losses of $77.4 million and net investment hedge gains of $278.7 million were recognized in AOCI\nrelated to foreign exchange contracts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP. Northern Trust’s derivative instruments that are not\ndesignated as hedging under GAAP include derivatives for purposes of client-related and trading activities, as well as other\nrisk management purposes. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in\nconnection with Northern Trust’s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also\nengages in trading of currencies for its own account.\nNon-designated risk management derivatives include foreign exchange contracts entered into to manage the foreign\ncurrency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates,\ncommercial loans, and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class\nB common shares were entered into pursuant to which Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate\nconversion of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares. Total return swaps are entered into to\nmanage the equity price risk associated with certain investments.\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges under GAAP are recognized currently in\nincome.

To\nminimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is\nmonitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly\nassessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities\npurchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged\nto the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those\npurchased under resale agreements when there is a legally enforceable master netting arrangement and the other conditions\nto net are met.\nThe following tables summarize information related to Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities\nSold under Agreements to Repurchase.\nTABLE 120: SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at December 31 $ 784.7 $ 1,070.3\nAverage Balance During the Year 950.9 1,071.2\nAverage Interest Rate Earned During the Year 166.71 % 9.68 %\nMaximum Month-End Balance During the Year $ 1,326.2 $ 1,320.8\nNote: The table above includes the impact of balance sheet netting of approximately $29.1 billion and $3.6 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTABLE 121: SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022\nBalance at December 31 $ 784.7 $ 567.2\nAverage Balance During the Year 401.5 433.6\nAverage Interest Rate Paid During the Year 383.84 % 20.94 %\nMaximum Month-End Balance During the Year $ 988.1 $ 869.0\nNote: The table above includes the impact of balance sheet netting of approximately $29.1 billion and $3.6 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTABLE 122: REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED BORROWINGS\nREMAINING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF THE AGREEMENTS\nOVERNIGHT AND CONTINUOUS\n(In Millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nU.S. Treasury and Agency Securities $ 784.7 $ 567.2\nTotal Borrowings 784.7 567.2\nNet Amount of Recognized Liabilities for Repurchase Agreements in Note 27 784.7 567.2\n160 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 27 – Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table provides information regarding the offsetting of derivative assets and of securities purchased under\nagreements to resell within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 123: OFFSETTING OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nGROSS GROSS\nAMOUNTS NET AMOUNTS AMOUNTS\nGROSS OFFSET IN THE PRESENTED IN NOT OFFSET IN\nRECOGNIZED BALANCE THE BALANCE THE BALANCE\n(In Millions) ASSETS SHEET(3) SHEET SHEET(4) NET AMOUNT(5)\nDerivative Assets(1)\nForeign Exchange Contracts Over the Counter\n(OTC) $ 3,006.3 $ 2,937.2 $ 69.1 $ 12.2 $ 56.9\nInterest Rate Swaps OTC 301.4 189.5 111.9 — 111.9\nInterest Rate Swaps Exchange Cleared 0.1 — 0.1 — 0.1\nTotal Derivatives Subject to a Master Netting\nArrangement 3,307.8 3,126.7 181.1 12.2 168.9\nTotal Derivatives Not Subject to a Master Netting\nArrangement 260.4 — 260.4 — 260.4\nTotal Derivatives 3,568.2 3,126.7 441.5 12.2 429.3\nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell(2) $ 62,860.2 $ 62,075.5 $ 784.7 $ — $ 784.7\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nGROSS GROSS\nAMOUNTS NET AMOUNTS AMOUNTS\nGROSS OFFSET IN THE PRESENTED IN NOT OFFSET IN\nRECOGNIZED BALANCE THE BALANCE THE BALANCE\n(In Millions) ASSETS SHEET(3) SHEET SHEET(4) NET AMOUNT(5)\nDerivative Assets(1)\nForeign Exchange Contracts OTC $ 2,928.9 $ 2,666.4 $ 262.5 $ 5.0 $ 257.5\nInterest Rate Swaps OTC 217.6 144.3 73.3 — 73.3\nInterest Rate Swaps Exchange Cleared 4.4 — 4.4 — 4.4\nOther Financial Derivatives 0.3 — 0.3 — 0.3\nTotal Derivatives Subject to a Master Netting\nArrangement 3,151.2 2,810.7 340.5 5.0 335.5\nTotal Derivatives Not Subject to a Master Netting\nArrangement 581.2 — 581.2 — 581.2\nTotal Derivatives 3,732.4 2,810.7 921.7 5.0 916.7\nSecurities Purchased under Agreements to Resell(2) $ 12,494.2 $ 11,423.9 $ 1,070.3 $ 1,070.3 $ —\n(1) Derivative assets are reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

In the event of a repurchase failure,\nthe cash or financial assets are available for offset. All of Northern Trust’s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase\nagreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and\noffset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed\nwith a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can\nbe offset against receivables from that counterparty. Northern Trust has elected to net securities sold under repurchase\nagreements against those purchased under resale agreements when the GAAP requirements to net are met.\nDerivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further\noffset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that,\nupon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative\nreceivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not\nrepresent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors. Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets\n162 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust\nand the counterparty.\nCredit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern\nTrust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and\nlosses on these instruments, net of any collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease\nduring the lives of the instruments as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity prices fluctuate. Northern Trust’s risk\nis controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same\ncredit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities. Credit support annexes and other similar\nagreements are currently in place with a number of Northern Trust’s counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned\ncredit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net\nunrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with Northern Trust.\nAdditional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling $373.1 million and $21.3\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and $131.8 million and $26.3 million, respectively, as of December 31,\n2022, was not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the\nnet derivative positions with those counterparties.\nCertain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit risk-\nrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash\nsettlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified\nlevels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a\nliability position was $1.2 billion and $190.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash collateral\namounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included $1.1 billion and $55.1 million, respectively,\nposted against these liabilities, resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022 of $52.2 million and $135.8 million, respectively. Accelerated settlement of these\nliabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust.\nNote 28 – Variable Interest Entities\nNorthern Trust is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be variable interest\nentities (VIEs). VIEs are defined within GAAP as entities which either (1) lack sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity\nto finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) have equity investors that lack attributes\ntypical of an equity investor, such as the ability to make significant decisions through voting rights affecting the entity’s\noperations, or the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity, or (3) are\nstructured with voting rights that are disproportionate to the equity investor’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive\nreturns, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of the holder of the equity investment at risk with\ndisproportionately few voting rights. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests are variable interest\nholders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entity’s economic performance and, through its variable interest, the obligation to absorb losses or\nthe right to receive returns that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary\nand is required to consolidate the VIE.\nTax credit structures. Northern Trust holds tax-advantaged investments in unconsolidated entities that own and\noperate affordable housing and other community development projects. These entities, which are limited partnerships and\nsimilar entities, are primarily VIEs and are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits and\nother tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments. Northern Trust invests as a limited\npartner/investor member and lacks both the power to direct the entities’ most significant activities and the obligation to\nabsorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entities. Northern Trust is not required\nto consolidate these entities as it does not have a controlling financial interest and thus is not the primary beneficiary.\nNorthern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these entities is limited to the carrying\namounts of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. Northern Trust’s funding requirements are limited to its\ninvested capital and undrawn commitments for future equity contributions. Northern Trust has no exposure to loss from\nliquidity arrangements and no obligation to purchase assets of these entities.\nNorthern Trust’s investments in these unconsolidated entities and related unfunded commitments are reported in Other\nAssets and Other Liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 163\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE 125: SUMMARY OF UNCONSOLIDATED TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES\n(In Millions) DECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nInvestment Carrying Amount\nAffordable Housing $ 622.8 $ 635.9\nOther Community Development 266.3 268.4\nTotal Investment Carrying Amount(1) $ 889.1 $ 904.3\nUnfunded Commitments\nAffordable Housing $ 178.8 $ 218.9\nOther Community Development — —\nTotal Unfunded Commitments(2) $ 178.8 $ 218.9\n(1) As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $857.0 million and $867.2 million are VIEs, respectively.\n(2) As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $172.0 million and $210.1 million relate to undrawn commitments on VIEs, respectively.\nTax credits and other tax benefits attributable to unconsolidated tax credit structures totaled $113.9 million and $99.1\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and are reported in Provision for Income Taxes on the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nInvestment funds. Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are\ninvestors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed\nand varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the\nprimary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.\nSome of the funds for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements\nthat are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and\ntherefore the funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in ASC 810-10. Northern Trust voluntarily waived\n$8.8 million and $64.2 million of money market fund fees for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31,\n2022, respectively, related to certain competitive factors. Northern Trust does not have any contractual obligations to\nprovide financial support to the funds. Any potential future support of the funds will be at the discretion of Northern Trust\nafter an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances.\nPeriodically, Northern Trust makes seed capital investments to certain funds. As of December 31, 2023, Northern\nTrust had no seed capital investments and no unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Northern Trust had $19.9 million of such investments valued using net asset value per share and\nincluded in Other Assets and had no unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments.\nNote 29 – Pledged Assets, Accepted Collateral and Restricted Assets\nPledged Assets. For our liquidity management strategy, we may pledge loans and/or securities to various financial market\nutilities to allow for client payment, clearing and settlement processing as part of our custody services. We may pledge\nloans or securities to Central Banks, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Chicago and third parties for various purposes,\nfor example: securing public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowings and derivative contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, $1.1 billion and $453.9 million of collateral we pledge,\nrelated to loans and/or securities, is eligible to be repledged or sold by the secured party.

This primarily includes\ncollateral accepted as related to the sponsored member program. Refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” and Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and\nLiabilities” for further information.\nRestricted Assets. Certain cash may be restricted in terms of usage or withdrawal. As a result of the continuing military\nconflict involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and related sanctions and legal restrictions in place, cash balances\ndenominated in Russian rubles received for the benefit of certain clients in our Asset Servicing business are subject to\ndistribution restrictions. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, these balances totaled $722.2 million and $330.4 million,\nrespectively, and are reported in Cash and Due from Banks on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, Northern Trust held cash of $575.2 million and $574.2 million, respectively, to meet\nnon-U.S. reserve requirements. As a result of the economic environment arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal\nReserve reduced the U.S. reserve requirement to zero percent on March 26, 2020. There were no average deposits required\nto meet Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 30 – Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without\nregulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered\nbank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year\nwould exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its\nretained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount\ngreater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.\nUnder Illinois law, an Illinois state bank, prior to paying a dividend, must carry over to surplus at least one-tenth of its\nnet profits since the date of the declaration of the last preceding dividend, until the bank’s surplus is equal to its capital. In\naddition, an Illinois state bank may not pay any dividend in an amount greater than its net profits then on hand, after\ndeduction of losses and bad debts (defined as debts due to a state bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period\nof six months or more, unless the same are well secured and in the process of collection).\nThe Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the\npayment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies\nare authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The\npayment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or\nunsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to\npay dividends (e.g., the Corporation may pay dividends only in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy\nstandards of the Federal Reserve). Our Bank subsidiary could have declared additional dividends of approximately\n$1.5 billion at December 31, 2023, without obtaining prior regulatory approval.\nUnder federal law, financial transactions by the Bank, the Corporation’s insured banking subsidiary, with the\nCorporation and its affiliates that are in the form of loans or extensions of credit, investments, guarantees, derivative\ntransactions, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions or purchases of assets, are restricted. These transactions\nmust be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to non-affiliated companies (i.e. on terms not\nless favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral\nand are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the Bank’s\ncapital and surplus with all affiliates. Other state and federal laws may limit the transfer of funds by the Corporation’s\nbanking subsidiaries to the Corporation and certain of its affiliates.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 165\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 31 – Reporting Segments and Related Information\nSegment Information. Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and\nWealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management\nclients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other\nsupport functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management.\nReporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by\naccounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets,\nliabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology.\nUnder the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on a fully\ntaxable equivalent (FTE) basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest\nincome. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nEquity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory\nconsiderations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of\nlevels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management\nreporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Transfers of\nincome and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between\nreporting segments. Northern Trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other\nfinancial institutions.\nRevenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception\nof non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions,\ndivestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are\nreported within the Other segment.\nReporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also\nsubject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective\nbasis.\nAsset Servicing. Asset Servicing is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and\npublic retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other\ninstitutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of\ncapabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment\nmanagement; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange;\ntreasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client\nrelationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support\nfrom locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWealth Management. Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners,\nexecutives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these\ntargeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services;\nfinancial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education;\nbrokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which\nprovides customized services, including but not limited to: investment consulting; global custody; fiduciary; and private\nbanking; family office consulting, and technology solutions, to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-\nhigh-net-worth individuals and family offices across the globe. Wealth Management services are delivered by\nmultidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London,\nGuernsey, and Abu Dhabi.\nOther. Income and expenses associated with non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions,\ndivestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments are included within Other.\nThe following tables reflect the earnings contribution and average assets of Northern Trust’s reporting segments for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Segment results are stated on an FTE basis which has no impact on\nnet income. Financial measures stated on an FTE basis includes FTE adjustments of $57.5 million, $45.6 million, and\n$35.6 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n166 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE 128: ASSET SERVICING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees $ 2,461.9 $ 2,496.3 $ 2,487.3\nForeign Exchange Trading Income 213.0 281.0 279.0\nOther Noninterest Income 263.4 250.7 261.2\nTotal Noninterest Income 2,938.3 3,028.0 3,027.5\nNet Interest Income(1) 1,197.3 1,072.7 637.2\nRevenue(1) 4,135.6 4,100.7 3,664.7\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses 0.5 2.4 (33.8)\nNoninterest Expense 3,273.2 3,092.7 2,863.0\nIncome before Income Taxes(1) 861.9 1,005.6 835.5\nProvision for Income Taxes(1) 187.1 243.2 194.1\nNet Income $ 674.8 $ 762.4 $ 641.4\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income 61 % 57 % 41 %\nAverage Assets $ 101,472.6 $ 115,646.4 $ 120,883.2\n(1) Financial measures stated on an FTE basis.\nTABLE 129: WEALTH MANAGEMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees $ 1,899.9 $ 1,936.3 $ 1,873.8\nForeign Exchange Trading Income (Loss) (9.1) 7.6 13.6\nOther Noninterest Income 150.8 137.7 188.2\nTotal Noninterest Income 2,041.6 2,081.6 2,075.6\nNet Interest Income(1) 842.2 860.1 781.1\nRevenue(1) 2,883.8 2,941.7 2,856.7\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses 24.0 9.6 (47.7)\nNoninterest Expense 1,882.3 1,815.5 1,651.1\nIncome before Income Taxes(1) 977.5 1,116.6 1,253.3\nProvision for Income Taxes(1) 245.9 310.0 317.0\nNet Income $ 731.6 $ 806.6 $ 936.3\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income 66 % 60 % 61 %\nAverage Assets $ 41,176.6 $ 36,905.5 $ 35,480.0\n(1) Financial measures stated on an FTE basis.\nTABLE 130: OTHER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNoninterest Income (Loss) $ (188.4) $ (235.6) $ (21.3)\nNet Interest Income(1) — — —\nRevenue(1) (188.4) (235.6) (21.3)\nNoninterest Expense 128.7 74.7 21.8\nIncome (Loss) before Income Taxes(1) (317.1) (310.3) (43.1)\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes(1) (18.0) (77.3) (10.7)\nNet Income (Loss) $ (299.1) $ (233.0) $ (32.4)\nPercentage of Consolidated Net Income (Loss) (27) % (17) % (2) %\nAverage Assets $ — $ — $ —\n(1) Financial measures stated on an FTE basis.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 167\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE 131: CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNoninterest Income\nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees $ 4,361.8 $ 4,432.6 $ 4,361.1\nForeign Exchange Trading Income 203.9 288.6 292.6\nOther Noninterest Income 225.8 152.8 428.1\nTotal Noninterest Income 4,791.5 4,874.0 5,081.8\nNet Interest Income 1,982.0 1,887.2 1,382.7\nRevenue 6,773.5 6,761.2 6,464.5\nProvision for (Release of) Credit Losses 24.5 12.0 (81.5)\nNoninterest Expense 5,284.2 4,982.9 4,535.9\nIncome before Income Taxes 1,464.8 1,766.3 2,010.1\nProvision for Income Taxes 357.5 430.3 464.8\nNet Income $ 1,107.3 $ 1,336.0 $ 1,545.3\nAverage Assets $ 142,649.2 $ 152,551.9 $ 156,363.2\nGeographic Area Information. Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset\nmanagement, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust\nare managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets.\nNon-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system.\nHowever, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the\ncomplex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses\nand assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have\nbeen made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest\nexpense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding. Allocations of indirect\nnoninterest expenses, when made, are based on various methods such as time, space, and number of employees.\nThe following table summarizes Northern Trust’s performance based on the allocation process described above\nwithout regard to guarantors or the location of collateral.\nTABLE 132: DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL ASSETS AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE\n% OF TOTAL % OF INCOME BEFORE % OF % OF\n($ In Millions) TOTAL ASSETS TOTAL REVENUE(1) TOTAL INCOME TAXES TOTAL NET INCOME TOTAL\n2023\nNon-U.S. $ 39,661.5 26 % $ 2,156.1 32 % $ 473.7 32 % $ 354.0 32 %\nU.S. 111,121.6 74 % 4,617.4 68 % 991.1 68 % 753.3 68 %\nTotal $ 150,783.1 100 % $ 6,773.5 100 % $ 1,464.8 100 % $ 1,107.3 100 %\n2022\nNon-U.S. $ 35,991.3 23 % $ 2,273.3 34 % $ 560.9 32 % $ 420.2 31 %\nU.S. 119,045.4 77 % 4,487.9 66 % 1,205.4 68 % 915.8 69 %\nTotal $ 155,036.7 100 % $ 6,761.2 100 % $ 1,766.3 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 %\n2021\nNon-U.S. $ 38,555.3 21 % $ 2,017.5 31 % $ 569.4 28 % $ 426.7 28 %\nU.S. 145,334.5 79 % 4,447.0 69 % 1,440.7 72 % 1,118.6 72 %\nTotal $ 183,889.8 100 % $ 6,464.5 100 % $ 2,010.1 100 % $ 1,545.3 100 %\n(1) Total revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income.\nNote 32 – Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal bank\nregulatory authorities. Under these requirements, banks must maintain specific risk-based capital and leverage ratios in\norder to be classified as “well-capitalized.” The regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that\nmeet minimum capital requirements but are not “well-capitalized” and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to\ntake “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios. Such prompt corrective\naction could have a direct material effect on a bank’s financial statements.\n168 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had capital ratios above the levels required for classification as a “well-\ncapitalized” institution and had not received any regulatory notification of a lower classification. The results of the 2023\nDFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 28, 2023, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and\neffective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for\nthe annual capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2023 and continues through September 30, 2024.\nAdditionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements\nin the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking\nsubsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements. There were no conditions or events since\nDecember 31, 2023, that management believes have adversely affected the capital categorization of any Northern Trust\nsubsidiary bank. The following table provides capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank determined by Basel III\nphased in requirements.\nTABLE 133: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 DECEMBER 31, 2022\nSTANDARDIZED ADVANCED STANDARDIZED ADVANCED\n($ In Millions) APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH APPROACH\nBALANCE RATIO BALANCE RATIO BALANCE RATIO BALANCE RATIO\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation $ 10,179.4 11.4 % $ 10,179.4 13.4 % $ 9,539.7 10.8 % $ 9,539.7 11.5 %\nThe Northern Trust Company 10,806.2 12.2 10,806.2 14.6 10,111.2 11.6 10,111.2 12.4\nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nThe Northern Trust Company 5,768.4 6.5 4,808.6 6.5 5,684.4 6.5 5,286.2 6.5\nTier 1 Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation 11,023.9 12.3 11,023.9 14.5 10,397.4 11.8 10,397.4 12.5\nThe Northern Trust Company 10,806.2 12.2 10,806.2 14.6 10,111.2 11.6 10,111.2 12.4\nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation 5,371.6 6.0 4,558.8 6.0 5,286.5 6.0 4,990.9 6.0\nThe Northern Trust Company 7,099.5 8.0 5,918.3 8.0 6,996.2 8.0 6,506.1 8.0\nTotal Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation 12,733.9 14.2 12,514.7 16.5 12,245.5 13.9 12,045.9 14.5\nThe Northern Trust Company 12,279.3 13.8 12,060.2 16.3 11,766.8 13.5 11,567.2 14.2\nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation 8,952.7 10.0 7,598.0 10.0 8,810.8 10.0 8,318.1 10.0\nThe Northern Trust Company 8,874.4 10.0 7,397.9 10.0 8,745.3 10.0 8,132.6 10.0\nTier 1 Leverage\nNorthern Trust Corporation 11,023.9 8.1 11,023.9 8.1 10,397.4 7.1 10,397.4 7.1\nThe Northern Trust Company 10,806.2 8.0 10,806.2 8.0 10,111.2 6.9 10,111.2 6.9\nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nThe Northern Trust Company 6,764.0 5.0 6,764.0 5.0 7,323.8 5.0 7,323.8 5.0\nSupplementary Leverage(1)\nNorthern Trust Corporation N/A N/A 11,023.9 8.6 N/A N/A 10,397.4 7.9\nThe Northern Trust Company N/A N/A 10,806.2 8.5 N/A N/A 10,111.2 7.7\nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A\nThe Northern Trust Company N/A N/A 3,825.6 3.0 N/A N/A 3,931.5 3.0\n(1) In November 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that established a deduction for central bank deposits from the\ntotal leverage exposures of custodial banking organizations, including the Corporation and the Bank, equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking\norganization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking\norganization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. The rule became effective on April 1, 2020.\nThe supplementary leverage ratios at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 for the Corporation and the Bank reflect the impact of the final rule.\nUnder the final Basel III rules, the Corporation and the Bank are required to calculate and publicly disclose risk-based\ncapital ratios using two methodologies: an advanced approach and a standardized approach. Under the advanced approach,\ncredit RWA are based on internal credit models and parameters. Additionally, the advanced approach incorporates\noperational risk RWA. Under the standardized approach, RWA are based on supervisory prescribed risk weights that are\nprimarily dependent on counterparty type and asset class.\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 169\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the capital adequacy of the Corporation and the Bank is assessed based on the lower of the advanced approach or\nstandardized approach capital ratios.\nNote 33 – Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only)\nCondensed financial information is presented in the following tables.

Based on such evaluation, such\nofficers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance to the\nCorporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements.\nThis internal control includes monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.\nManagement assessed the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\nthe criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting. Additionally, KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Corporation’s\nconsolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023, included in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the\nevaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\n172 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the\nyears in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial\nstatements), and our report dated February 27, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial\nstatements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\nall material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 27, 2024\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION 173\nITEM 9B – OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) adopted, terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\nITEM 9C – DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nITEM 10 – DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated by reference to “Supplemental Item – Information About Our\nExecutive Officers” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the following sections of the Corporation’s\ndefinitive Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: “Item 1 – Election of Directors,” “Information\nabout the Nominees for Director,” “Security Ownership by Directors and Executive Officers,” “Corporate Governance –\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics,” “Corporate Governance – Director Nominations and Qualifications and Proxy\nAccess,” “Board and Board Committee Information – Audit Committee” and “Board and Board Committee Information –\nBoard Committees.”\nITEM 11 – EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,”\n“Human Capital and Compensation Committee Report,” “Executive Compensation,” and “Director Compensation”\nsections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nITEM 12 – SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND\nRELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Security Ownership by Directors and\nExecutive Officers,” “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners,” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information”\nsections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nITEM 13 – CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR\nINDEPENDENCE\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Board and Board Committee\nInformation,” “Corporate Governance – Director Independence” and the “Corporate Governance – Related Person\nTransactions Policy” sections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of\nStockholders.\nITEM 14 – PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Audit Matters” section of the\nCorporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n174 2023 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION\nPART IV\nITEM 15 – EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nITEM 15(a)(1) AND (2) – NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES LIST OF FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nThe following financial statements of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated herein by reference.\nFor Northern Trust Corporation and Subsidiaries:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets -

The increase in collective reserves was\nprimarily in the C&I portfolio, driven by modest deterioration in credit quality, and the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio,\ndriven by expectations for weaker CRE prices.\nQ3 2023\nThe provision in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by a\nsmall number of large new loans and renewals and credit quality deterioration of certain CRE and C&I loans, partially offset by a\nnet improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook.\n4\nNORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\n% Change Q3 2024 vs.\n($ In Millions) Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2023 Q2 2024 Q3 2023\nNoninterest Expense\nCompensation $ 583.6 $ 665.2 $ 558.1 (12) % 5 %\nEmployee Benefits 109.2 100.2 100.8 9 8\nOutside Services 256.3 260.9 229.6 (2) 12\nEquipment and Software 270.4 277.5 232.5 (3) 16\nOccupancy 53.8 54.8 58.7 (2) (8)\nOther Operating Expense 86.1 175.3 98.5 (51) (13)\nTotal Noninterest Expense $ 1,359.4 $ 1,533.9 $ 1,278.2 (11) % 6 %\nEnd of Period Full-Time Equivalent Employees 23,300 23,000 23,300 1 % — %\nCompensation expense decreased sequentially primarily due to the prior quarter severance-related charge.

Net interest spread is calculated as the difference between the interest rate earned (annualized interest income\ndivided by average interest-earning assets) and the interest rate incurred (annualized interest expense divided by average interest-related funds).\n2023 2024\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Earnings Assets 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr\n0.98 % 0.10 % 0.03 % 1.30 % 4.69 % Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits 4.17 % 4.65 % 4.99 % 5.11 % 5.15 % 5.12 % 4.98 %\n1.21 0.41 0.16 1.11 3.00 Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks(2) 2.72 2.82 3.22 3.25 3.15 2.53 2.35\n2.73 1.37 0.41 3.22 4.92 Federal Funds Sold 4.79 5.25 5.62 5.63 5.64 5.64 5.64\n2.10 0.31 0.33 9.68 166.71 Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell(5) 48.80 92.09 193.58 492.23 639.92 474.48 362.66\nDebt Securities:\n2.51 1.77 1.28 1.91 4.35 Available for Sale 3.80 4.17 4.51 4.94 5.41 5.52 5.50\n0.94 0.59 0.80 1.26 1.87 Held to Maturity 1.64 1.80 1.93 2.13 2.02 1.95 1.88\n3.29 3.27 1.59 3.84 13.50 Trading Account 7.63 42.53 21.15 5.19 — — —\n2.14 1.46 1.11 1.64 3.08 Total Debt Securities 2.72 2.97 3.18 3.46 3.70 3.85 3.86\n3.74 2.32 1.92 3.28 6.06 Loans and Leases 5.60 6.06 6.26 6.32 6.34 6.38 6.45\n3.56 3.63 3.43 4.03 4.87 Other Interest-Earning Assets(3) 4.67 5.04 4.65 5.05 4.51 4.68 4.71\n2.36 % 1.35 % 1.00 % 2.11 % 5.64 % Total Earning Assets 4.38 % 5.23 % 6.03 % 7.04 % 7.37 % 7.47 % 7.49 %\nInterest-Bearing Funds\n0.97 % 0.20 % 0.05 % 0.74 % 2.85 % Savings, Money Market and Other 2.35 % 2.67 % 3.05 % 3.40 % 3.72 % 3.75 % 3.76 %\n1.86 1.30 0.55 1.68 4.54 Savings Certificates and Other Time 3.70 4.23 4.69 5.10 5.19 5.23 5.19\n0.57 (0.03) (0.11) 0.56 3.07 Non-U.S. Offices - Interest-Bearing 2.50 2.90 3.38 3.56 3.59 3.58 3.39\n0.68 0.06 (0.06) 0.63 3.07 Total Interest-Bearing Deposits 2.49 2.89 3.35 3.59 3.71 3.73 3.61\n2.05 0.22 (0.19) 2.43 4.99 Federal Funds Purchased 4.45 4.97 5.18 5.25 5.11 5.16 5.07\n1.89 0.47 0.07 20.94 383.84 Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase(5) 135.62 234.39 422.85 759.25 667.86 596.00 686.17\n2.34 0.71 0.28 2.31 5.25 Other Borrowings(4) 4.83 5.17 5.59 5.49 5.20 5.43 5.32\n3.04 2.24 1.69 3.36 6.22 Senior Notes 5.79 6.14 6.44 6.50 6.45 6.50 6.30\n3.36 2.24 1.81 3.49 5.69 Long-Term Debt 5.73 5.89 5.94 5.45 5.50 5.50 5.47\n2.98 1.52 0.78 — — Floating Rate Capital Debt — — — — — — —\n0.96 % 0.21 % 0.02 % 0.92 % 4.91 % Total Interest-Bearing Liabilities 3.34 % 4.36 % 5.48 % 6.60 % 6.86 % 6.98 % 6.93 %\n1.40 % 1.14 % 0.98 % 1.19 % 0.73 % Net Interest Spread 1.04 % 0.87 % 0.55 % 0.44 % 0.51 % 0.49 % 0.56 %\n1.60 % 1.19 % 0.99 % 1.39 % 1.56 % Net Interest Margin 1.62 % 1.57 % 1.45 % 1.59 % 1.61 % 1.57 % 1.68 %\n(1) Fully taxable equivalent.

Corporation\nRECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT\n($ in Millions)\nNorthern Trust presents certain financial measures on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, which is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP). Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer\nindication of these financial measures for comparative purposes.\nNet interest income (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP and other FTE measures include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income, consistent with industry practice.

Management believes an FTE presentation\nprovides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes.\nNet interest income (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP and other FTE measures include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income, consistent with industry\npractice. The adjustments are based on the federal income tax rate, where the rate is adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of related federal tax benefit. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields\non taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

In the fixed income market, income potential combined with generally higher credit quality make high yield bonds attractive for investors.\n\nSummarizing the outlook, NTAM Chief Investment Officer of Global Asset Allocation Anwiti Bahuguna, Ph.D., said: “In multi-asset portfolios, we maintain a preference for equities over fixed income. We expect U.S. equities to benefit from an economic soft landing and healthier corporate profits than most other regions. In 2025, we expect more modest gains for 60/40 portfolios with U.S. equities leading the charge again.”\n\nNTAM Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income Christian Roth added, “Within fixed income, we continue to favor high yield bonds because of elevated yields, strong fundamentals and a supportive market backdrop. Credit ratings upgrades are outpacing downgrades, and the overall credit quality of the high yield market remains historically high.\n\nNTAM’s 2025 Global Investment Outlook across all asset classes globally may be found [here](https://www.northerntrust.com/united-states/insights-research/2024/investment-management/global-investment-outlook).\n\nAsset class highlights include:\n\n  * **U.S. Equities:** We expect softer but continued U.S. economic growth to still translate into healthy earnings and revenue growth. We are also constructive on small cap equities, which will likely benefit from lower interest rates as about half of small cap debt is floating interest rate.\n  * **High Yield Bonds:** Above-average yields, combined with historically high credit ratings in the high yield market, support a strong outlook.\n  * **Money Markets:** Money market funds remain an attractive alternative to other cash management options like deposits or Treasury bills, even as the Federal Reserve has started to cut rates. We see little chance of money market rates returning to near-zero. The Bank of England, with concerns over inflation, will likely cut rates at slower pace than European Central Bank while we expect Japan to increase its policy rate slowly.\n  * **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):** While U.S. inflation likely will settle into a range above the Federal Reserve's target of 2% for 2025, we expect the path to be bumpy. We believe TIPS are an important defensive portfolio component for unanticipated inflation.\n  * **Private Credit:** We believe private credit has room to grow, supported by the shift of lending from traditional capital providers to private credit asset managers, while lower interest rates encourage potentially moremergers and acquisitions in 2025. \n\n\n\n**_Global Economic Outlook_**\n\nIn the U.S., NTAM’s base case economic outlook for 2025 is a soft landing. NTAM expects economic growth to settle slightly below 2024 levels, inflation to ease further toward 2% and the Federal Reserve to proceed gradually cutting rates. However, NTAM sees two risk cases from the economic effects of policy initiatives of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump: reflation and supply restraint. In both cases, the net effect of restrictive immigration, higher tariffs, income tax cuts and deregulation could create economic conditions that disrupt the current soft landing path.\n\nIn Europe, the economic picture straddles growth and contraction. A resilient labor force and target-level inflation is coupled with manufacturing sector contraction and risks of further geopolitical tensions and trade barriers. In the U.K., NTAM expects the Bank of England to maintain a gradual and cautious approach to further interest rate cuts.\n\nIn Asia, while the overall optics are for favorable growth, the outlook for China remains a central concern, with economic growth falling short of the government’s 5% target. A slowing economy is deepening a deflationary loop, with consumer price inflation slightly above zero and producer prices deep into deflation. Japan’s economic growth in 2024 was unspectacular, but wage gains that may support consumer spending are spreading across the economy and those gains may continue into 2025.\n\n**About Northern Trust Asset Management**\n\n[Northern Trust Asset Management](https://www.northerntrust.com/what-we-do/investment-management) is a global investment manager that helps investors navigate changing market environments in efforts to realize their long-term objectives.
