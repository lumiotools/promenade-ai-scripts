Direct Cost of Sales were $167.4M (FY23 $145.4M), resulting in an expected gross profit\nincrease of 17.4% to $17.7M (FY23 $15.1M).\n• Earnings Before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) for the underlying business is expected to be up 41.5% to\n$5.2M (FY23 $3.7M) after Total Operating Expenses of the underlying business increased just 12.4% to\n$11.9M (FY23 $10.6M); and Depreciation & Amortisation fell to $624K (FY23 $832K).\n• Underlying net profit before tax (“NPBT”) is expected to be up 51.4% to $4.4M (FY23 $2.9M), after Net\nInterest Expense of $774K (FY23 $751K).\n• Cash and Cash Equivalents increased 50.8% to $8.0M at year end (30 June 2023 $5.3M) net of a $2.0M\ncash payment in December 2023 related to the acquisition of Millennium3 (“M3”).\n• The strong result represents the fourth consecutive year of compounding growth for the underlying\nbusiness and provides for a return to dividends. The Board anticipates being able to declare a fully\nfranked dividend of 0.4 cents on release of the Company’s Audited Financial Statements and has\nreinstated its policy to pay dividends biannually (subject to available cash).\nWT Financial Group Limited (“WTL” or “the Company”) is pleased to provide indicative results for the full year\nto 30 June 2024 (“FY24” or “Period”), with the Company’s underlying business operations recording a 15.3%\nincrease in revenue to $185.1M (FY23 $160.5M) and a 51.4% increase in underlying net profit before tax\n(“NPBT”) to $4.4M (FY23 $2.5M). Solid operating cashflow resulted in a more than 50% increase in year-end\ncash to $8.0M, providing for a return to a policy of paying dividends biannually.\nWT FINANCIAL GROUP LIMITED Level 5, 95 Pitt Street,\nSydney NSW 2000\nABN 87 169 037 058 ASX: WTL\n02 9248 0422\nwtfglimited.com\nA summary of the indicative results is provided herein, including details of the expected positive impact on the\nunderlying business results in the Company’s statutory accounts from one-off income and expenses.\nOne-off income and expenses to (positively) impact Statutory Results\nAdding to the result of the underlying business, net one-off income and expenses relating to the sale of assets\n(B2C mortgage book) and purchase of assets (M3) during the Period are expected to positively impact profit by\n$357K.

However, with the benefit of carried-forward\ntax losses no cash tax liability will arise. Notwithstanding carried-forward tax losses, the Company has a\nfranking credit balance more than $1.4M, which will enable a dividend to be fully franked.\nNet assets as at 30 June 2024 increased 14.9% to $29.4M (30 June 2023 $25.6M), and the Company had a total\nof 339.2M shares and 1.5M options on issue as at 30 June 2024.
