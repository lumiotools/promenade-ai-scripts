Q1 2024 was a transformative quarter for our company as we built upon the progress and achievements that we reached in 2023, which resulted in several significant milestones for our company.\n\n_Cloud service_\n\nOn February 20 2024, we launched the Beamr Cloud SaaS solution, which enables everyone to perform high-quality, high-scale video processing at attractive pricing. Our new video cloud service offers more capabilities than we initially expected. They include video standards modernization from AVC to HEVC, and adoption acceleration of new standards.\n\n_Capital raising_\n\nAlso in February 2024, we raised gross proceeds of $13.8 million in an underwritten offering, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. We intend to use the raised capital to substantially expand the reach of our video cloud services by investing in research and development efforts, sales and marketing activities, cloud operating costs, as well as general and administrative corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We plan to expand Beamr Cloud across the emerging markets in the video world: User-Generated Content, Generative AI, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Streaming (OTT).\n\n_AI workflows_\n\nThroughout Q1 2024, we have teamed up with other industry leaders, such as NVIDIA, to highlight the benefits and features of using our technology and other artificial intelligence (AI) workflows.\n\nIn March 2024, we presented accelerated video AI workflows and our plans to integrate AI workflows into Beamr Cloud. We also released the results of a case study that highlights how our technology enables accelerated machine learning training by using significantly smaller video files and without any negative impact on the video AI process.\n\nDuring Q2 2024, we plan to focus on enabling vision AI processes in Beamr Cloud. Enabling AI workflows, such as object detection, is in tandem with video optimization, as GPU is a natural acceleration platform to both. These new capabilities will allow Beamr to enhance our offerings to video customers and offer services to the new emerging markets of AI. Furthermore, we plan to continue introducing improvements to Beamr Cloud making it easier to use and allow customers higher configurability and flexibly using the service.\n\n_Financial highlights*_\n\nIn Q1 2024, we generated approximately $0.39M in revenues compared with $0.33M in Q1 2023, representing a 18% increase, and as of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $19M of cash and cash equivalents including accrued interest. The revenues are driven from existing customers, and we expect contribution of the Beamr Cloud revenues to start realizing later this year.Respectfully,\n\nSharon Carmel\n\nChief Executive Officer, Beamr Imaging Ltd.\n\n* This unaudited preliminary financial information regarding our revenues for the three months and quarter ended March 31, 2024, is based upon our estimates and subject to completion of our quarter-end financial results. Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by, and is the responsibility of, management.

Our new video cloud service, launched in February 2024, offers more capabilities than we initially expected. They include video standards modernization from AVC to HEVC, and adoption acceleration of new standards.\n\nJust before announcing Beamr Cloud launch, we raised gross proceeds of $13.8 million in an underwritten offering in February 2024, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. We intend to use the raised capital to substantially expand the reach of our video cloud services by investing in research and development efforts, sales and marketing activities, cloud operating costs, as well as general and administrative corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We plan to expand Beamr Cloud across the emerging markets in the video world: User-Generated Content, Generative AI, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Streaming (OTT).\n\nDuring Q2 2024, Beamr plans to emphasize enabling vision AI processes in Beamr Cloud. Recently we published a technical paper that showed how Beamr tech downsized video files by 40% on average — streamlining Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning processes and allowing significant savings in storage and costs. On March 17th, we plan to participate in GTC [https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=A_I8z_Ab-etSc7T79brr8klb-gvgQeZrJKXPSv6RRaJw7HDm5Vtq7NjzD2AxlP5-5k5yuK1JOyfYyHM8VChdfhsRNNzMmvpYD6d46Rkw8iY=), an NVIDIA led conference for the era of AI. At the conference, we will provide more information on our plans for integrating AI workflows into Beamr Cloud.\n\n_2023 Highlights_\n\nIn 2023, we took our vision public on NASDAQ, focusing on optimizing video at scale. \n\nWe signed up another one of the top five largest media companies in the world to provide our video compression and optimization technology and solutions to its products and that following such agreement, Beamr is now working with three of the top five largest media companies in the world. We believe that this is a testimony of our leadership in video compression and optimization solutions.\n\n_2023 Financial Results_\n\nRegarding our financial results for 2023:\n\n  * Revenues increased by $0.05 million or 2% to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.86 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to binding transactions with new customers versus other transactions that were terminated. \n  * Cost of revenues were $0.096 million the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.098 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, with no material change during those periods. \n  * Research and development expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 12% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries due to changes in personal and capitalization of costs consisting mainly of direct labor (including stock-based compensation expenses) associated with creating the internally developed software related to our cloud-based SaaS solution offset by an increase in professional fees. \n  * Selling and marketing expenses decreased by $0.54 million, or 60% to $0.36 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $0.9 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and professional fees. \n  * General and administrative expenses increased by $0.7 million, or 82% to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $0.83 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to professional fees related to legal, accounting, investor relations as well as insurance coverage resulting from the completion of our initial public offering in March 2023. \n  * Financing expenses, net decreased by $0.4 million, or 230% to $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $0.17 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to income from the change in fair value of convertible advanced investment, decrease in amortization of discount and accrued interest and interest on bank deposits, offset by the change in fair value of derivative warrant liability and change in exchange rate differences. \n  * Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.7 million or $0.06 basic net loss per ordinary share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $0.48 basic net loss per ordinary share, in the year ended December 31, 2022. \n  * Beamr ended 2023 with $6.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $0.7 million as of December 31, 2022. This does not include $13.8 in gross proceeds received from our recently completed underwritten offering in February 2024. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, Q4 2023 specifically presented strong revenues, consistent with our legacy business's robust performance in the fourth quarter of the year with $1.5 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.6 million in revenue in the same period in 2022.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSharon Carmel Chief Executive Officer, Beamr Imaging Ltd.\n\nA copy of Beamr’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at [https://www.sec.gov/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=A_I8z_Ab-etSc7T79brr8vdFzREiBHCefJnJUaMouAPsHsA8vZMuHPK-IwGltv6cB4Kx3QelBvtYX12m51tmVA==) and posted on Beamr’s investor relations website at [https://www.investors.beamr.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=A_I8z_Ab-etSc7T79brr8oRZFGuJeMhrgCRWF-9Y2Ys23jGyWBHITtQHnXu_V3jXnRf4B4QX-ggKVWPneR_TUkf8UbXNbQeUzoRZsYgHa8bLjByFfhGvqICLmpJLLALK).

(NASDAQ: BMR), a leader in video optimization technology and solutions, today issued a Letter to Shareholders from Sharon Carmel, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nDear Shareholders:\n\nI am pleased to share with you our Q3-2024 activities, progress, and other recent updates. \n\n**_Below are the key aspects of our strategy:_**\n\nIn 2024, Beamr has strengthened its market presence by participating in 7 leading trade shows and conferences during the year so far, including Mile High Video, GTC, NAB, SIGGRAPH, Oracle CloudWorld, IBC and Demuxed. \n\nDuring these events, Beamr executives delivered high-impact presentations to hundreds of industry professionals, showcasing our innovative technology and expanding SaaS solutions. Furthermore, we held over 100 face-to-face meetings with existing and prospective customers. These efforts focused on differentiating Beamr in the video market and highlighting the value of our high-quality, high-efficiency, GPU-accelerated SaaS offerings to key and prospective customers in emerging markets, such as Media & Entertainment, User-Generated content and Internet-of-Things. \n\n**_Building the sales funnel_**\n\nWe achieved a significant milestone with our first cloud sale, demonstrating that all of Beamr SaaS’ components - ranging from onboarding and connecting the customers' video repositories to billing - are functioning as designed.\n\nCurrently, we are working on dozens of new leads and deals in our sales funnel, which we are aiming to convert into signed customers in the end of 2024 and leading into 2025. Though we still cannot give projections, we are encouraged by the substantial interest generated since the launch of Beamr Cloud in February 2024, and we are pleased with the progress we’ve made so far.\n\n**_Optimizing Live 4Kp60 using GPUs_**\n\nBeamr successfully demonstrated live video optimization for the first time at 4K resolution (Ultra-High Definition) and 60 frames per second (4Kp60) - the only live optimization available on GPUs (for more details, read [_here_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AGGvdTHnJM9SYMaxnDvFLgdlJ4rHLaHKZ_4SS2Sz7Ncmz0QLVrK__01e0Uqso2AfhHuvc4jbHvhw7rq0g0aq-4ZIuz0jjAAp8jjL58hr-XOLR90PS7X3JpqdPiYg8hQ30V2Z7xaI-KPyr2YbhVv7fMnxiVJOl_1gyUBwSSq2ZgrVHym-YjjXVsmNBMq5MaBJCHzie5cQJRyXDXXiiAMLOfBAXZLa96TmT-1kKhPCBAe0sJMjimvx-JLw5W3PYAxJ)). \n\nThe demonstration set a higher bar than video on demand, as live video optimization requires fast and constant video processing. We view live video optimization as a highly valuable milestone that can contribute significantly to our sales growth in 2025. \n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/854bc00a-8720-4b47-914c-9fab7e98fad9/ibc-booth-03-png.png)[](# \"Expand\")\n\n_Beamr booth at IBC 2024_\n\n**_Q3-2024 Highlights_**\n\nDuring Q3-2024, we strengthened Beamr Cloud with our first AI capabilities, expanded our collaborations with video industry leaders, and created a new channel to reach customers with large-scale video libraries in the media and entertainment market. \n\nIn July 2024, we launched our first AI capabilities integrated into Beamr Cloud, enabling automatic caption and transcription generation in multiple languages. It is a first step in augmenting Beamr Cloud with AI capabilities.\n\nIn August 2024, we announced that Beamr Cloud supports automated and scalable modernization of video to the advanced AV1 format (AOMedia Video 1), which is poised to address a significant challenge that has occupied many video industry professionals in recent years. \n\nAs a GPU-accelerated video service, Beamr Cloud enables its customers to enhance videos with AI capabilities, while simultaneously performing video operations, such as upgrades to advanced formats like AV1.\n\n_Delivering “Forever Video”_\n\nIn October 2024, we commenced a collaboration with Bridge Digital Inc., a proven video technology integrator, to offer a specialized service for companies and organizations with large-scale video repositories, including those in news, sports, entertainment and user-generated content. \n\nUtilizing Bridge Digitial’s extensive expertise in media storage and video management, this partnership enables companies that rely on video for their daily operations or manage vast video libraries to achieve “Forever Video” - future-proofing their content to ensure long-term compatibility through efficient, automatic, and scalable processes, all while significantly reducing costs.\n\n_Capturing the interest of video industry leaders_\n\nThroughout Q3-2024, we participated in top industry conferences showcasing our collaborations with tech giants and capturing the interest of video industry leaders.\n\nAt SIGGRAPH 2024 and at Oracle CloudWorld 2024, we demonstrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) an optimized production of large, high-quality, high-resolution videos rendered from 3D design, enabling the sharing of heavy files of 3D model visualizations with creative teams members, customers, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe also participated in investor conferences, where we presented Beamr’s achievements and future plans, such as the H.C. Wainwright 26th Annual Global Investment Conference and the 2024 ThinkEquity Conference.\n\n_\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f66345ec-f434-4f04-a514-1260c1ea7b13/think-equity-2024-png-pr.png)[](# \"Expand\")\n\n_\n\n_CEO Sharon Carmel presenting at ThinkEquity 2024_\n\n**_Financial highlights_**** _*_**\n\nDuring the period of nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately $1.5M in revenues, compared with $1.43M in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 5% increase, and as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $16.6M of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nHistorically Q4 is a relatively strong quarter with 2024 being no exception. So far in Q4-2024, we have deals worth approximately $1.16M in revenues. We can also share that we have been successful in increasing our license fees as we look into 2025.\n\nRespectfully,Sharon Carmel\n\nChief Executive Officer, Beamr Imaging Ltd.\n\n**About Beamr**\n\nBeamr (Nasdaq: BMR) is a world leader in content-adaptive video optimization and modernization.
