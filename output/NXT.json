release \n\n**Schedule V**\n\nNextracker Inc. Notes \n\nTo supplement Nextracker’s unaudited selected financial data presented consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges and gains, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. These supplemental measures exclude certain legal and other charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization, other discrete events as applicable and the related tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with Nextracker’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Nextracker’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. \n\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of the Company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to the Company’s ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, for calculating return on investment, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering: \n\n  * the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results; \n  * the ability to better identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and perform related trend analysis; \n  * a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business; and \n  * an easier way to compare the Company’s operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n\n\nThe following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures: \n\n_Stock-based compensation expense_ consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of unvested restricted share unit and stock option awards granted to employees. The Company believes that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of its operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on its operating results. \n\n_Intangible amortization_ consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and therefore excludes such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding these costs is relevant to its assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of its competitors. \n\n_The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (“45X Credit”)_ which was established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is a per-unit tax credit earned over time for each clean energy component domestically produced and sold by a manufacturer. The 45X Credit was eligible for domestic parts manufactured after January 1, 2023. The Company has executed agreements with certain suppliers to ramp up its U.S. manufacturing footprint. These suppliers produce 45X Credit eligible parts, including torque tubes, and structural fasteners, that will then be incorporated into a solar tracker. The Company has contractually agreed with these suppliers to share a portion of the credit related to Nextracker’s purchases. The Company accounts for these credits as a reduction of the purchase price of the parts acquired from the vendor and therefore a reduction of inventory until the part is sold, at which point the Company recognizes such credit as a reduction of cost of sales on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company determined the amount of the 45X vendor rebates it expects to receive in accordance with the vendor contracts and recognized a cumulative reduction to cost of sales of $121.4 million related to 45X Credit vendor rebates earned on production of eligible components shipped to projects starting on January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding the benefit from the vendor credits provides a more consistent comparison of its performance given the cumulative nature of the amount recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, these 45X credit vendor rebates are not excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n_Acquisition costs_ consist primarily of nonrecurring transaction costs for business acquisitions. \n\n_Adjustment for taxes_ relates to the tax effects of the various adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income and certain adjustments related to non-recurring settlements of tax contingencies or other non-recurring tax charges, when applicable. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030347227r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investors, Financial Media** Mary Lai VP, IR & Financial Communications Investor@nextracker.com\n\n**Media** Kristan Kirsh SVP, Global Marketing Media@nextracker.com\n\nSource: Nextracker\n\n[View All News](https://investors.nextracker.com/news/default.aspx)\n"

release \n\n**Schedule V**\n\nNextracker Inc. Notes \n\nTo supplement Nextracker’s unaudited selected financial data presented consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges and gains, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. These supplemental measures exclude certain legal and other charges, stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization, other discrete events as applicable and the related tax effects. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with Nextracker’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Nextracker’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. \n\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of the Company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to the Company’s ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, for calculating return on investment, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering: \n\n  * the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results; \n  * the ability to better identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and perform related trend analysis; \n  * a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business; and \n  * an easier way to compare the Company’s operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n\n\nThe following are explanations of each of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding each of these individual items in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures: \n\n_Stock-based compensation expense_ consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of unvested restricted share unit and stock option awards granted to employees. The Company believes that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of its operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types. In addition, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on its operating results. \n\n_Intangible amortization_ consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. The Company considers its operating results without these charges when evaluating its ongoing performance and forecasting its earnings trends, and therefore excludes such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding these costs is relevant to its assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of its competitors. \n\n_The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (“45X Credit”)_ which was established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is a per-unit tax credit earned over time for each clean energy component domestically produced and sold by a manufacturer. The 45X Credit was eligible for domestic parts manufactured after January 1, 2023. The Company has executed agreements with certain suppliers to ramp up its U.S. manufacturing footprint. These suppliers produce 45X Credit eligible parts, including torque tubes, and structural fasteners, that will then be incorporated into a solar tracker. The Company has contractually agreed with these suppliers to share a portion of the credit related to Nextracker’s purchases. The Company accounts for these credits as a reduction of the purchase price of the parts acquired from the vendor and therefore a reduction of inventory until the part is sold, at which point the Company recognizes such credit as a reduction of cost of sales on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company determined the amount of the 45X vendor rebates it expects to receive in accordance with the vendor contracts and recognized a cumulative reduction to cost of sales of $121.4 million related to 45X Credit vendor rebates earned on production of eligible components shipped to projects starting on January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024. The Company believes that the assessment of its operations excluding the benefit from the vendor credits provides a more consistent comparison of its performance given the cumulative nature of the amount recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, these 45X credit vendor rebates are not excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n_Acquisition costs_ consist primarily of nonrecurring transaction costs for business acquisitions. \n\n_Adjustment for taxes_ relates to the tax effects of the various adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income and certain adjustments related to non-recurring settlements of tax contingencies or other non-recurring tax charges, when applicable. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030347227r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investors, Financial Media** Mary Lai VP, IR & Financial Communications Investor@nextracker.com\n\n**Media** Kristan Kirsh SVP, Global Marketing Media@nextracker.com\n\nSource: Nextracker\n\n[View All News](https://investors.nextracker.com/news/default.aspx)\n"

Description of business and organization of Nextracker Inc.\nNextracker Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Nextracker,” “we,” the “Company”) is a leading provider of intelligent, integrated solar tracker, foundations, and software\nsolutions used in utility-scale and ground-mounted distributed generation solar projects around the world. Nextracker’s products enable solar PV power plants\nto follow the sun’s movement across the sky and optimize plant performance. Nextracker has operations in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Mexico,\nSpain and other countries in Europe, India, Australia, the Middle East and Africa.\n2. Summary of accounting policies\nVariable interest entities (“VIE”) and consolidation\nThe Company’s sole material asset is its member’s interest in Nextracker LLC. In accordance with the Nextracker LLC Operating Agreement, the Company\nwas named the managing member of Nextracker LLC. As a result, the Company has all management powers over the business and affairs of Nextracker LLC\nand to conduct, direct and exercise full control over the activities of Nextracker LLC. The Company has concluded that Nextracker LLC is a VIE. Due to the\nCompany’s power to control the activities most directly affecting the results of Nextracker LLC, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nAccordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of Nextracker LLC and its subsidiaries. On January 2, 2024, Flex Ltd. (“Flex”) closed the spin-off\nof all its remaining interests in Nextracker LLC common units held by Yuma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Yuma”), Yuma Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Yuma (“Yuma Sub”), to Flex shareholders. As a result of the spin-off, Flex no longer directly or indirectly holds a\nfinancial interest in the Company. Nextracker LLC common units held by Yuma, Yuma Sub, TPG Rise Flash, L.P. (“TPG Rise”) and the following affiliates of\nTPG Inc. (“TPG”): TPG Rise Climate Flash Cl BDH, L.P., TPG Rise Climate BDH, L.P. and The Rise Fund II BDH, L.P. (collectively, the “TPG Affiliates”)\nwere presented on the consolidated balance sheets as temporary equity under the caption “Redeemable non-controlling interests,” up until January 2, 2024 as\nredemption was outside of the control of the Company. Post January 2, 2024, redemption is no longer outside the control of the Company subsequent to the\nspin-off from Flex and, therefore, the non-controlling interests owned by the TPG Affiliates are now presented on the consolidated balance sheets as permanent\nequity under the caption “non-controlling interests.”\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for reporting financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all\nof the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered\nnecessary to present the Company’s financial statements fairly have been included. Operating results for the three and six-month periods ended September 27,\n2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 or any future period. The condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. All\nintercompany transactions and accounts within Nextracker have been eliminated.\nThe first quarters for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 ended on June 28, 2024 (89 days) and June 30, 2023 (91 days), respectively. The second quarters for fiscal\nyears 2025 and 2024 ended on September 27, 2024 (91 days) and September 29, 2023 (91 days), respectively.\nTranslation of foreign currencies\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (“USD”). The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is primarily the USD.\nTransaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are\nincluded in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when realized. The\nCompany recognized foreign currency exchange gains of $2.4 million during the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 driven by favorable exchange\nrate fluctuations in Europe. Additionally, during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, the Company recognized foreign currency exchange losses of\n$7.4 million due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations primarily in Latin\n8\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nAmerica. The Company recognized $3.0 million and $2.6 million foreign currency exchange losses during the three and six-month periods ended\nSeptember 29, 2023, respectively, due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations in certain currencies.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things:\nimpairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for credit losses, provision for excess or obsolete inventories, valuation of deferred tax\nassets, warranty reserves, contingencies, operation-related accruals, fair values of awards granted under stock-based compensation plans and fair values of\nassets obtained and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Due to geopolitical conflicts (including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas\nconflict), there has been and will continue to be uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The Company has made estimates and\nassumptions taking into consideration certain possible impacts due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict. These estimates may\nchange as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be\nmaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in\nthe period they occur. Management believes that these estimates and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for business acquisitions\nFrom time to time, the Company pursues business acquisitions. The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included\nin the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates forward. The Company is required to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period. Estimates are used in accounting for,\namong other things, the fair value of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, contingent earnout, useful lives of plant and\nequipment and amortizable lives for acquired intangible assets. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified assets and\nliabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill.\nThe Company estimates the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time. The\nvaluation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further review from management and may change materially between\nthe preliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period. Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nProduct warranty\nNextracker offers an assurance type warranty for its products against defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period ranging from five to ten years,\ndepending on the component. For these assurance type warranties, a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty expense is recorded when they are\nprobable and reasonably estimable, which is typically when products are delivered. The estimated warranty liability is based on our warranty model, which\nrelies on historical warranty claim information and assumptions based on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims for each product line by project.\nWhen little or no experience exists, the estimate is based on comparable product lines and/or estimated potential failure rates. These estimates are based on data\nfrom Nextracker specific projects. Estimates related to the outstanding warranty liability are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis using best-available information\nand revisions are made as necessary.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the estimated accrued warranty reserve for the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and\nSeptember 29, 2023:\nSix-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 12,511 $ 22,591\nProvision (release) for warranties issued 5,268 (2,614)\nPayments (2,879) (883)\nEnding balance $ 14,900 $ 19,094\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, or net realizable value. Nextracker’s inventory primarily consists of finished\ngoods to be used and to be sold to customers, including components procured to complete the tracker system projects.\nOther current assets\nOther current assets includes short-term deposits and advances of $74.3 million and $104.7 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively,\nprimarily related to advance payments to certain vendors for procurement of inventory. In addition, it includes $167.2 million and $125.4 million as of\nSeptember 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, in vendor rebates receivable related to the 45X Credit as described under the section “Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 Vendor Rebates” of Note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K.\nDeferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets of $472.4 million and $438.3 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, are primarily related to the Company’s\ninvestment in Nextracker LLC as described in Note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K and release of valuation\nallowance related to the acquired foundations business acquisitions described in Note 11.\nAccrued expenses\nAccrued expenses include accruals primarily for freight and tariffs of $50.6 million and $43.2 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024,\nrespectively. In addition, it includes $26.5 million and $39.2 million of accrued payroll as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.\nTRA liability\nTRA liability related to the amount expected to be paid to Flex, TPG and the TPG Affiliates pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, were $399.1 million\nand $391.6 million, as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. During the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, a payment of\n$15.5 million was made to Flex, TPG and the TPG Affiliates, which is presented as financing activity on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities primarily consist of the long-term portion of standard product warranty liabilities of $6.3 million and $6.4 million, and the long-term portion of\ndeferred revenue of $95.5 million and $69.3 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncement\nAccounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting—Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board issued a new accounting standard which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses and information used to assess\n10\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nsegment performance. The annual reporting requirements of the new standard is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2025 and interim reporting\nrequirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt the new guidance in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 with an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nBased on Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 provisions, the Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by those sales\nrecorded over time and sales recorded at a point in time. The following table presents Nextracker’s revenue disaggregated based on timing of transfer-point in\ntime and over time for the three and six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In thousands)\nTiming of Transfer\nPoint in time $ 20,286 $ 21,263 $ 31,006 $ 26,904\nOver time 615,285 552,094 1,324,486 1,025,996\nTotal revenue $ 635,571 $ 573,357 $ 1,355,492 $ 1,052,900\nContract balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Nextracker’s contract amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, which generally\ncoincide with the shipment of one or more phases of the project. When billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, a contract asset results. Contract assets\nof $360.0 million and $397.1 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets,\nof which $143.9 million and $141.4 million, respectively, will be invoiced at the end of the projects as they represent funds withheld until the products are\ninstalled by a third party, arranged by the customer, and the project is declared operational. The remaining unbilled receivables will be invoiced throughout the\nproject based on a set billing schedule such as milestones reached or completed rows delivered. Contract assets decreased $37.1 million from March 31, 2024\nto September 27, 2024 due to fluctuations in the timing and volume of billings for the Company’s revenue recognized over time.\nDuring the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, Nextracker converted $133.4 million and $119.2 million of deferred revenue\nto revenue, respectively, which represented 45% and 56%, respectively, of the beginning period balance of deferred revenue.\nRemaining performance obligations\nAs of September 27, 2024, Nextracker had $332.3 million of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to\nrecognize revenue on approximately 71% of these performance obligations in the next 12 months. The remaining long-term unperformed obligation primarily\nrelates to extended warranty and deposits collected in advance on certain tracker projects.\n4. Goodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, the addition in the Company’s goodwill is driven by its acquisitions of Ojjo, Inc. (“Ojjo”) and the solar\nfoundations business held by Solar Pile International (“SPI”) as further described in Note 11.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 (in thousands):\nBalance as of March 31, 2024 $ 265,153\nAdditions 103,565\nPurchase accounting adjustments 1,895\nBalance as of September 27, 2024 $ 370,613\nOther intangible assets\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, the total gross value of other intangible assets increased by $49.7 million as a result of the Company’s\ninitial estimated value of other intangible assets from its business acquisitions, which contributed an additional $31.7 million of developed technology and\n$18.0 million of customer relationships. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.\nThe components of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:\nAs of September 27, 2024 As of March 31, 2024\nGross Net Gross Net\ncarrying Accumulated carrying carrying Accumulated carrying\namount amortization amount amount amortization amount\n(In thousands)\nDeveloped technology $ 31,700 $ (809) $ 30,891 $ — $ — $ —\nCustomer relationships 18,000 (979) 17,021 — — —\nTrade name and other intangibles 3,000 (1,629) 1,371 3,000 (1,454) 1,546\nTotal $ 52,700 $ (3,417) $ 49,283 $ 3,000 $ (1,454) $ 1,546\nThe gross carrying amount of other intangible assets are removed when fully amortized. Total intangible asset amortization expense recognized in operations\nwas immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe estimated future annual amortization expense for other intangible assets is as follows:\nFiscal year ending March 31, Amount\n(In thousands)\n2025 (1) $ 3,560\n2026 7,120\n2027 7,120\n2028 7,091\n2029 6,945\nThereafter 17,447\nTotal amortization expense $ 49,283\n(1) Represents estimated amortization for the remaining fiscal six-month period ending March 31, 2025.\n5. Stock-based compensation\nThe Company adopted the First Amended and Restated 2022 Nextracker LLC Equity Incentive Plan in April 2022 (the “LLC Plan”), which provides for the\nissuance of options, unit appreciation rights, performance units, performance incentive units, restricted incentive units and other unit-based awards to\nemployees, directors and consultants of the Company. Additionally, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering in February 2023 (the “IPO”), the\nCompany approved the Second Amended and Restated 2022 Nextracker Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (together with the LLC Plan, the “2022 Plan”) to reflect,\namong other things, that the underlying equity interests with respect to awards issued under the LLC Plan shall, in lieu of\n12\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\ncommon units of Nextracker LLC, relate to Class A common stock of Nextracker for periods from and after the closing of the IPO.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s stock-based compensation expense:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCost of sales $ 2,481 $ 3,245 $ 6,261 $ 5,171\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 25,417 14,971 40,704 21,686\nResearch and development 1,987 — 4,821 —\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 29,885 $ 18,216 $ 51,786 $ 26,857\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, the Company granted 1.6 million time-based unvested restricted share units (“RSU”) awards to certain\nof its employees under the 2022 Plan. The vesting for these unvested RSU awards is contingent upon time-based vesting with continued service over a three-\nyear period from the grant date, with a portion of the awards vesting at the end of each year. The weighted average fair value per share of the RSUs granted\nduring the period was estimated to be $41.68 per award.\nIn addition, the Company also granted 0.4 million performance-based vesting (“PSU”) awards whereby vesting is generally contingent upon (i) time-based\nvesting with continued service through March 31, 2027, and (ii) the achievement of certain metrics specific to the Company, which could result in a range of 0-\n300% of such PSUs ultimately vesting. The weighted average fair value per share of the PSUs granted during the period was estimated to be $58.30 per award.\nThe fair value of these PSU awards granted during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 was determined using Monte-Carlo simulation models,\nwhich is a probabilistic approach for calculating the fair value of the awards. Also, 0.3 million PSU awards related to the third tranche of performance-based\nawards granted in fiscal year 2023 met the criteria for a grant date under ASC 718 as the performance metrics for these awards were determined during the six-\nmonth period ended September 27, 2024. The weighted average fair value per share of these PSU awards granted in fiscal year 2023 was estimated to be\n$111.56 per award, determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model.\nFurther, the Company granted 0.3 million option awards that will cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject generally to continuous service\nthrough such vesting date. The exercise price for the shares underlying such option is equal to $47.05 per award, which corresponds to the Company’s closing\nprice per share as of the grant date of the awards. The fair value of these option awards granted during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 was\nestimated to be $29.05 based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nAdditionally, during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, an immaterial number of awards were forfeited due to employee terminations.\nThe total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards under the 2022 Plan as of September 27, 2024 was approximately $161.0 million,\nwhich is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\n6. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to Nextracker Inc. common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the applicable periods.\nDiluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from stock-based compensation awards. The potential dilution from awards was computed using the\ntreasury stock method based on the average fair market value of the Company’s common stock for the period. Additionally, the potential dilution impact of\nClass B common stock convertible into Class A common stock was also considered in the calculation.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nThe computation of earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding of the Company’s common stock for the period is presented below:\nThree-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nWeighted average Weighted average\nIncome Income\nshares outstanding Per share shares outstanding Per share\nNumerator Denominator Amount Numerator Denominator Amount\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nBasic EPS\nNet income attributable to Nextracker Inc. common\nstockholders $ 115,391 143,478,959 $ 0.80 $ 39,253 61,721,709 $ 0.64\nEffect of Dilutive Impact\nCommon stock equivalents from Options awards (1) 1,159,734 1,013,988\nCommon stock equivalents from RSUs (2) 1,294,584 1,106,310\nCommon stock equivalents from PSUs (3) 1,237,094 382,624\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests and\ncommon stock equivalent from Class B common stock $ 1,873 1,908,827 $ 42,156 82,916,511\nDiluted EPS\nNet income $ 117,264 149,079,198 $ 0.79 $ 81,409 147,141,142 $ 0.55\n(1) During the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.8 million and 0.5 million of Options awards, respectively, were\nexcluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n(2) During the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.8 million and 0.4 million of RSU awards, respectively, were excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n(3) During the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.7 million and 0.4 million of PSU awards, respectively, were excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nSix-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nWeighted average Weighted average\nIncome Income\nshares outstanding Per share shares outstanding Per share\nNumerator Denominator Amount Numerator Denominator Amount\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nBasic EPS\nNet income attributable to Nextracker Inc. common\nstockholders $ 237,091 142,785,176 $ 1.66 $ 59,682 54,070,140 $ 1.10\nEffect of Dilutive Impact\nCommon stock equivalents from Options awards (1) 1,273,829 955,488\nCommon stock equivalents from RSUs (2) 1,378,883 996,010\nCommon stock equivalents from PSUs (3) 1,235,060 426,199\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests and\ncommon stock equivalent from Class B common stock $ 4,967 2,477,715 $ 85,372 90,560,516\nDiluted EPS\nNet income $ 242,058 149,150,663 $ 1.62 $ 145,054 147,008,353 $ 0.99\n(1) During the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.8 million and 0.5 million of Options awards, respectively, were\nexcluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n(2) During the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.5 million and 0.4 million of RSU awards, respectively, were excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n(3) During the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, approximately 0.7 million and 0.4 million of PSU awards, respectively, were excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact on the weighted-average ordinary share equivalents.\n7. Bank borrowings and long-term debt\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company and Nextracker LLC (the “LLC”), as the borrower, entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the credit agreement,\ndated as of February 13, 2023 (“2023 Credit Agreement” and, together with the Amendment, the “Amended 2023 Credit Agreement”). The Amendment\namended the 2023 Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the aggregate revolving commitments from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion; (ii) provide\nfor a $1.0 billion secured debt basket for surety bonds; (iii) increase the letter of credit capacity from $300.0 million to $500.0 million; and (iv) update various\ncovenants, baskets and thresholds to provide more financing capacity and operational flexibility to the Company and the LLC. Subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the LLC may be permitted to request incremental term loan facilities under the credit facility from one or more lenders. As a result of the\nAmendment, the Company capitalized $6.0 million of issuance cost for the revolver included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As\nof September 27, 2024, no amounts were drawn under the revolving facility, and the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under its\nAmended 2023 Credit Agreement, the term loan and the revolving credit facility.\n8. Commitments and contingencies\nLitigation and other legal matters\nNextracker has accrued for a loss contingency to the extent it believes that losses are probable and estimable. The amounts accrued are not material, but it is\nreasonably possible that actual losses could be in excess of Nextracker’s accrual. Any related\n15\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nexcess loss could have a material adverse effect on Nextracker’s results of operations or cash flows for a particular period or on Nextracker’s financial\ncondition.\nOn February 6, 2024, pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Nextracker LLC (the “LLC Agreement”),\nNextracker LLC made pro rata tax distributions in an aggregate amount of $94.3 million to the common members of the LLC, including an aggregate of\n$48.5 million to Yuma Acquisition Sub LLC and Yuma Subsidiary, Inc. As of the date of the tax distribution, Yuma Acquisition Sub LLC and Yuma Subsidiary\nInc. were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nextracker Inc. On February 1, 2024, Flex sent a dispute notice to Nextracker Inc. asserting that Flex is entitled to the\ndistribution that was subsequently made to Yuma Acquisition Sub LLC and Yuma Subsidiary, Inc. and demanding payment of that amount to Flex. It is too\nearly to determine the likelihood that the Company will be required to make any such payments to Flex in the future.\n9. Income taxes\nThe Company follows the guidance under ASC 740-270, “Interim Reporting,” which requires a company to calculate the income tax associated with ordinary\nincome using an estimated annual effective tax rate (“AETR”). At the end of each interim period, the Company applies the AETR to year-to-date (“YTD”)\nordinary income (or loss) to arrive at the YTD income tax expense. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items in the quarter in which the discrete\nevents occur.\nThe following table presents income tax expense recorded by the Company along with the respective consolidated effective tax rates for each period presented.\nFor the three and six-month periods ended September 27, 2024, the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate of 21% is\nprimarily attributable to the benefit of the foreign derived intangible income deduction and foreign tax credits, partially offset by U.S. state and local income\ntaxes and jurisdictional mix of income between the U.S. and other operating jurisdictions.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, the Company drafted its transfer pricing documentation with respect to the economic arrangement\nbetween Ojjo and Nextracker LLC, whereby Ojjo is compensated for the services that it provides on behalf of Nextracker LLC. Therefore, during the three-\nmonth period ended September 27, 2024, Ojjo updated its forecasted pre-tax earnings to account for the draft of the economic arrangement between these\nparties, which reflects forecasted profits into the future. Due to the transfer pricing methodology, Ojjo is effectively guaranteed a profit going forward. As a\nresult, the Company released the valuation allowance recorded against Ojjo’s deferred tax assets given that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be realized. A $7.9 million income tax benefit was recorded as a discrete item in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 as it relates to a change\nin management’s assertion related to the realization of deferred tax assets in periods beyond the current tax year. An immaterial amount of income tax benefit\nrelated to the utilization of deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance in the current period is appropriately running through the computation of the annual\neffective tax rate.\nFor the three and six-month periods ended September 29, 2023, the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate of 21% is\nprimarily attributable to certain non-controlling interests in Nextracker LLC, which is not taxable to Nextracker Inc. and its subsidiaries, partially offset by U.S.\nstate and local income taxes and the jurisdictional mix of income between the U.S. and other operating jurisdictions. In addition, there was a change in\naccounting estimate related to the Tax Receivable Agreement which resulted in a discrete benefit of $6.7 million.\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nIncome tax 19,928 3,999 47,080 13,100\nEffective tax rates 14.5% 4.7% 16.3% 8.3%\nThe increase in tax expense as well as effective tax rate from the three and six-month periods ended September 29, 2023 to the three and six-month periods\nended September 27, 2024 is driven by an increase in income before income taxes for the corresponding period and an increase in tax rate due to the separation\nfrom Flex as further described in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nTax distributions\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, and pursuant to the LLC Agreement, Nextracker LLC made pro rata tax distributions to its non-\ncontrolling interest holder (TPG) in the aggregate amount of approximately $6.1 million.\n10. Segment reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”), or a decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Resource allocation\ndecisions and Nextracker’s performance are assessed by its Chief Executive Officer, identified as the CODM.\nFor all periods presented, Nextracker has one operating and reportable segment. The following table sets forth geographic information of revenue based on the\nlocations to which the products are shipped:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nRevenue: (In thousands)\nU.S. $ 461,806 $ 382,160 $ 973,288 $ 652,498\nRest of the World 173,765 191,197 382,204 400,402\nTotal $ 635,571 $ 573,357 $ 1,355,492 $ 1,052,900\nThe United States is the principal country of domicile.\n11. Business acquisitions\nFoundations business\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, the Company completed two acquisitions. On June 20, 2024, as part of an all-cash transaction, the\nCompany acquired 100% of the interest in Ojjo, a renewable energy company specializing in foundations technology and services used in ground-mount\napplications for solar power generation. Additionally, on July 31, 2024, the Company closed the acquisition of the solar foundations business held by SPI\nthrough the purchase of Spinex Systems Inc. and assets held by other SPI affiliates.\nThe acquisitions of Ojjo and the foundations business of SPI (“Foundations acquisitions”) expand the Company’s foundations offering by accelerating its\ncapability to offer customers a more complete integrated solution for solar trackers and foundations. The development of any utility-scale project is a long and\ncomplex process. Foundations are a key part of every utility-scale solar project installation. In addition, projects are often confronted with unique challenges\nrelated to land use considerations and exceptional variation in subsurface conditions. The Company believes there is additional value for its customers in\ncombining tracker systems and foundations to form an integrated solution, particularly for difficult and unique soil conditions.\nThe aggregate cash consideration of the Foundations acquisitions was approximately $144.7 million, net of $4.4 million cash acquired. Additionally, the\naggregate total purchase price of $164.7 million includes $14.0 million of deferred consideration expected to be paid within a 12-month period, a $3.4 million\nrelease of a loan obligation previously owed by the seller and a $2.6 million contingent earnout.\nThe contingent earnout has a maximum possible consideration of $6.0 million upon the achievement of future revenue performance targets, measured in\nmegawatts (“MW”), over a four-year period starting October 1, 2024. The fair value of the contingent earnout liability as of the acquisition date was estimated\nto be $2.6 million based on a Monte-Carlo simulation model, which is a probabilistic approach used to simulate future revenue and calculate the potential\ncontingent consideration payments for each simulated path. The inputs are unobservable in the market and therefore categorized as Level 3 inputs in the fair\nvalue measurement.\nThe Company incurred approximately $3.7 million of acquisition costs which are presented as selling, general and administrative expenses on the condensed\nconsolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their preliminary estimated fair values as of the date of acquisitions. The excess of the purchase price over\nthe tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is not deductible for\n17\nTable of Contents\nNEXTRACKER\nNotes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nincome tax purposes. The results of operations of the acquisitions were included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements beginning on\nthe date of acquisition and were not material for all periods presented.\nAdditional information, which existed as of the acquisition dates, may become known to the Company during the remainder of the measurement period, a\nperiod not to exceed 12 months from the date of the relevant acquisition. Changes to amounts recorded as assets and liabilities may result in a corresponding\nadjustment to goodwill during the respective measurement period.\nThe following represents the Company’s preliminary allocation of the Foundations acquisitions total aggregate purchase price to the acquired assets and\nliabilities (in thousands):\nCurrent assets $ 5,547\nProperty and equipment 23,977\nIntangible assets 49,700\nGoodwill 105,460\nOther assets 4,232\nTotal assets 188,916\nCurrent liabilities 17,467\nOther liabilities, non-current 6,732\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 164,717\nIntangible assets are comprised of $31.7 million of developed technology to be amortized over an estimated useful life of ten years, and $18.0 million of\ncustomer relationships to be amortized over an estimated useful life of five years. The fair value assigned to the identified intangible assets was estimated based\non an income approach, which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that the acquired business is expected to generate in\nthe future. Key assumptions used in the valuation included forecasted revenues, cost of sales and operating expenses, royalty rate, discount rate and weighted\naverage cost of capital. The useful life of the acquired intangible assets for amortization purposes was determined by considering the period of expected cash\nflows used to measure the fair values of the asset, adjusted for certain factors that may limit the useful life.\nPro-forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects were not material to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial results for all\nperiods presented.\nITEM 2.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial\ncondition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto\nincluded elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 (this “Quarterly Report”) and our audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024,\nfiled with the SEC on May 28, 2024, as amended by our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on June 6, 2024. In addition to historical financial\ninformation, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the\n18\n“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such statements are based upon current\nexpectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those results anticipated and discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements as a result of many factors. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the sections\nbelow titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors.” All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us\nas of the date of this Quarterly Report and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of intelligent, integrated solar tracker, foundations, and software solutions used in utility-scale and ground-mounted distributed\ngeneration solar projects around the world. Our products enable solar PV power plants to follow the sun’s movement across the sky and optimize plant\nperformance. With power plants operating in more than 40 countries worldwide, we offer solar tracker technologies that increase energy production while\nreducing costs for significant plant return on investment (“ROI”). We are the global market leader based on gigawatts (“GW”) shipped for eight consecutive\nyears.\nWe were founded in 2013 by our Chief Executive Officer, Dan Shugar, and were acquired by Flex in 2015. In 2016, Flex acquired BrightBox Technologies on\nour behalf to further our machine learning capabilities. On January 2, 2024, Flex closed the spin-off of all its remaining interests in Nextracker to Flex\nshareholders and we are now a fully independent company. Over time, we have developed new and innovative hardware and software products and services to\nscale our capabilities.\nWe have shipped more than 100 GW of solar tracker systems as of September 27, 2024 to projects on six continents for use in utility-scale and distributed\ngeneration solar applications. Our customers include engineering, procurement and construction firms (“EPCs”), as well as solar project developers and\nowners. Developers originate projects, select and acquire sites, obtain permits, select contractors, negotiate power offtake agreements and oversee the building\nof projects. EPCs design and optimize the system, procure components, build and commission the plant and operate the plant for a limited time until transfer to\na long-term owner. Owners, which are often independent power producers, own and operate the plant, typically as part of a portfolio of similar assets. Owners\ngenerate cash flows through the sale of electricity to utilities, wholesale markets or end users.\nFor the majority of our projects, our direct customer is the EPC. We also engage with project owners and developers and enter into master supply agreements\nthat cover multiple projects. We are a qualified, preferred provider to some of the largest solar EPCs, project owners and developers in the world. We had\nrevenues of $1.4 billion for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 and $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2024.\nBusiness acquisitions\nDuring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, we completed two acquisitions. On June 20, 2024, as part of an all-cash transaction, we acquired\n100% of the interest in Ojjo, Inc. (“Ojjo”), a renewable energy company specializing in foundations technology and services used in ground-mount applications\nfor solar power generation. Additionally, on July 31, 2024, we closed the acquisition of the solar foundations business held by Solar Pile International (“SPI”)\nthrough the purchase of Spinex Systems Inc. and assets held by other SPI affiliates.\nThe acquisitions of Ojjo and the foundations business of SPI (“Foundations acquisitions”) expand our foundations offering by accelerating our capability to\noffer customers a more complete integrated solution for solar trackers and foundations. The development of any utility-scale project is a long and complex\nprocess. Foundations are a key part of every utility-scale solar project installation. In addition, projects are often confronted with unique challenges related to\nland use considerations and exceptional variation in subsurface conditions. We believe there is additional value for our customers in combining tracker systems\nand foundations to form an integrated solution, particularly for difficult and unique soil conditions.\nThe aggregate cash consideration of the Foundations acquisitions was approximately $144.7 million, net of $4.4 million cash acquired. Additionally, the\naggregate total purchase price of $164.7 million includes $14.0 million of deferred consideration expected to be paid within a 12-month period, a $3.4 million\nrelease of a loan obligation previously owed by the seller and a $2.6 million contingent earnout. See Note 11 in the notes to the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for further detail on these acquisitions.\n19\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”)\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law, which includes a new corporate minimum tax, a stock repurchase excise tax, numerous green energy\ncredits, other tax provisions and significantly increased enforcement resources. The Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Advanced\nManufacturing Production Credit (“45X Credit”), which was established as part of the IRA, is a per-unit tax credit earned over time for each clean energy\ncomponent domestically produced and sold by a manufacturer.\nWe have executed agreements with certain suppliers to ramp up our U.S. manufacturing footprint. These suppliers produce 45X Credit eligible parts, including\ntorque tubes and structural fasteners, that will then be incorporated into a solar tracker. The 45X Credit was eligible for domestic parts manufactured after\nJanuary 1, 2023. We have contractually agreed with these suppliers to share a portion of the economic value of the credit related to our purchases in the form of\na vendor rebate. We account for these vendor rebate amounts as a reduction of the purchase price of the parts acquired from the vendor and therefore a\nreduction of inventory until the control of the part is transferred to the customer, at which point we recognize such amounts as a reduction of cost of sales on\nthe consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we determined the amount and collectability of\nthe 45X Credit vendor rebates we expect to receive in accordance with the vendor contracts and recognized a cumulative reduction to cost of sales of\n$121.4 million related to 45X Credit vendor rebates earned on production of eligible components shipped to projects starting on January 1, 2023 through\nMarch 31, 2024.\nThe following tables set forth geographic information of revenue based on the locations to which the products are shipped:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nRevenue: (In thousands, except percentages)\nU.S. $ 461,806 73% $ 382,160 67% $ 973,288 72% $ 652,498 62%\nRest of the World 173,765 27% 191,197 33% 382,204 28% $ 400,402 38%\nTotal $ 635,571 $ 573,357 $ 1,355,492 $ 1,052,900\nThe following table sets forth the revenue from customers that individually accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue during the periods included below:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In millions)\nCustomer G $ 83.4 $ 90.9 $ 192.7 $ 137.3\nCritical accounting policies and significant management estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those\nestimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things: impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for credit losses,\nprovision for excess or obsolete inventories, valuation of deferred tax assets, warranty reserves, contingencies, operation-related accruals, fair values of awards\ngranted under stock-based compensation plans and fair values of assets obtained and liabilities assumed in business combinations. We periodically review\nestimates and assumptions, and the effects of our revisions are reflected in the period they occur. We believe that these estimates and assumptions provide a\nreasonable basis for the fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRefer to the critical accounting policies and significant management estimates under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”), where we discussed our more\nsignificant policies and estimates used in the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to\nthe Company’s critical accounting estimates since the Form 10-K, other than our accounting for business acquisitions as disclosed below.\n20\nAccounting for business acquisitions\nFrom time to time, we pursue business acquisitions. The fair value of the net assets acquired and the results of the acquired businesses are included in our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the acquisition dates forward. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and results of operations during the reporting period. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, the fair\nvalue of acquired net operating assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, contingent earnout, useful lives of plant and equipment and amortizable lives\nfor acquired intangible assets. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired is recognized as\ngoodwill.\nWe estimate the preliminary fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition based on information available at that time. The valuation\nof these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is subject to further review from management and may change materially between the\npreliminary allocation and end of the purchase price allocation period. Any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on our unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial position and results of operations.\nKey components of our results of operations\nThe following discussion describes certain line items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from the sale of solar trackers and software products to our customers. Our revenue growth is dependent on (i) our ability to maintain\nand expand our market share, (ii) total market growth and (iii) our ability to develop and introduce new products driving performance enhancements and cost\nefficiencies throughout the solar power plant.\nCost of sales and gross profit\nCost of sales consists primarily of purchased components net of any incentives or rebates earned from our suppliers, shipping and other logistics costs,\napplicable tariffs, standard product warranty costs, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation and direct labor. Direct labor\ncosts represent expenses of personnel directly related to project execution such as supply chain, logistics, quality, tooling, operations and customer satisfaction.\nAmortization of intangibles consists of developed technology and certain acquired patents over its expected period of use and is also included under cost of\nsales.\nSteel prices, cost of transportation and labor costs in countries where our suppliers perform manufacturing activities affect our cost of sales. Our ability to\nlower our cost of sales depends on implementation and design improvements to our products as well as on driving more cost-effective manufacturing processes\nwith our suppliers. We generally do not directly purchase raw materials such as steel or electronic components and do not hedge against changes in their price.\nMost of our cost of sales are directly affected by sales volume. Personnel costs related to our supply chain, logistics, quality, tooling and operations are not\ndirectly impacted by our sales volume.\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our administrative and support functions. These costs\ninclude, among other things, personnel costs, stock-based compensation, facilities charges including depreciation associated with administrative functions,\nprofessional services, travel expenses and allowance for bad debt. Professional services include audit, legal, tax and other consulting services. We have\nexpanded our sales organization and expect to continue growing our sales headcount to support our planned growth. We have incurred and expect to continue\nto incur on an ongoing basis certain new costs related to the requirements of being a publicly traded company, including insurance, accounting, tax, legal and\nother professional services costs, which could be material. Amortization of intangibles consists of customer relationships and trade names over their expected\nperiod of use and is also included under selling, general and administrative expenses.\n21\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs associated with our engineering employees, stock-based compensation, as well\nas third-party consulting. Research and development activities include improvements to our existing products, development of new tracker products and\nsoftware products. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred. We expect that the dollar amount of research and development\nexpenses will increase in amount over time.\nIncome tax expense\nOur taxable income is primarily from the allocation of taxable income from the LLC. The provision for income taxes primarily represents the LLC’s U.S.\nfederal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes payable by its subsidiaries. The LLC owns 100% of all foreign subsidiaries. We expect to\nreceive a tax benefit for foreign tax credits in the United States for our distributive shares of the foreign tax paid.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes\nthereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nIn addition, reference should be made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of\nOperations and Comprehensive Income\nData: (In thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue $ 635,571 $ 573,357 11 % $ 1,355,492 $ 1,052,900 29 %\nCost of sales 410,776 424,247 (3) 893,257 790,046 13\nGross profit 224,795 149,110 51 462,235 262,854 76\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 72,127 47,872 51 132,954 82,107 62\nResearch and development 19,193 7,146 169 35,712 12,775 180\nOperating income 133,475 94,092 42 293,569 167,972 75\nInterest expense 3,665 3,646 1 6,945 6,748 3\nOther (income) expense, net (7,382) 5,038 (247) (2,514) 3,070 (182)\nIncome before income taxes 137,192 85,408 61 289,138 158,154 83\nProvision for income taxes 19,928 3,999 398 47,080 13,100 259\nNet income and comprehensive income $ 117,264 $ 81,409 44 % $ 242,058 $ 145,054 67 %\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net income margin\nand Adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental measures of our performance. We define Adjusted gross profit as gross profit plus stock-based compensation\nexpense and intangible amortization. We define Adjusted operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation expense, intangible\namortization and non-recurring integration activities related to our current year acquisitions. We define Adjusted net income as net income (loss) plus stock-\nbased compensation expense, intangible amortization, non-recurring integration activities related to acquisitions and certain nonrecurring legal costs and other\ndiscrete events as applicable, net of their tax effects. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net\n22\nincome (loss) plus (i) interest, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) depreciation expense, (iv) intangible amortization, (v) stock-based compensation\nexpense, (vi) various non-recurring tax adjustments and (vii) certain nonrecurring legal costs, integration activities related to acquisitions and other discrete\nevents as applicable. We define Adjusted gross margin as the percentage derived from Adjusted gross profit divided by revenue. We define Adjusted net income\nmargin as the percentage derived from Adjusted net income divided by revenue. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the percentage derived from Adjusted\nEBITDA divided by revenue.\nAdjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted\nEBITDA margin are intended as supplemental measures of performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We present\nthese Adjusted financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent\nbasis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we may use all or any combination of Adjusted\ngross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, when determining incentive compensation and to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our business strategies.\nAmong other limitations, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income margin, Adjusted\ngross margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future capital expenditures or contractual commitments (including under the\nTax Receivable Agreement, as defined below), do not reflect the impact of certain cash or non-cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be\nindicative of our ongoing operations and do not reflect the associated income tax expense or benefit related to those charges. In addition, other companies in\nour industry may calculate Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net\nincome margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently from us, which further limits their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net\nincome margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted financial measures on a supplemental\nbasis. You should review the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure of Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted\nnet income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted net income margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin below and not rely on any single financial\nmeasure to evaluate our business.\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nOther Financial Information: (In thousands, except percentages)\nAdjusted gross profit $ 228,172 $ 152,417 $ 469,480 $ 268,150\nAdjusted operating income 167,412 112,370 350,975 194,954\nAdjusted net income 144,927 96,031 283,546 167,155\nAdjusted EBITDA 172,651 110,198 347,627 194,051\nAdjusted gross margin 35.9% 26.6% 34.6% 25.5%\nAdjusted net income margin 22.8% 16.7% 20.9% 15.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 27.2% 19.2% 25.6% 18.4%\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit to Adjusted gross profit, operating income to Adjusted operating income, net income to Adjusted\nnet income, net income to Adjusted EBITDA, gross margin to Adjusted gross margin, net income margin to Adjusted net income margin, and net income\nmargin to Adjusted EBITDA margin for each period presented.

We do not believe that the acquisition transaction costs are normal,\nrecurring operating expenses indicative of our core operating performance, nor were these charges taken into account as factors in evaluating management’s performance\nwhen determining incentive compensation or to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.\nThe data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations.\nComparison of the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $62.2 million, or 11%, for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29,\n2023, resulting primarily from a 27% increase in gigawatts delivered, most notably in the U.S. driven by increased demand coupled with an acceleration of\ndeliveries to meet customers’ updated project schedules, partially offset by continued declines in average selling prices resulting from declining costs per watt.\nRevenue increased approximately $79.6 million, or 21%, in the U.S. during the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the\n24\nthree-month period ended September 29, 2023 while decreasing $17.4 million, or 9%, in the Rest of the World during the same period, primarily due to a\nreduction in shipments in Latin America. Quarterly variability occurs based on specific project timing and may be impacted negatively by delays in\nconstruction caused by multiple factors including permitting, interconnection, weather and labor issues.\nCost of sales and gross profit\nCost of sales decreased by $13.5 million, or 3%, during the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended\nSeptember 29, 2023, primarily driven by the impact from the 45X Credit. As noted in the overview, we now recognize a reduction in cost of sales for 45X\nCredit earned on components manufactured in the U.S. During the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, we recognized approximately $50.7 million\nof reduction to cost of sales related to the 45X Credit earned on production of eligible components shipped during the period. Additional incremental cost\nsavings, primarily related to materials we procured from our vendors, were achieved through our expanded global supply chain that allows us to source local\nmaterial and provides better lead times for customers. Freight and logistics costs remained flat as a percentage of revenue during the three-month period ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 29, 2023.\nGross profit increased by $75.7 million, or 51%, during the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended\nSeptember 29, 2023, primarily resulting from the impact from the 45X Credit recognized in the period. Additional margin improvement was driven by a\nslightly higher mix of U.S. revenue that generally carries a higher margin profile than the Rest of the World coupled with incremental cost savings achieved\nthrough our global supply chain.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $24.3 million, or 51%, to $72.1 million for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 from\napproximately $47.9 million for the three-month period ended September 29, 2023 while also increasing approximately 300 basis points from approximately\n8% to approximately 11% as a percentage of revenue during the same period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the\nresult of an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million incurred in conjunction with our 2022 equity incentive plan, the remaining increase\nin costs of approximately $13.9 million related to our continued expansion of our sales organization in line with the growth in the global market and the\nexpansion of our supporting functions also required to support our planned growth.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased $12.0 million, or 169%, to $19.2 million for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 from\napproximately $7.1 million during the three-month period ended September 29, 2023 as a result of our commitment to product innovation and development,\nincluding software enhancements and additional headcount, coupled with an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense remained relatively flat at approximately $3.7 million for both three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023,\nrespectively.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net was a $7.4 million income for the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, which primarily included $3.3 million of interest\nincome and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency exchange gains. Other (income) expense, net was a $5.0 million expense for the three-month period\nended September 29, 2023, which primarily included $5.7 million tax related expense as a result of an increase in our liability under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement, and $3.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by $3.7 million of interest income.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe accrue and pay income taxes according to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate. Most of our revenue and profits are generated\nin the United States with a statutory income tax rate of approximately 21% for the three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023. For\nthe three-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and\n25\nSeptember 29, 2023, we recorded total income tax expense of $19.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, which reflected consolidated effective income tax\nrates of 15% and 5%, respectively. The increase in tax expense as well as effective tax rate from the three-month period ended September 29, 2023 to the three-\nmonth period ended September 27, 2024 is driven by an increase in income before income taxes for the corresponding period and an increase in tax rate due to\nthe separation from Flex as further described in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 27, 2024, the Company drafted its transfer pricing documentation with respect to the economic arrangement\nbetween Ojjo and Nextracker LLC, whereby Ojjo is compensated for the services that it provides on behalf of Nextracker LLC. Therefore, during the three-\nmonth period ended September 27, 2024, Ojjo updated its forecasted pre-tax earnings to account for the draft of the economic arrangement between these\nparties, which reflects forecasted profits into the future. Due to the transfer pricing methodology, Ojjo is effectively guaranteed a profit going forward. As a\nresult, the Company released the valuation allowance recorded against Ojjo’s deferred tax assets given that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be realized. A $7.9 million income tax benefit was recorded as a discrete item in the three-month period ended September 27, 2024 as it relates to a change\nin management’s assertion related to the realization of deferred tax assets in periods beyond the current tax year. An immaterial amount of income tax benefit\nrelated to the utilization of deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance in the current period is appropriately running through the computation of the annual\neffective tax rate.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to income and non-income based tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of tax liabilities involves\ndealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. Due to such complexity of these uncertainties,\nthe ultimate resolution may result in a payment or refund that is materially different from our estimates.\nComparison of the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by $302.6 million, or 29%, for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended September 29,\n2023, driven by a 44% increase in GW delivered, most notably in the U.S. driven by increased demand coupled with an acceleration of deliveries to meet\ncustomers updated project schedules. The revenue increase from additional GW delivered was slightly offset by a reduction in revenue per watt due to\ndeclining costs per watt compared to the six-month period ended September 29, 2023. Revenue increased approximately $320.8 million, or 49%, in the U.S.\nduring the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended September 29, 2023 as more projects came on line, Rest of the\nWorld decreased $18.2 million, or 5%, primarily from reduced shipments to Latin America.\nCost of sales and gross profit\nCost of sales increased by $103.2 million, or 13%, during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended\nSeptember 29, 2023, primarily driven by the 44% increase in GW delivered noted above, partially offset by the impact from the 45X Credit. As noted in the\noverview, we now recognize a reduction in cost of sales for the 45X Credit earned on components manufactured in the U.S. During the first half of fiscal year\n2025, we recognized approximately $98.0 million of reduction to cost of sales related to the 45X Credit earned on production of eligible components shipped\nduring the period. Additional incremental cost savings, primarily related to materials we procured from our vendors, were achieved through our expanded\nglobal supply chain that allows us to source local materials and provide better lead times for customers. Freight and logistics costs remained flat as a percentage\nof revenue during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended September 29, 2023.\nGross profit increased by $199.4 million, or 76%, during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended\nSeptember 29, 2023, primarily resulting from the U.S. revenue growth noted above and the impact from the 45X Credit recognized in the first half of fiscal\nyear 2025. In addition, throughout fiscal year 2024 and into fiscal year 2025, we continue to implement enhancements to our overall margin structure that\ninclude maintaining pricing discipline, expanding our global supply chain and other innovations that drive cost savings. As a percentage of revenue, these\nefforts increased gross margins by approximately 200 basis points during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 compared to the six-month period\nended September 29, 2023 and were net of the impact from competitive pressures that have lowered prices.\n26\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $50.8 million, or 62%, to $133.0 million for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 from\napproximately $82.1 million for the six-month period ended September 29, 2023 while also increasing approximately 201 basis points from approximately 8%\nto over 10% as a percentage of revenue during the same period. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of an\nincrease in stock-based compensation expense of $19.0 million incurred in conjunction with our 2022 equity incentive plan, the remaining increase in costs of\napproximately $31.8 million related to our continued expansion of our sales organization in line with the growth in the global market and the expansion of our\nsupporting functions also required to support our planned growth.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses increased $22.9 million, or 180%, to $35.7 million for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 from\napproximately $12.8 million during the six-month period ended September 29, 2023 as a result of our commitment to product innovation and development\nincluding software enhancements and additional headcount, coupled with an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $4.8 million.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense modestly increased $0.2 million, or 3%, to $6.9 million, for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 from $6.7 million during the six-\nmonth period ended September 29, 2023.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net was $2.5 million income for the six-month period ended September 27, 2024, which primarily included $8.0 million interest\nincome, partially offset by $7.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses. Other (income) expense, net was $3.1 million expense for the six-\nmonth period ended September 29, 2023, which primarily included $5.7 million tax related expense as a result of an increase in our liability under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement and $2.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by $5.3 million of interest income during the period.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe accrue and pay income taxes according to the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate. Most of our revenue and profits are generated\nin the United States with a statutory income tax rate of approximately 21% for the six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023. For\nthe six-month periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, we recorded total income tax expense of $47.1 million and $13.1 million,\nrespectively, which reflected consolidated effective income tax rates of 16% and 8%, respectively. The increase in tax expense as well as effective tax rate from\nthe six-month period ended September 29, 2023 to the six-month period ended September 27, 2024 is driven by an increase in income before income taxes for\nthe corresponding period and an increase in tax rate due to the separation from Flex as further described in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements in the Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal uses of cash have been to fund our operations and invest in research and development and our cash flow generation and credit facilities have\ncontinued to provide adequate liquidity for our business.\nCredit Facilities\nOn June 21, 2024, Nextracker Inc. and the LLC, as the borrower, entered into the Amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement. The Amendment amended the\n2023 Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the aggregate commitments of the revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) from $500.0 million to\n$1.0 billion; (ii) provide for a $1.0 billion secured debt basket for surety bonds; (iii) increase the letter of credit capacity from $300.0 million to $500.0 million;\nand (iv) update various covenants, baskets and thresholds to provide more financing capacity and operational flexibility to Nextracker Inc. and the LLC.\nSubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the LLC may be permitted to request incremental term loan facilities under the credit facility from one or more\nlenders.\nThe RCF under the 2023 Credit Agreement is available in U.S. dollars, euros and such currencies as mutually agreed on a revolving basis during the five-year\nperiod through February 11, 2028. A portion of the RCF not to exceed $500.0 million is\n27\navailable for the issuance of letters of credit. A portion of the RCF not to exceed $50.0 million is available for swing line loans. Subject to the satisfaction of\ncertain conditions, the LLC will be permitted to incur incremental term loan facilities or increase the RCF commitment in an aggregate principal amount equal\nto $257.5 million plus an additional amount such that the secured net leverage ratio or total net leverage ratio, as applicable, is equal to or less than a specified\nthreshold after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence.\nThe obligations of the LLC under the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement and related loan documents are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nextracker Inc.,\ncertain other holding companies (collectively, the “Guarantors”) and, subject to certain exclusions, certain of the LLC’s existing and future direct and indirect\nwholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.\nAs of the closing of the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement, all obligations of the LLC and the Guarantors were secured by certain equity pledges by the LLC\nand the Guarantors. However, if the LLC’s total net leverage ratio exceeds a specified threshold, the collateral will include substantially all the assets of the\nLLC and the Guarantors and, if the LLC meets certain investment grade conditions, such lien will be released.\nThe term loan facility (“Term Loan”) under the 2023 Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments beginning on June 30, 2024, in an amount equal\nto 0.625% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan. From June 30, 2025, the quarterly principal payment will increase to 1.25% of the\noriginal aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan. The remaining balance of the Term Loan and the outstanding balance of any RCF loans will be\nrepayable on February 11, 2028. Borrowings under the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement are prepayable and commitments subject to being reduced in each\ncase at the LLC’s option without premium or penalty. The Amended 2023 Credit Agreement contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event\nthat the LLC or its restricted subsidiaries incur certain types of indebtedness or, subject to certain reinvestment rights, receive net cash proceeds from certain\nasset sales or other dispositions of property.\nBorrowings in U.S. dollars under the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate based on either (a) a term secured overnight financing rate\n(“SOFR”) based formula (including a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin of 162.5 basis points to 200 basis points, depending on the\nLLC’s total net leverage ratio, or (b) a base rate formula plus a margin of 62.5 basis points to 100 basis points, depending on the LLC’s total net leverage ratio.\nBorrowings under the RCF in euros bear interest based on the adjusted EURIBOR rate plus a margin of 162.5 basis points to 200 basis points, depending on\nthe LLC’s total net leverage ratio. The LLC is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the RCF commitments of 20 basis points\nto 35 basis points, depending on the LLC’s total net leverage ratio. The interest rate for the Term Loan was 6.53% (SOFR rate of 4.80% plus a margin of\n1.73%) as of September 27, 2024.\nThe Amended 2023 Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the\nability of the LLC and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, change their fiscal year or lines of business, pay\ndividends and other restricted payments, make investments and other acquisitions, make optional payments of subordinated and junior lien debt, enter into\ntransactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements. In addition, the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement requires the LLC to maintain a consolidated\ntotal net leverage ratio below a certain threshold. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Amended 2023\nCredit Agreement, the Term Loan and the RCF.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the IPO, on February 13, 2023, Nextracker Inc. also entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) that\nprovided for the payment by us to Flex, TPG Rise and the following affiliates of TPG Rise: TPG Rise Climate Flash Cl BDH, L.P., TPG Rise Climate BDH,\nL.P. and The Rise Fund II BDH, L.P. (collectively, the “TPG Affiliates”) (or certain permitted transferees thereof) of 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we are\ndeemed to realize under certain circumstances, as more fully described in the Form 10-K. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result\nof timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes\nsubject to the Tax Receivable Agreement or distributions to us by the LLC are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement after we have paid taxes. Prior to the separation from Flex, Yuma and Yuma Sub assigned their respective rights under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement to an entity that remains an affiliate of Flex.\nWe believe that our cash provided by operations and other existing and committed sources of liquidity, including our RCF, will provide adequate liquidity for\nongoing operations, planned capital expenditures and other investments, potential debt service requirements and payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement for at least the next 12 months.\n28\nCash Flows Analysis\nSix-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 274,627 $ 252,677\nNet cash used in investing activities (159,575) (1,406)\nNet cash used in financing activities (27,222) (8,361)\nSix-month period ended September 27, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $274.6 million during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024. Total cash provided during the period\nwas driven by net income of $242.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges of approximately $57.2 million primarily related to stock-based compensation\nexpense, depreciation and amortization and provision for credit losses, partially offset by deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nCash from net income was further decreased by the overall increase in our net operating assets and liabilities, primarily our net working capital accounts,\nresulting in an outflow of approximately $24.6 million. Accounts payable decreased $53.3 million, partially associated with timing and a decrease in payment\ncycle, other liabilities decreased $67.2 million primarily due to decrease in accrued expense, and other assets increased $16.1 million driven by advance\npayments to suppliers. Partially offsetting the cash outflows were decreases in inventory of $27.2 million as we continue to transfer production to the U.S. and\nshrink lead times, decreases in account receivable, contract assets in the aggregate of $61.6 million due to a reduction in revenue, the timing of billings and\ndeliveries, and increases in deferred revenue of $23.3 million driven primarily by increased deposits on higher bookings during the period.\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $159.6 million and directly attributable to the $144.7 million payment for the Foundations acquisitions\nnet of cash acquired, coupled with the purchase of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $27.2 million primarily resulting from a $15.5 million payment to Flex, TPG and the TPG Affiliates pursuant to the\nTax Receivable Agreement, $6.1 million of tax distributions to our non-controlling interest holders pursuant to the LLC Agreement and a $3.7 million payment\nof the RCF issuance costs.\nSix-month period ended September 29, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $252.7 million during the six-month period ended September 29, 2023. Total cash provided during the period\nwas driven by net income of $145.1 million adjusted for non-cash charges of approximately $2.0 million primarily related to depreciation and amortization.\nCash from net income was increased by the overall decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities, primarily our net working capital accounts, resulting in\nan inflow of approximately $105.6 million. Accounts payable increased approximately $191.4 million, partially associated with timing and increase in our\npayment cycles. Deferred revenue increased approximately $82.1 million driven primarily by increased deposits on higher bookings during the quarter.\nOffsetting the cash inflows were increases in accounts receivable and contract assets in aggregate of approximately $82.3 million during the six-month period\nended September 29, 2023, resulting from shorter billing and collection periods and lower sequential revenue, and increases in inventories of approximately\n$58.2 million due to strong demand. Other net assets increased approximately $99.2 million driven by advance payments to suppliers to secure product with\nlonger lead times and drive growth of our U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million and directly attributable to the purchase of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8.4 million resulting from our repayment to Flex for the cash pool payable outstanding to Flex. After repaying such\namount to Flex, no such cash pool payable is outstanding as of September 29, 2023.\nCash management and financing\nWe had a total liquidity of over $1.5 billion as of September 27, 2024, primarily related to unutilized amounts under the RCF net of cumulative letters of credit\nissued in conjunction with our customer contracts, and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 27, 2024.\n29\nContractual obligations and commitments\nAs discussed in the “Credit Facilities” section above, in June 2024, we entered into an amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement, which, among other things,\nincreased our revolving commitment.\nInformation regarding our debt obligation, operating lease commitments and other commitments is provided in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Form 10-K.\nThere were no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 27, 2024.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nNone during the six-month period ended September 27, 2024.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to\nadverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in commodity prices, such as steel and\ncustomer concentrations. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and had $146.1 million outstanding under our Term Loan, net of\nissuance costs as of September 27, 2024.\nThere were no material changes in our exposure to market risks for changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates for the six-month period ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\nConcentration of major customers\nOur customer base consists primarily of EPCs, as well as solar project owners and developers. We do not require collateral on our trade receivables. The loss of\nany one of our top five customers could have a materially adverse effect on our revenue and profits.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue from our customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenue and the total revenue from our five largest customers by\npercentage of our total revenue during the periods included below:\nThree-month periods ended Six-month periods ended\nSeptember 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023\nCustomer G 13% 16% 14% 13%\nTop five largest customers 39% 46% 39% 38%\nOur trade accounts receivables and contract assets are from companies within the solar industry and, as such, we are exposed to normal industry credit risks.\nWe periodically evaluate our reserves for potential credit losses and establish reserves for such losses.\nThe following table sets forth the total accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses and contract assets, from our largest customers that exceeded 10%\nof such total, and the total accounts receivable and contract assets, net of allowance for credit losses, from our top five customers by percentage during the\nperiods included below:\nAs of September 27, 2024 As of March 31, 2024\nCustomer A 9% 12%\nCustomer G 14% 16%\nTop five largest customers 42% 47%\nCommodity price risk\nWe are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, such as steel, that are used in our products. Prices of these raw\nmaterials may be affected by supply restrictions or other market factors from time to time, and we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate\ncommodity risk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could\n30\nreduce our operating margins if we are unable to recover such increases from our customers, and could harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIn addition, we are subject to risk from fluctuating logistics costs. As a result of disruptions caused by geopolitical conflicts, consumer and commercial demand\nfor shipped goods has increased across multiple industries, which in turn has reduced the availability and capacity of shipping containers and available ships\nworldwide. These disruptions caused, and may in the future cause, increased logistics costs and shipment delays affecting the timing of our project deliveries,\nthe timing of our recognition of revenue and our profitability.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nWe transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have established a\nforeign currency risk management policy to manage this risk. We intend to manage our foreign currency exposure by evaluating and using non-financial\ntechniques, such as currency of invoice, leading and lagging payments and receivables management.\nBased on our overall currency rate exposures as of September 27, 2024 and March 31, 2024, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge\nthe nonfunctional currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and cash flows, and other factors, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar\nfrom its cross-functional rates would not be expected, in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows\nin the near-term.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\na. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there\ncan be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of September 27, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such\ndate, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nb. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred\nduring the quarter ended September 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n31\nc. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However,\nour management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and\nall fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of\ntwo or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over\ntime, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of\nthe inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn the ordinary course of conducting our business, we have in the past and may in the future become involved in various legal actions and other claims. We\nmay also become involved in other judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses.\nSome of these matters may involve claims of substantial amounts. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement\nclaims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. These legal proceedings may be subject to many uncertainties and there can be no\nassurance of the outcome of any individual proceedings. We do not believe that these matters, and we are not a party to any other legal proceedings that we\nbelieve, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFor more information, see Note 8 “Commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated final statements included elsewhere\nin this Quarterly Report.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business and our ability to execute our strategy are subject to many risks. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nSummary of Risk Factors\n• The demand for solar energy and, in turn, our products is impacted by many factors outside of our control, and if such demand does not continue to\ngrow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate, our business and prospects will suffer.\n• Competitive pressures within our industry may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n• We face competition from conventional and other renewable energy sources that may offer products and solutions that are less expensive or otherwise\nperceived to be more advantageous than solar energy solutions.\n• Delays in construction projects and any failure to manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on us.\n• Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our\nresults of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations.\n• The reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable energy and solar energy\nspecifically could reduce demand for solar energy systems and harm our business.\n32\n• International regulation of and incentives for solar projects vary by jurisdiction and may change or be eliminated.\n• Our failure to maintain appropriate environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and investor confidence, and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n• We rely heavily on our suppliers and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our suppliers or if there are disruptions in our\nsupply chain.\n• Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• Our business and industry, including our customers and suppliers, are subject to risks of severe weather events, natural disasters, climate change and\nother catastrophic events.\n• Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our\nproducts and services.\n• Changes in the global trade environment, including the imposition of import tariffs, could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues,\nresults of operations or cash flows.\n• We may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue.\n• A further increase in interest rates, or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt financing, could make it difficult for project\ndevelopers and owners to finance the cost of a solar energy system and could reduce the demand for our products.\n• A loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment, could harm our business\nand negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\n• Defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers, reputational damage and decreased revenue, and we may face\nwarranty, indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products.\n• We may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our product development operations.\n• Our continued expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business, financial, regulatory and competitive risks.\n• Electric utility industry policies and regulations may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy\nsystems that could significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete.\n• A drop in the price of electricity sold may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• Technological advances in the solar components industry could render our systems uncompetitive or obsolete.\n• If we fail to, or incur significant costs in order to, obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property, our business and results of\noperations could be materially harmed.\n• Cybersecurity or other data security incidents could harm our business, expose us to liability and cause reputational damage.\n• We are required to pay others for certain tax benefits that we are deemed to realize under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the amounts we may pay\ncould be significant.\n• Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Risks that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider material could\nalso have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these or the following risks occur, the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Some statements in this Quarterly Report, including statements in\nthe following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See the section entitled “Special note regarding forward-looking statements.”\n33\nRisks related to our business and our industry\nThe demand for solar energy and, in turn, our products is impacted by many factors outside of our control, and if such demand does not continue to grow\nor grows at a slower rate than we anticipate, our business and prospects will suffer.\nOur future success depends on continued demand for utility-scale solar energy. Solar energy is a rapidly evolving and competitive market that has experienced\nsubstantial changes in recent years, and we cannot be certain that EPCs, developers, owners and operators of solar projects will remain active in the market or\nthat new potential customers will pursue solar energy as an energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business. The demand for solar energy, and in turn,\nour products, may be affected by many factors outside of our control, including:\n• availability, scale and scope of government subsidies, government and tax incentives and financing sources to support the development and\ncommercialization of solar energy solutions;\n• levels of investment by project developers and owners of solar energy products, which tend to decrease when economic growth slows;\n• the emergence, continuance or success of, or increased government support for, other alternative energy generation technologies and products;\n• local, state and federal permitting and other regulatory requirements related to environmental, land use and transmission issues, each of which can\nsignificantly impact the feasibility and timelines for solar projects;\n• technical and regulatory limitations regarding the interconnection of solar energy systems to the electrical grid;\n• the cost and availability of raw materials and components necessary to produce solar energy, such as steel, polysilicon and semiconductor chips; and\n• regional, national or global macroeconomic trends, including increased interest rates or a reduction in the availability of project debt financing, which\ncould affect the demand for new energy resources and customers’ abilities to finance new projects.\nIf demand for solar energy fails to continue to grow, demand for our products will plateau or decrease, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to\nincrease our revenue and grow our business. If we are not able to mitigate these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetitive pressures within our industry may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face intense competition from a large number of solar tracker companies in nearly all of the markets in which we compete. The solar tracker industry is\ncurrently fragmented. This may result in price competition which could adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nSome of our competitors are developing or are currently manufacturing products based on different solar power technologies that may ultimately have costs\nsimilar to or lower than our projected costs. In addition, some of our competitors have or may in the future have lower costs of goods sold, lower operating\ncosts, greater name and brand recognition in specific markets in which we compete or intend to sell our products, greater market shares, access to larger\ncustomer bases, greater resources and significantly greater economies of scale than we do. Additionally, new competitors may enter our market as a result of,\namong other factors, lower research and development costs.\nWe may also face adverse competitive effects from other participants in the solar industry. For example, the price for solar panels has experienced significant\ndeclines in several markets globally in recent periods. Substantial pricing declines for panels can make the returns on investment for tracker technology less\ncompetitive in comparison to fixed tilt racking systems. In addition, other risks include EPCs subjecting their subcontractors who compete for their business,\nsuch as us, to contractual clauses that carry higher contractual risk to us, such as “pay if paid” clauses that requires an EPC to pay us only when the EPC’s end\ncustomer pays the EPC, higher liquidated damages amounts, increased contractual liabilities above 100% of the contract value and more limited force majeure\nclauses, among others.\nIn addition, part of our strategy is to continue to grow our revenues from international markets. Any new geographic market could have different characteristics\nfrom the markets in which we currently sell products, and our ability to compete in such\n34\nmarkets will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences. We may also face competition from lower cost providers in any new markets we enter,\nwhich could decrease the demand for our products or cause us to reduce the cost of our products in order to remain competitive. Any of these factors could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from conventional and other renewable energy sources that may offer products and solutions that are less expensive or otherwise\nperceived to be more advantageous than solar energy solutions.\nWe face significant competition from providers of conventional and renewable energy alternatives such as coal, nuclear, natural gas and wind. We compete\nwith conventional energy sources primarily based on price, predictability of price and energy availability, environmental considerations and the ease with\nwhich customers can use electricity generated by solar energy projects. If solar energy systems cannot offer a compelling value to customers based on these\nfactors, then our business growth may be impaired.\nConventional energy sources generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than solar energy sources, and as a result\nmay be able to devote more resources to research, development, promotion and product sales or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and\nchanges in market conditions than solar energy systems. Conventional and other renewable energy sources may be better suited than solar for certain locations\nor customer requirements and may also offer other value-added products or services that could help them compete with solar energy sources. In addition, the\nsource of a majority of conventional energy electricity is non-renewable, which may in certain markets allow them to sell electricity more cheaply than\nelectricity generated by solar generation facilities. Non-renewable generation is typically available for dispatch at any time, as it is not dependent on the\navailability of intermittent resources such as sunlight. The cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of solar energy products and services, compared to\nconventional and other renewable energy sources, could materially and adversely affect the demand for our products and services, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in construction projects and any failure to manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMany of our products are used in large-scale projects, which generally require a significant amount of planning and preparation and which can be delayed and\nrescheduled for a number of reasons, including customer or partner labor availability, difficulties in complying with environmental and other government\nregulations or obtaining permits, interconnection delays, financing issues, changes in project priorities, additional time required to acquire rights-of-way or\nproperty rights, unanticipated soil conditions, or health-related shutdowns or other work stoppages. These delays may result in unplanned downtime, increased\ncosts and inefficiencies in our operations, and increased levels of excess inventory.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results\nof operations for a particular period to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Because we recognize revenue on projects as legal title\nto equipment is transferred from us to the customer, any delays in large projects from one quarter to another may cause our results of operations for a particular\nperiod to fall below expectations. We have experienced seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the past as a result of fluctuations in our customers’ businesses,\nchanges in local and global market trends, as well as seasonal weather-related disruptions. For example, our customers’ ability to install solar energy systems is\naffected by weather, such as during the winter months. Inclement weather may also affect our logistics and operations by causing delays in the shipping and\ndelivery of our materials, components and products which may, in turn, cause delays in our customers’ solar projects.\nFurther, given that we operate in a rapidly growing industry, the true extent of these fluctuations may have been masked by our recent growth rates and\nconsequently may not be readily apparent from our historical results of operations and may be difficult to predict. Our financial performance, sales, working\ncapital requirements and cash flows may fluctuate, and our past quarterly results of operations may not be good indicators of future performance or prospects.\nAny substantial fluctuation in revenues could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price for any given\nperiod. In addition, revenue and other operating results in future fiscal quarters may fall short of the expectations of investors and financial analysts, which\ncould have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\n35\nThe reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable energy and solar energy specifically\ncould reduce demand for solar energy systems and harm our business.\nFederal, state, local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote\nsolar electricity in the form of tax credits, rebates, subsidies and other financial incentives. The range and duration of these incentives varies widely by\njurisdiction. Our customers typically use our systems for grid-connected applications wherein solar power is sold under a power purchase agreement or into an\norganized electric market. This segment of the solar industry has historically depended in large part on the availability and size of government incentives\nsupporting the use of renewable energy. Consequently, the reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for grid-connected solar electricity\nmay negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and non-solar renewable sources of electricity, and could harm or halt the\ngrowth of the solar electricity industry and our business. These reductions, eliminations or expirations could occur without warning. Any changes to the\nexisting framework of these incentives could cause fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe IRA made significant changes to the federal income tax credits available to solar energy projects, including the investment tax credit (“ITC”) under Section\n48 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”) for certain energy property. Guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the availability of ITC\nhas changed in the past and is subject to change in the future. Investments in certain solar projects may qualify for a domestic content bonus credit amount if\nthe solar energy project satisfies certain “domestic content” requirements.\nOn May 12, 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released Notice 2023-38 providing guidance with respect to the IRA’s domestic content bonus\ncredit. In Notice 2023-38, the Treasury Department and the IRS announced their intent to propose regulations in the future that will apply to taxable years\nending after May 12, 2023, and provided that in the interim, taxpayers may rely on the rules described in Notice 2023-38 for the domestic content bonus credit\nrequirements for any qualified solar energy project the construction of which begins before the date that is 90 days after the date of publication of the\nforthcoming proposed regulations in the Federal Register.\nOn June 21, 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued notices of proposed rulemaking and public hearing and temporary regulations providing\ninitial guidance on the elective payment of applicable credits under Section 6417 of the IRC and the transfer of certain credits under Section 6418 of the IRC.\nThe proposed Treasury regulations were subsequently finalized. The Section 6417 Treasury regulations are effective as of May 10, 2024, while the Section\n6418 Treasury regulations became effective on July 1, 2024.\nOn December 15, 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and public hearing providing initial guidance on the\nadvanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X of the IRC, established by the IRA (the “Section 45X Credit”) which is a per-unit tax credit that\nis earned over time for each clean energy component domestically produced and sold by a manufacturer.\nOn May 16, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released Notice 2024-41 providing additional guidance with respect to the IRA’s domestic content\nbonus credit, which provides a new elective safe harbor that taxpayers may elect to use to classify applicable project components and calculate the domestic\ncost percentage in an applicable project to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit amounts.\nGenerally, a qualified facility or energy project seeking a domestic content bonus credit must satisfy certain U.S. domestic sourcing or production requirements\nfor iron, steel and manufactured products. In addition, the United States taxpayer reporting a domestic content bonus credit must satisfy certain certification,\nrecordkeeping and substantiation requirements.\nIn lieu of the ITC, as a result of changes made by the IRA, United States taxpayers may also be allowed to elect to receive a production tax credit (“PTC”)\nunder Section 45 of the IRC for qualified solar facilities if the construction begins before January 1, 2025 and the facility is placed in service for federal income\ntax purposes after 2021.\nThe PTC is available for electricity produced by a qualifying solar project and sold to unrelated persons during the ten years following the qualifying solar\nproject’s placement in service and is equal to an inflation-adjusted amount of 3.00 cents per kilowatt hour during calendar year 2024 (for projects placed in\nservice after 2021), for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by a qualifying solar project and sold to unrelated persons, which inflation-adjusted amount\nis updated annually. The available credit amount is increased by up to 10% if the domestic content requirements described above are satisfied. The amounts of\nany PTCs or ITCs are subject to change by order of the IRS.\n36\nUnder the IRA, for certain qualifying projects placed in service after 2024, each of the ITC and PTC will be replaced by similar “technology neutral” tax credit\nincentives that mimic the ITC and PTC, but also require that projects satisfy a “zero greenhouse gas emissions” standard in order to qualify for the tax credits.\nThis new tax credit regime will continue to apply to projects that begin construction prior to the end of 2033, at which point the credits will become subject to a\nphase-out schedule.\nWhile these changes are intended to encourage investments in new solar projects, the impact these changes will have on our results of operations is unclear. For\nexample, if we are unable to meet the domestic content requirements necessary for customers using our tracker products to qualify for the incremental domestic\ncontent bonus credit and our competitors are able to do so, we might experience a decline in sales for U.S. projects.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has provided certain guidance on the domestic content requirements; however, further clarifications may be forthcoming and it\nis possible customers may impose certain domestic content requirements on us as a result. Such domestic content requirements may increase our production\ncosts. Further, the timing and nature of the U.S. Treasury Department’s eventual proposed and final implementing regulations, which are expected to supersede\nNotice 2023-38 and Notice 2024-41, remain uncertain. When final implementing regulations for domestic content requirements are released, we may not have\nan adequate supply of tracker products satisfying the domestic content requirements to meet customer demand. In addition, compliance with domestic content\nrequirements may significantly increase our record-keeping, accounting and production costs. As a result of these risks, the domestic content requirements may\nhave a material adverse impact on our U.S. sales, business and results of operations.\nIf our customers are unable to satisfy their respective prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements under the IRA, for projects that establish the beginning\nof construction on or after January 29, 2023, the tax credits available to the customers will be lower than the credits available prior to the IRA. If a significant\nportion of our customers are unable to satisfy prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements under the IRA, demand for our tracker products may be\nadversely impacted by the reduced tax credits available to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOn October 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS published final Treasury regulations (the “45X Treasury regulations”) regarding the Section\n45X Credit, which become effective on December 27, 2024. The 45X Treasury regulations retain the same basic structure as the proposed Treasury regulations\nissued on December 15, 2023 with certain revisions. In particular, the 45X Treasury regulations confirm a solar tracker is not a solar energy component that is\nan eligible component under Section 45X of the IRC, but torque tubes and structural fasteners may qualify as eligible components. While we believe that\ncertain of our products, namely our torque tubes and a portion of our structural fasteners, should qualify under Section 45X, our ability to ultimately benefit\nfrom Section 45X and other IRA tax credits is not guaranteed.\nCertain provisions of the IRA have been the subject of substantial public interest and have been subject to debate, and there are divergent views on potential\nimplementation, guidance, rules and regulatory principles by a diverse group of interested parties. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will\nfully qualify for the benefits under the IRA or that competitors will not disproportionately benefit or gain competitive advantages as a result of the IRA’s\nimplementation or interpretation. In addition, if our customers or suppliers incorrectly interpret the requirements of the IRA’s tax credits and it is later\ndetermined that the tax credits were incorrectly claimed, we may be penalized.\nAs a result, the final interpretation and implementation of the provisions in the IRA could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Furthermore, future\nlegislative enactments or administrative actions could limit, amend, repeal or terminate IRA policies or other incentives that the Company currently hopes to\nleverage. Any reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application or expiration of the IRA may materially adversely affect the Company’s future operating\nresults and liquidity.\nChanges to tax laws and regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects, including our ability to optimize those changes brought about by the passage of the IRA.\nIn addition, federal, state, local and foreign government bodies have implemented additional policies that are intended to promote or mandate renewable\nelectricity generally or solar electricity in particular. For example, many U.S. states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production\nand/or a renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the\nstate from eligible renewable energy sources, including utility-scale solar power generation facilities, by a specified date. While the recent trend has been for\njurisdictions with RPSs to maintain or expand them, there have been certain exceptions and there can be no assurances that RPSs or other policies supporting\nrenewable energy will continue. Proposals to extend compliance deadlines,\n37\nreduce renewable requirements or solar set-asides, or entirely repeal RPSs emerge from time to time in various jurisdictions. Reduction or elimination of RPSs,\nas well as changes to other renewable-energy and solar-energy policies, could reduce the potential growth of the solar energy industry and materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nMoreover, changes in policies of recent U.S. presidential administrations have created regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry, including the\nsolar energy industry, and have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business. For example, in the span of less than six years, the United\nStates joined, withdrew from, and then rejoined the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation following changes in administration between U.S.\nPresidents Obama, Trump and Biden. The change in administration following the 2024 U.S. presidential election could further impact policies relating to\nrenewable energy. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on June 30, 2022 in West Virginia v. EPA, holding that the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (“EPA”) exceeded its authority in enacting a subsequently repealed rule that would have allowed electric utility generation facility owners to reduce\nemissions with “outside the fence measures” may limit EPA’s ability to address greenhouse gas emissions comprehensively without specific authorization from\nCongress.\nInternational regulation of and incentives for solar projects vary by jurisdiction and may change or be eliminated.\nThe international markets in which we operate or may operate in the future may have or may put in place policies to promote renewable energy, including solar.\nThese incentives and mechanisms vary from country to country. In seeking to achieve growth internationally, we may make investments that, to some extent,\nrely on governmental incentives and support in a new market.\nThere is no assurance that these governments will provide or continue to provide sufficient incentives and support to the solar industry or that the industry in\nany particular country will not suffer significant downturns in the future as the result of changes in public policies or government interest in renewable energy,\nany of which would adversely affect demand for our solar products.\nOur failure to maintain appropriate environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and investor confidence, and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nGovernments, customers, investors, and employees are enhancing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly\nevolving and increasing. Failure to adequately maintain appropriate ESG practices that meet diverse stakeholder expectations may result in an inability to\nattract customers, the loss of business, diluted market valuation, and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, standards, processes and\ngovernmental requirements for disclosing sustainability metrics may change over time, resulting in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to\nour sustainability commitments or our ability to achieve them. As governments impose greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements and other ESG-related\nlaws, we are subject to at least some of these rules and concomitant regulatory risk exposure. ESG compliance and reporting could be costly, and we could be\nat a disadvantage compared to companies that do not have similar reporting requirements.\nFor example, recently published rules by the SEC could require significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in our periodic reporting, which may require\nus to incur significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls regarding matters that have not been\nsubject to such controls in the past. In addition, California recently enacted climate disclosure laws that may require companies to report on greenhouse gas\nemissions, climate-related financial risks, and the use of carbon offsets and emissions reduction claims. Similarly, we may be subject to the requirements of the\nEU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (and its implementing laws and regulations) and other EU and EU member state regulations, or disclosure\nrequirements on various sustainability topics. These requirements vary across jurisdictions, which may result in increased complexity and cost, for compliance.\nFurthermore, industry and market practices continue to evolve, and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and\nstay competitive among our peers, which could result in higher associated compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations.\nWe rely heavily on our suppliers and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with our suppliers or if there are disruptions in our supply\nchain.\nWe purchase our components through arrangements with various suppliers located across the globe. We depend on our suppliers to source materials and\nmanufacture critical components for our products. Our reliance on these suppliers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control\nover component availability, delivery schedules and costs which\n38\ncould disrupt our ability to procure these components in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Any shortages of components or raw materials for these products\ncould affect our ability to timely deliver our products to our customers, which may result in liquidated damages or contractual disputes with our customers,\nharm our reputation and lead to a decrease in demand for our products.\nFor example, our products are manufactured from steel and, as a result, our business is significantly affected by the price of steel. When steel prices are higher,\nthe prices that we charge customers for our products may increase, which may decrease demand for our products. Conversely, if steel prices decline, customers\nmay demand lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices or lower sales volume and, consequently,\nnegatively affect our profitability. A significant portion of the steel used to produce our products is derived directly or indirectly from steel mills located in\nChina. At times, pricing and availability of steel can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including domestic and international economic\nconditions, global steel capacity, import levels, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials necessary to produce steel, sales levels, competition, consolidation of\nsteel producers, labor costs, transportation costs, import duties and tariffs and foreign currency exchange rates. The volatility in the availability and cost of steel\nmay impact our business.\nFurther, if any of our suppliers were unable or unwilling to manufacture the components that we require for our products in sufficient volumes or at sufficiently\nhigh quality levels or to renew existing terms under supply agreements, we would need to identify, qualify and select acceptable alternative suppliers. An\nalternative supplier may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially\nreasonable terms, including price. Any significant disruption to our ability to procure our components, and our suppliers’ ability to procure materials to\nmanufacture components for our products could increase the production cost of our products or reduce or delay our ability to perform under our contracts and\ncould thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as noted above, the IRA provides incremental tax credits for U.S. solar projects satisfying domestic content requirements. While the impact of these\nrequirements on us remains fluid and uncertain pending customer response and any future or final implementing regulations, if we are unable to provide our\ntracker products in a manner that satisfies applicable domestic content requirements, we might experience a decline in sales for U.S. projects, especially if our\ncompetitors are able to satisfy such domestic content requirements. In addition, compliance with these requirements may increase our production costs. In light\nof the foregoing, our U.S. sales, profitability and results of operations in the United States may be adversely affected by applicable domestic content\nrequirements which must be satisfied in order for solar projects to be eligible for these incremental credits.\nFurther, disruption in our supply chain and transportation channels, including changes by carriers and transportation companies relating to delivery schedules,\nshortages in available cargo capacity or labor availability, payment terms and frequency of service and pricing as well as cargo ship, shipping channel\ndisruptions or work stoppages or strikes could impact our ability to timely deliver our products to our customers or increase delivery costs. For example, many\nshipping companies have paused shipments through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea as a result of attacks against commercial vessels in the area, causing\nrerouting of commercial vessels. As a result, we may experience increased costs and delivery delays.\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMacroeconomic developments, such as the global or regional economic effects resulting from the current Russia-Ukraine conflict and current Middle East\ninstability, including the Israel-Hamas conflict (including the disruption of transporting goods through the Suez Canal), further increases in inflation and related\neconomic curtailment initiatives, evolving trade policies or the occurrence of similar events that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or\nmarket conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Local political issues and conflicts could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if they affect geographies in which we do business or obtain our components.\nA local conflict, such as the Ukraine-Russian War or the Middle East conflict, could also have a significant adverse impact on regional or global\nmacroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability or result in heightened economic tariffs, sanctions and import-export restrictions in a manner that\nadversely affects us, including to the extent that any such actions cause material business interruptions or restrict our ability to conduct business with certain\nsuppliers. Additionally, such conflict or sanctions may significantly devalue various global currencies and have a negative impact on economies in geographies\nin which we do business. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the impact or anticipated impact of the upcoming\npresidential election in the United States.\n39\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, labor shortages, ongoing or increasing inflation, tighter credit,\nhigher interest rates and currency fluctuations, may cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their budgets and spending, which could cause\ncustomers to delay, decrease or cancel projects with us.\nOur business and industry, including our customers and suppliers, are subject to risks of severe weather events, natural disasters, climate change and other\ncatastrophic events.\nOur headquarters and testing facilities, which conduct functional and reliability testing for our components and products, are located in the Bay Area of\nNorthern California and our solar projects are located in the U.S. and around the world. A severe weather event or other catastrophe impacting our headquarters\nor testing facilities could cause significant damage and disruption to our business operations. In addition, a severe weather event or other catastrophe could\nsignificantly impact our supply chain by causing delays in the shipping and delivery of our materials, components and products which may, in turn, cause\ndelays in our customers’ solar projects. Our customers’ ability to install solar energy systems is also affected by weather events, such as during the winter\nmonths, and other catastrophic events.\nIn addition, our operations and facilities and those of the third parties on which we rely are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, cybersecurity attacks and other data security incidents, labor\ndisputes, including labor shortages, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond our and their control.\nAny damage and disruption in any locations in which we have offices or in which our customers or suppliers operate, which are caused by severe weather\nevents (such as extreme cold weather, hail, hurricanes, tornadoes and heavy snowfall), seismic activity, fires, floods and other natural disasters or catastrophic\nevents could result in a delay or even a complete cessation of our worldwide or regional operations and could cause severe damage to our products and\nequipment used in our solar projects. Global climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of certain types of severe weather events. Even if our\ntracker products are not damaged, severe weather, natural disasters and catastrophic events may cause damage to the solar panels that are mounted to our\ntracker products, which could result in decreased demand for our products, loss of customers and the withdrawal of coverage for solar panels and solar tracking\nsystems by insurance companies. Any of these events would negatively impact our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers and could result\nin reduced demand for our products and services, and any damage to our products and equipment used for our solar projects could result in large warranty\nclaims which could, individually or in the aggregate, exceed the amount of insurance available to us, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our\nproducts and services.\nChanges in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could materially\naffect the sales and use of our products and services. In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export and import control requirements may impact our\nability to sell and support our products and services in certain jurisdictions. If we were to fail to comply with export controls laws and regulations, U.S.\neconomic sanctions or other similar laws, including restrictions from the international community, or conflict mineral regulations, we could be subject to both\ncivil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration for employees and managers for willful violations and the possible loss of our\nexport or import privileges.\nObtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or transaction may not be possible and may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss\nof sales opportunities. Further, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions in many cases prohibit the export of services to certain U.S. embargoed or\nsanctioned countries, governments and persons, as well as for prohibited end-uses. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we comply with all relevant\nexport control laws and regulations, including restrictions from the international community, any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have\nnegative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.\nChanges in the global trade environment, including the imposition of import tariffs, could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of\noperations or cash flows.\nEscalating trade tensions, particularly between the United States and China, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to\ncertain materials and components for our products such as steel, or for products used in solar energy projects more broadly, such as solar modules and solar\ncells.\n40\nMore specifically, the United States has imposed tariffs and quotas on steel imports as well as tariffs on imported solar modules and cells. We use international\nsuppliers of steel and the steel tariffs could result in interruptions in the supply chain and impact our costs and our gross margins. There currently is a safeguard\ntariff on most imported solar modules pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. The Section 201 tariff on solar modules is set at 14.25% until February\n6, 2025, at which point it will drop to 14% until February 6, 2026. The prior Section 201 tariff exemption for bifacial panels has been revoked, subjecting\nbifacial panels to the Section 201 tariff.\nThere also are tariffs on various solar equipment, including solar cells and modules, inverters and power optimizers, imported from China under Section 301 of\nthe Trade Act of 1974, and antidumping and countervailing duty (“AD/CVD”) duties on imported solar cells and modules.\nEffective September 27, 2024, Section 301 tariffs on certain Chinese steel products increased to 25%, Section 301 tariffs on Chinese solar cells and modules\nincreased to 50%, and Section 301 tariffs on parts of lead-acid storage batteries (including separators thereof) increased to 25%. Effective January 1, 2026,\nSection 301 tariffs on Chinese lithium-ion non-EV batteries are scheduled to increase to 25%.\nOur products contain steel and certain Section 301 steel tariffs are applicable to us. Additionally, while the Section 201 and Section 301 tariffs on solar modules\nand/or cells are not directly applicable to our products, they may indirectly affect us by increasing the costs of components of solar energy projects, thereby\nadversely impacting the financial viability of solar energy projects in which our products are used, which could lead to decreased demand for our products.\nFollowing the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, trade policies affecting materials and components for our products such as steel or for products used\nin solar energy projects more broadly, such as solar modules and lithium-ion batteries, are subject to change. The Biden Administration previously announced\nthat the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) will closely monitor solar module import patterns to ensure the U.S. market\ndoes not become oversaturated and will explore all available measures to take action against unfair practices. Consequently, U.S. trade policies continue to be\nin flux, and trade policies implemented by the Biden Administration or subsequent administrations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOn August 18, 2023, Commerce issued a final affirmative determination of circumvention with respect to certain crystalline solar photovoltaic (“CSPV”) cells\nand modules produced in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam using parts and components from China. As a result, CSPV cells and modules covered by\nthe circumvention determination are now subject to AD/CVD orders on CSPV cells and modules from China that have been in place since 2012. Imports of\nCSPV cells and modules from the four Southeast Asian countries covered by the circumvention determination that entered the United States prior to June 6,\n2024 are not subject to AD/CVD cash deposit requirements provided the cells or modules are utilized (i.e., withdrawn from a warehouse and affixed to a\nstructure or system in the United States) prior to December 3, 2024. Imports of CSPV cells and modules from the four Southeast Asian countries covered by\nthe circumvention determination that entered the United States on or after June 6, 2024 are subject to AD/CVD cash deposit requirements and, ultimately, to\nAD/CVD duties. Cash deposit rates for CSPV modules covered by the China AD/CVD orders vary significantly depending on the producer and exporter of the\nmodules and may amount to over 250% of the entered value of the imported merchandise.\nAdditionally, on May 14, 2024, Commerce initiated AD and CVD investigations covering CSPV cells and modules produced in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand\nand Vietnam that are not covered by the circumvention proceeding finalized in August 2023. On October 1, 2024, Commerce publicly issued affirmative\npreliminary countervailing duty determinations in the new CVD investigations and imposed cash deposit requirements ranging from 0% to 293% on CSPV\ncells and modules imported from the four Southeast Asian countries and covered by the new investigations. Commerce is expected to issue its preliminary\ndeterminations in the parallel AD cases in late November 2024.\nAD/CVD cash deposits and duties collected on imports of CSPV cells and modules could adversely impact our business by adversely impacting the projects\nincorporating our products. Such impacts are largely out of our control and may include the timing and economics of customer project delays or cancellations.\nImports of solar modules produced in China or incorporating cells or other materials produced in whole or in part in China may be detained at the U.S. border\nby U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (Public Law No. 117-78). To the extent that such detentions\noccur, solar modules may not reach project sites, which may result in significant delays in the development and entry into operation of solar energy projects.\n41\nThe ultimate severity or duration of the expected solar panel supply chain disruption or its effects on our clients’ solar project development and construction\nactivities, and associated consequences on our business, is uncertain. More broadly, recent revisions to U.S. regulations governing AD/CVD proceedings may\nmake it easier for domestic companies to obtain affirmative determinations in such proceedings, which could result in future successful petitions and\nadministrative decisions that limit imports from Asia and other regions.\nExisting tariffs and duties, the possibility of additional or increased tariffs or duties in the future, and the detention by CBP of solar modules all have created\nuncertainty in the solar industry. If the price of solar systems increases, the use of solar systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our\ngross margins or reduce the demand for solar systems, which in turn may decrease demand for our products.\nAdditionally, existing or future tariffs and CBP detentions of solar modules may negatively affect key customers and suppliers, and other supply chain partners.\nSuch outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows, and continuing uncertainty could cause sales\nvolatility, price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products. It is difficult to predict what further\ntrade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and\neffectively react to such actions. While we have taken actions with the intention of, among other things, mitigating the effect of steel tariffs on our business by\nreducing our reliance on China-origin steel, we may not be able to do so broadly or on attractive terms.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue.\nBacklog can be subject to large variations from quarter to quarter and comparisons of backlog from period to period are not necessarily indicative of future\nrevenue. The contracts comprising our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period or at all, and the actual revenue from such contracts\nmay differ from our backlog estimates. The timing of receipt of revenue, if any, on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the\nscheduling of projects. Cancellation of or adjustments to contracts may occur.\nThe failure to realize all amounts in our backlog could adversely affect our future revenue and gross margins. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date\nmay not be an accurate indicator of our future financial performance.\nA further increase in interest rates, or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt financing, could make it difficult for project developers\nand owners to finance the cost of a solar energy system and could reduce the demand for our products.\nMany solar project owners depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to construct a solar energy project. As a result, a further increase\nin interest rates, or a reduction in the supply of project debt or tax equity financing, could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or\notherwise make it difficult for project owners to secure the financing necessary to construct a solar energy project on favorable terms, or at all, and thus lower\ndemand for our products which could limit our growth or reduce our sales. In addition, we believe that a significant percentage of project owners construct\nsolar energy projects as an investment, funding a significant portion of the initial capital expenditure with financing from third parties. A further increase in\ninterest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment on a solar energy project, increase equity requirements or make alternative investments more\nattractive relative to solar energy projects, and, in each case, could cause these project owners to seek alternative investments.\nA loss of one or more of our significant customers, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment, could harm our business\nand negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, our largest customer constituted 17% of our total revenues. The loss of any one of our significant customers, their inability\nto perform under their contracts, or their default in payment, could have a substantial effect on our revenues and profits. Further, our trade accounts receivable\nand unbilled receivable (“contract assets”) are from companies within the solar industry, and, as such, we are exposed to normal industry credit risks. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, our largest customer constituted 15.5% of our total trade accounts receivable and contract assets balances. Accordingly, loss of a significant\ncustomer or a significant reduction in pricing or order volume from a significant customer could substantially reduce our revenue and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n42\nDefects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers, reputational damage and decreased revenue, and we may face\nwarranty, indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products.\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new generations are released. Errors, defects or poor\nperformance can arise due to design flaws, defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties, which can affect both the quality and the yield\nof the product. Any actual or perceived errors, defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products, shipment\ndelays, rejection of our products, damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and\nincreases in customer service and support costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, defective components may give rise to warranty, indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive\nfrom the affected products. Our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our products under normal use and service conditions. As a\nresult, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold products and recognized revenue. While we have accrued reserves for warranty claims, our\nestimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent the warranty claims profile of future products is not comparable with that of\nearlier generation products under warranty. Our warranty accruals are based on our assumptions and we do not have a long history of making such\nassumptions. As a result, these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems, causing us to incur substantial\nunanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products. Our failure to accurately predict\nfuture claims could result in unexpected volatility in, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage, including as a result of product malfunctions, defects or improper\ninstallation, then we could be exposed to product liability claims. Any such claim could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert management’s\nattention and harm our reputation.\nWe may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our product development operations.\nOur product development and testing processes are complex and require significant technological expertise. Such processes involve a number of precise steps\nfrom design to production. Any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors, requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our suppliers’\nproduction lines until the errors can be researched, identified, and properly addressed and rectified. This may occur particularly as we introduce new products,\nmodify our engineering techniques and/or expand our capacity. The commercialization of any new products may also fail to achieve market adoption or may\nexperience downward pricing pressure, which would have a material impact on our gross margins and results of operations. Further, the installation of our\nproducts involves various risks and complications which may increase as our products evolve and develop, and any such increase in risks and complications\nmay have a negative effect on our gross margins. In addition, our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product\nfailures, loss of customers, increased warranty reserve, increased production and logistics costs, and delays. Any of these developments could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur continued expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business, financial, regulatory and competitive risks.\nPart of our strategy is to continue to grow our revenues from international markets, including entering new geographic markets to expand our current\ninternational presence. Our products and services to be offered in these regions may differ from our current products and services in several ways, such as the\nconsumption and utilization of local raw materials, components and logistics, the re-engineering of select components to meet region-specific requirements and\nregion-specific customer training, site commissioning, warranty remediation and other technical services. Any of these differences or required changes to our\nproducts and services to meet the requirements of local laws and regulations may increase the cost of our products, reduce demand and result in a decrease in\nour gross margins. We may also face competition from lower cost providers in any new markets we enter which could decrease the demand for our products or\ncause us to reduce the cost of our products in order to remain competitive.\nAny new geographic market could have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products, and our success in such markets will\ndepend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences. These differences may include differing regulatory requirements, including local manufacturing\ncontent requirements, tax laws, trade laws, labor regulations, corporate formation laws and requirements, tariffs, export quotas, customs duties or other trade\nrestrictions, limited or\n43\nunfavorable intellectual property protection, international political or economic conditions, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, longer sales cycles,\nwarranty expectations, product return policies and cost, performance and compatibility requirements. In addition, expanding into new geographic markets will\nincrease our exposure to presently existing risks, such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying\nwith U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), as well as\nrelevant anti-money laundering laws.\nFailure to develop new products successfully or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our continued expansion into new geographic\nmarkets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nElectric utility industry policies and regulations may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems\nthat could significantly reduce demand for our products or harm our ability to compete.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign government policies and regulations concerning the broader electric utility industry, as well as internal policies and regulations\npromulgated by electric utilities and organized electric markets with respect to fees, practices and rate design, heavily influence the market for electricity\ngeneration products and services. These policies and regulations often affect electricity pricing and the interconnection of generation facilities and can be\nsubject to frequent modifications by governments, regulatory bodies, utilities and market operators. For example, changes in fee structures, electricity pricing\nstructures and system permitting, regional market rules, interconnection and operating requirements can deter purchases of renewable energy products,\nincluding solar energy systems, by reducing anticipated revenues or increasing costs or regulatory burdens for would-be system purchasers. The resulting\nreductions in demand for solar energy systems could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant development in renewable-energy pricing policies in the United States occurred when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)\nissued a final rule amending regulations that implement the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (“PURPA”) on July 16, 2020, which FERC upheld on\nrehearing on November 19, 2020. Among other requirements, PURPA mandates that electric utilities buy the output of certain renewable generators, including\nqualifying solar energy facilities, below established capacity thresholds. PURPA also requires that such sales occur at a utility’s “avoided cost” rate. FERC’s\nPURPA reforms include modifications (1) to how regulators and electric utilities may establish avoided cost rates for new contracts, (2) that reduce from 20\nMW to 5 MW the capacity threshold above which a renewable-energy qualifying facility is rebuttably presumed to have non-discriminatory market access,\nthereby removing the requirement for utilities to purchase its output, (3) that require regulators to establish criteria for determining when an electric utility\nincurs a legally enforceable obligation to purchase from a PURPA facility and (4) that reduce barriers for third parties to challenge PURPA eligibility. These\nnew regulations took effect on February 16, 2021, but the net effect of these changes is uncertain, as they have only been effective for a short time, and some\nchanges will not become fully effective until states and other jurisdictions implement the new authorities provided by FERC. In general, however, FERC’s\nPURPA reforms have the potential to reduce prices for the output from certain new renewable generation projects while also narrowing the scope of PURPA\neligibility for new projects. These effects could reduce opportunities and demand for PURPA-eligible solar energy systems, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFERC is also taking steps to encourage the integration of new forms of generation into the electric grid and remove barriers to grid access, which could have\npositive impacts on the solar energy industry. For example, on July 28, 2023 FERC issued a final rule, designated as Order No. 2023, to reform procedures and\nagreements that electric transmission providers use to integrate new generating facilities into the existing transmission system.\nChanges in other federal, state and local current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws, regulations or policies in the jurisdictions in\nwhich we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any changes to government, utility or\nelectric market regulations or policies that favor non-solar generation or other market participants, remove or reduce renewable procurement standards and\ngoals or that make construction or operation of new solar generation facilities more expensive or difficult, could reduce the competitiveness of solar energy\nsystems and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services and adversely impact our growth. Moreover, there may be changes in\nregulations that impact access to supply chains related to cybersecurity threats to the electric grid that could have a disproportionate impact on solar energy\nsystem components. In addition, changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in\ninternational markets, prevent our customers\n44\nfrom deploying our products internationally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any such event could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA drop in the price of electricity sold may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreases in the price of electricity, whether in organized electric markets or with contract counterparties, may negatively impact the owners of the solar\nenergy projects, make the purchase of solar energy systems less economically attractive and would likely lower sales of our products. The price of electricity\ncould decrease as a result of many factors, including but not limited to:\n• construction of a significant number of new, lower-cost power generation plants;\n• relief of transmission constraints that enable distant, lower-cost generation to transmit energy less expensively or in greater quantities;\n• reductions in the price of natural gas or other fuels;\n• utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation;\n• decreased electricity demand, including from energy conservation technologies, public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption or a reduction in\neconomic activity due to a localized or macroeconomic downturn;\n• development of smart-grid technologies that lower the peak energy requirements;\n• development of new or lower-cost customer-sited energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer’s average cost of electricity\nby shifting load to off-peak times; and\n• development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nMoreover, if the cost of electricity generated by solar energy installations incorporating our systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources,\nit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological advances in the solar components industry or developments in alternative technologies could render our systems uncompetitive or obsolete.\nThe solar industry is characterized by its rapid adoption and application of technological advances. Our competitors may develop technologies more advanced\nand cost-effective than ours, or broader solar panel design could change resulting in our products no longer being compatible. Additionally, significant\ndevelopments in alternative technologies, such as advances in other forms of solar tracking systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. We will need to invest substantially in research and development to maintain our market position and effectively\ncompete in the future.\nOur failure to further refine or enhance our technologies, or adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes, could render our technologies uncompetitive or\nobsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our revenues to decline.\nIn addition, we may invest in and implement newly developed, less-proven technologies in our project development or in maintaining or enhancing our existing\nprojects. There is no guarantee that these new technologies will perform or generate customer demand as anticipated. The failure of our new technologies to\nperform as anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to, or incur significant costs in order to, obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property, our business and results of\noperations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade\nsecret and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual\nproperty. Such means may afford only limited protection of our intellectual property and may not (i) prevent our competitors or manufacturing suppliers from\nduplicating our processes or technology; (ii) prevent our competitors or manufacturing suppliers from gaining access to our proprietary information or\ntechnology; or (iii) permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.\n45\nWe generally seek or apply for patent protection as and if we deem appropriate, based on then-current facts and circumstances. We cannot guarantee that any of\nour pending patent applications or other applications for intellectual property registrations will be issued or granted or that our existing or future intellectual\nproperty rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology. Even if we are to obtain issuance of further patents or registration of other\nintellectual property, such intellectual property could be subject to attacks on ownership, validity, enforceability or other legal attacks. Any such impairment or\nother failure to obtain sufficient intellectual property protection could impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position and\nharm our business and operating results, including forcing us to, among other things, rebrand or re-design our affected products.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely heavily on nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary information, know-how, technology and trade secrets.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our proprietary information,\nknow-how, technology and trade secrets, including employees, contractors, third-party manufacturers, other suppliers, customers, other stakeholders involved\nin solar projects, or other business partners or prospective partners. Moreover, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling\naccess to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how, technology and trade secrets. Similarly, while it\nis our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements\nassigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops\nintellectual property that we regard as our own, such agreements may be breached or may not be self-executing, we may not have adequate remedies for any\nsuch breach, and we may be subject to claims that such employees or contractors misappropriated relevant rights from their previous employers.\nIn countries where we have not applied for patent protection or trademark or other intellectual property registration or where effective patent, trademark, trade\nsecret, and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may not be available to the same extent as in the United States, we may be at greater risk that\nour proprietary rights will be circumvented, misappropriated, infringed or otherwise violated.\nWe have initiated, and may in the future need to initiate, infringement claims or litigation in order to try to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights,\nbut such litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our management and other personnel, may provoke third parties to assert\ncounterclaims against us and may not result in favorable outcomes.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more open source licenses could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur products and services use certain software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open source” licenses. Some of these open source\nlicenses may contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works that we create based upon the open source\nsoftware, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties\nrights with respect to such software. In certain circumstances, if we combine our proprietary software with certain open source software, we could be required\nto release the source code for such proprietary software. Additionally, to the extent that we do not comply with the terms of the open source licenses to which\nwe are subject, or such terms are interpreted by a court in a manner different than our own interpretation of such terms, then we may be required to disclose\ncertain of our proprietary software or take other actions that could adversely impact our business. Further, the use of open source software can lead to\nvulnerabilities that may make our software susceptible to attack, and open source licenses generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the\nsoftware. While we attempt to utilize open source software in a manner that helps alleviate these risks, our attempts may not be successful. Any of the\nforegoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n46\nCybersecurity or other data security incidents could harm our business, expose us to liability and cause reputational damage.\nCybersecurity attacks designed to gain access to personal, sensitive or confidential information or disrupt our operations are constantly evolving, and high\nprofile cybersecurity breaches leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, as well as breaches of personal\ninformation, have occurred recently at a number of major U.S. companies, including in the energy, manufacturing and technology sectors. Our or our third-\nparty vendors’ computer systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and other data security incidents, including among other\nthings, malicious intrusion, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, software errors, defects or bugs, acts of vandalism and theft, denial-of-service attacks, social\nengineering attacks, phishing attacks, fraud or malice on the part of our employees, contractors or service providers, human error and other system disruptions\ncaused by unauthorized third parties, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures and other similar incidents, any of which may result in the\nmisappropriation, corruption, unavailability, loss, unauthorized access to or release of personal, sensitive or confidential information or data assets or business\ninterruption.\nWe increasingly rely on commercially available systems, software, sensors, tools (including encryption technology) and monitoring to provide security and\noversight for the transmission, storage, protection and other processing of personal, sensitive and confidential information. Despite advances in security\nhardware, software and encryption technologies, and our own information security program and safeguards, there is no guarantee that our defenses and\ncybersecurity program will be adequate to safeguard against all cybersecurity attacks and other data security incidents. Moreover, because techniques used to\nobtain unauthorized access to personal, sensitive and confidential information or sabotage systems and networks change frequently and generally are not\nidentified until they are launched against a target, we and our suppliers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or\nmitigation measures. We may also experience security breaches and other incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period and therefore may have\na greater impact on our products and the networks and systems used in our business. Such threats and attacks also may see their frequency increased, and\neffectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence.\nWe regularly defend against and respond to data security incidents. We expect to incur significant costs in our efforts to detect and prevent cybersecurity attacks\nand other data security incidents, and we may face increased costs in the event of an actual or perceived cybersecurity attack or other data security incident.\nWhile we generally perform cybersecurity diligence on our key service providers, we do not control our service providers and vendors and our ability to\nmonitor their cybersecurity is limited, so we cannot ensure the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect any information we share with\nthem. We cannot assure you that our vendors or other third-party service providers with access to our or our customers’ or employees’ personal, confidential or\nsensitive information in relation to which we are responsible will not breach contractual obligations imposed by us, or that they will not experience\ncybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, which could have a corresponding effect on our business, including putting us in breach of our privacy\nand data protection obligations.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for cybersecurity liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nA cybersecurity attack or other data security incident in our systems or networks (or in the systems or networks of third parties with which we do business)\ncould result in the unauthorized release of personal information regarding employees or other individuals or other sensitive data, serious disruption of our\noperations, financial losses from containment and remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, including possible punitive damages. As a result of\ncybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations, related\nactions and penalties by regulatory authorities, along with potential costs of notification to impacted individuals. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized\naccess to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with current or future federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and industry standards relating to privacy and data\nprotection could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are or may become subject to a variety of laws, regulations, rules and industry standards in the U.S. and abroad that involve matters central to our business,\nincluding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws, regulations, rules and industry\n47\nstandards are in considerable flux and rapidly evolving, and it is possible that they may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our\ncurrent operating practices. Existing and proposed laws, regulations, rules and industry standards can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the\ndevelopment of new products and services, significantly increase our operating costs, require significant time and attention of management and technical\npersonnel and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business\npractices.\nIn addition to various privacy and data protection laws and regulations already in place, many jurisdictions are increasingly adopting laws and regulations\nimposing comprehensive privacy and data protection obligations, which may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect\nto personal information than existing laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts\nand increase compliance costs. See Item 1. “Business—Privacy and Data Protection Laws and Regulation” of the Form 10-K for more information regarding\napplicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations.\nFurther, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive and compliant with local laws, regulations, rules\nand industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims,\nproceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to privacy and data protection. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times\nfail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. If our public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information,\nwhether made through our privacy policies, information provided on our website, press statements or otherwise, are alleged to be deceptive, unfair or\nmisrepresentative of our actual practices, we may be subject to potential government or legal investigation or action, including by the Federal Trade\nCommission or applicable state attorneys general.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable privacy and data protection standards or contractual\nobligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure,\nrelease or transfer of personal information may result in claims, fines, sanctions, penalties, investigations, proceedings or actions against us by governmental\nentities, customers, suppliers or others or other liabilities or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data. Any of the foregoing could\nharm our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such claims, proceedings, investigations or actions, distract our\nmanagement, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers or suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be\ncontractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs and consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other\nlegal obligations relating to privacy and data protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store, handle or otherwise process\nas part of operating our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nWe invest significant time, resources and management attention to identifying and developing project leads that are subject to our sales and marketing\nfocus and if we are unsuccessful in converting such project leads into binding purchase orders, our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nThe commercial contracting and bidding process for solar project development is long and has multiple steps and uncertainties. We closely monitor the\ndevelopment of potential sales leads through this process. Project leads may fail to be converted into binding purchase orders at any stage of the bidding\nprocess because either (i) a competitors’ product is selected to fulfill some or all of the order due to price, functionality or other reasons or (ii) the project does\nnot progress to the stage involving the purchase of tracker systems. If we fail to convert a significant number of project leads that are subject to our sales and\nmarketing focus into binding purchase orders, our business or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties on whom we rely for new projects and who provide us with\nvaluable customer feedback that helps guide our innovation.\nIn order to continue to win business, we must maintain and enhance our long-term strategic relationships with leading EPCs, developers, owners and operators\nof solar projects. These relationships enable us to serve as strategic advisors to each of these stakeholders in a solar project, increasing the probability that our\nproduct will be selected by these stakeholders in future projects. These stakeholders also provide us with valuable customer feedback that allows us to innovate\non our products to meet the demands of our customers.\nAny loss of these relationships could result in the potential loss of new projects, and the potential loss of innovation guidance, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n48\nWe may need to defend ourselves against third-party claims that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating others’ intellectual property\nrights, which could divert management’s attention, cause us to incur significant costs, and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such\nrights relate.\nOur competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry, and may hold or obtain patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks or other intellectual property rights that could prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and\nservices. From time to time we may be subject to claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of patents or other intellectual property rights and\nrelated litigation. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, can divert management’s attention and resources, and may cause\nus to incur significant expenses in litigation or settlement and face negative publicity, and we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending\nagainst any such claims in litigation or other proceedings. If we do not successfully defend or settle an intellectual property claim, we could be liable for\nsignificant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology, business methods, content or brands, and from making,\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the products and services we offer. As a result, we could be forced to redesign our\nproducts and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. To avoid litigation or being prohibited from\nmarketing or selling the relevant products or services, we could seek a license from the applicable third party, which could require us to pay significant\nroyalties, licensing fees, or other payments, increasing our operating expenses. If a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms, we may\nbe required to develop or license a non-violating alternative, either of which could be infeasible or require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license\nor develop a non-violating alternative, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete. Moreover, there\ncould be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive\nthese results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Any of the foregoing could result in substantial\ncosts, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nFailure by our manufacturers or our component or raw material suppliers to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and\nregulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that they follow ethical business practices such\nas fair wage practices and compliance with environmental, safety, labor and other laws. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative\nmanufacturers or suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our\noperations. If our suppliers, manufacturers, or retail partners fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights\nstandards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image\ncould be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary liability and additional costs that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by any violations of the FCPA and other foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, promising, authorizing or offering improper payments or other things of value\nto foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also requires that we keep accurate books and records and\nmaintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. Other countries in which we operate also have anti-bribery laws,\nsome of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery\nlaws. However, we currently operate in and intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some\ndegree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. It is possible that our third-party\nmanufacturers, other suppliers, employees, subcontractors, agents or partners may take actions in violation of our policies or applicable anti-bribery laws. Any\nsuch violation, even if unauthorized and prohibited by our policies, could subject us to investigations, settlements, criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions,\nor negative media coverage and cause harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n49\nWe may incur obligations, liabilities or costs under environmental, health and safety laws, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur suppliers’ operations involve the use, handling, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes. As a result, our\nsuppliers are required to comply with national, state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment and health and safety. We are\nalso required to comply with general national, state, local and foreign health and safety laws and regulations in every location that we have operations,\nemployees and workers. Adoption of more stringent laws and regulations in the future, including restriction or prohibition on the use of raw materials currently\nutilized by our suppliers to manufacture products, could cause our suppliers to incur additional costs, which could increase the cost we pay for their products.\nMoreover, new environmental laws requiring changes to our suppliers’ use of raw materials could adversely impact the quality or performance of products we\ncurrently purchase. In addition, violations of, or liabilities under, these laws and regulations by our suppliers could result in our being subject to adverse\npublicity, reputational damage, substantial fines, penalties, criminal proceedings, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, cleanup costs or other\ncosts. Further, the facilities of our suppliers, including suppliers who manufacture our products, components and materials, are located on properties with a\nhistory of use involving hazardous materials, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. We may become liable under certain environmental laws and\nregulations for costs to investigate or remediate contamination at such properties and under common law for bodily injury or property damage claims arising\nfrom the alleged impact of such contamination. Liability under environmental laws and regulations for investigating and remediating contamination can be\nimposed on a joint and several basis and without regard to fault or the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination conditions. In addition, future\ndevelopments such as more aggressive enforcement policies from the Biden Administration or subsequent administrations, relevant foreign authorities or the\ndiscovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our operating costs and impact our business.\nThe majority of our sales and cash are denominated in U.S. dollars, however we do have certain contracts with third parties that are denominated in, or\notherwise affected by, other currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso,\nAustralian dollar, Chilean peso and euro, may result in foreign exchange gains or losses for us. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies\nimpacting our operating results.\nCurrency exchange rates fluctuate daily as a result of a number of factors, including changes in a country’s political and economic policies. The primary impact\nof currency exchange fluctuations is on cash, payables and expenses related to transactions in currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar. As part of\nour currency hedging strategy, we may use financial instruments such as forward exchange, swap contracts and options to hedge our foreign currency exposure\nin order to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our operating results. If our hedging activities are not successful or if we\nchange or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience unexpected fluctuations in our operating results as a result of changes in exchange\nrates.\nFurthermore, volatility in foreign exchange rates affects our ability to plan our pricing strategy. To the extent that we are unable to pass along increased costs\nand other financial effects resulting from exchange rate fluctuations to our customers, our profitability may be adversely impacted. As a result, fluctuations in\nnon-U.S. dollar currencies and the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have only operated as a separate, publicly traded company since our IPO and significant changes occurred in our cost structure, management,\nfinancing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Flex.\nPrior to the Transactions (as defined in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K), our business was operated by\nFlex as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as a separate, publicly traded company.\nFlex or one of its affiliates performed various business functions for us such as legal, finance, treasury, accounting, auditing, tax, human resources, investor\nrelations, corporate affairs, compliance support, logistics and bonding support, procurement and planning services, as well as the provision of leased facilities\nand business software and IT systems. Our cost related to such functions have increased relative to costs prior to the IPO date, and may continue to increase as\nwe reduce our reliance on Flex business functions going forward.\n50\nAdditionally, certain aspects of our business were historically integrated with the other businesses of Flex and we have shared economies of scope and scale in\ncosts, employees and vendor relationships. Although we have entered into transition agreements with Flex and continue to rely on Flex for certain business\nfunctions pursuant to such agreements, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Flex and\nmay result in us paying higher charges than in the past for these services. Further, such agreements will eventually terminate given the completion of the Spin\nTransactions (as defined in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K) and we will need to provide the services\nprovided under such agreements internally or obtain them from unaffiliated third parties, which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our\nbusiness operations. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition relative to periods prior to the IPO. In addition, Flex\nentities are the direct contracting parties with respect to our business in Brazil and we receive the benefits of those arrangements from the relevant Flex entity.\nIf we are unable to continue to operate our business in Brazil through Flex and its subsidiaries, we would need to establish alternative arrangements, and any\nsuch alternative arrangements, if available, may cause us to incur additional costs relating to that business.\nMoreover, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were historically\nsatisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Flex. In connection with the Transactions, we incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness\nin the form of senior credit facilities comprised of (i) a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million, and (ii) the Amended 2023 Credit\nAgreement (as defined in Note 7 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). See\nthe section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit\nFacilities.”. In addition, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities,\nstrategic relationships or other arrangements.\nAdditionally, our cost of capital for our businesses may be higher than Flex’s cost of capital prior to the IPO.\nFor additional information about the past financial performance of our businesses and the basis of presentation, refer to the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nWe are dependent on certain critical suppliers for certain components for our products.\nWe are dependent on certain critical suppliers for certain components of our products. Our self-powered controller (“SPC”) and network control unit (“NCU”)\nused in our tracker products are predominately manufactured by Flex. We have an agreement with Flex for the manufacturing of these components, but we\noperate on a purchase order basis for pricing. The processes to manufacture these SPCs and NCUs are highly complex, specialized and proprietary. Although\nwe have recently added two suppliers who manufacture our SPCs, if Flex is unable or unwilling to manufacture controllers for us, or increases its pricing\nsubstantially, a substantial portion of our supply of these critical components would be interrupted or delayed and we may not be able to source substitute parts\neasily. We would incur increased expenses in establishing new relationships with alternative manufacturers at market prices. We may not be able to source\nalternative components on term acceptable to us or in a timely and cost-effective manner which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and profitability.\nWe are a holding company and our principal asset is our LLC common units in the LLC, and accordingly we are dependent upon distributions from the\nLLC to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and, as a result of the Transactions and the IPO, our principal asset is our ownership of the LLC. The LLC is treated as a partnership\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of its LLC\ncommon units, including us. We had no operations prior to the Transactions and had no independent means of generating revenue. As the managing member of\nthe LLC, we intend to cause the LLC to make distributions to us according to the LLC Agreement to cover the taxes on our allocable share of the taxable\nincome of the LLC, all applicable taxes payable by us, any payments we are obligated to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement and other costs or\nexpenses. Distributions will generally be made on a pro rata basis among us and the other holders of LLC common units. However, certain laws and\nregulations may result in restrictions on the LLC’s ability to make distributions to us or the ability of the LLC’s subsidiaries to make distributions to it.\nTo the extent that we need funds and the LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions, we may not be able to obtain such funds on\nterms acceptable to us or at all and as a result could suffer an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\n51\nTax authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions.\nOur taxable income comes primarily from the allocation of taxable income from the LLC. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States\non the taxable income allocated to us from the LLC. In addition, while the majority of the LLC’s income comes from United States sources and will not be\nsubject to LLC level income tax, the LLC has taxable income in some foreign subsidiaries that is subject to foreign country’s corporate income tax. We may be\nentitled to foreign tax credits in the United States for our shares of the foreign tax we paid. As the LLC operates in a number of countries and relies on\nintercompany transfer pricing benchmarking analysis, judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of the LLC’s\nbusiness, there may be transactions or intercompany transfer prices where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, calculations of income\ntaxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we and the LLC are required\nto file tax returns.\nIn certain circumstances, the LLC will be required to make distributions to us and the other holders of its common units, which may be substantial and in\nexcess of our tax liabilities and obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs noted above, the LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable\nincome is allocated to holders of its common units, including us. We anticipate that, pursuant to the tax rules under the Code and the regulations thereunder, in\nmany instances these allocations of taxable income will not be made on a pro rata basis.\nNotwithstanding that, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the LLC generally is required from time to time to make pro rata cash distributions, or tax distributions,\nto the holders of LLC common units to help each of the holders of the LLC common units to pay taxes on such holder’s allocable share of taxable income of\nthe LLC. As a result of potential non pro rata allocations of net taxable income allocable to us and the other holders of LLC common units, the difference in tax\nrates applicable to corporations and individuals and the favorable tax benefits from the IPO, the subsequent follow-on offering in 2023, and certain related\ntransactions, we expect that these tax distributions will be in amounts that exceed our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. To the extent, as currently expected, we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example,\nhold such cash balances or lend them to the LLC, the existing owners of the LLC would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances\nas a result of an exchange of their LLC common units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock under the Exchange Agreement (as defined in Note 6\nin the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K).\nWe are required to pay others for certain tax benefits that we are deemed to realize under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the amounts we may pay\ncould be significant.\nWe used all of the net proceeds from the IPO to purchase LLC common units from Yuma and we used all of the net proceeds from the subsequent follow-on\noffering to purchase LLC common units from Yuma and TPG Rise, an affiliate of TPG. Additionally, we may be required from time to time to acquire\nadditional LLC common units together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class B common stock in exchange for our Class A common stock (or\ncash) pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. See Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K. We expect that basis\nadjustments resulting from these transactions, if they occur, among other tax benefits resulting from the Transactions, will reduce the amount of income tax we\nwould otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nWe entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the LLC, Yuma, Yuma Sub, TPG Rise and the TPG Affiliates in connection with our IPO. Prior to the Spin\nTransactions, Yuma and Yuma Sub assigned their respective rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement to an entity that remains an affiliate of Flex. The Tax\nReceivable Agreement provides for the payment by us to Flex’s affiliate, TPG and the TPG Affiliates (or certain permitted transferees thereof) of 85% of the\ntax benefits, if any, that we are deemed to realize under certain circumstances as a result of (i) our allocable share of existing tax basis in tangible and intangible\nassets resulting from exchanges or acquisitions of the LLC common units, including as part of the Transactions or under the Exchange Agreement, (ii)\nincreases in tax basis resulting from exchanges or acquisitions of outstanding LLC common units and shares of Class B common stock (including as part of the\nTransactions, the subsequent follow-on offering or under the Exchange Agreement), (iii) certain pre-existing tax attributes of certain blocker corporations\naffiliated with TPG that each merged with a separate direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of us, as part of the Transactions, and (iv) certain other tax benefits\nrelated to our entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n52\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement\nexceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement or distributions to us by the LLC are not sufficient\nto permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after we have paid taxes. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax\nbenefits that are deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIn certain cases, our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to others may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize\nin respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain circumstances we will be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the\nanticipated future tax benefits, including upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control (with certain\nexceptions, such as the Spin Distribution and the Mergers (as such terms are defined in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in\nthe Form 10-K)), if we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination\nof the Tax Receivable Agreement. The amount of any such payment would be based on certain assumptions, including that we (or our successor) would have\nsufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the\nTax Receivable Agreement. As a result, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than or less than the\npercentage specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement of the actual benefits that we realize in respect of the tax attributes that are subject to the Tax Receivable\nAgreement and the upfront payment may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits (if any). Under certain circumstances,\nincluding an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact\non our liquidity, as well as our attractiveness as a target for an acquisition. In addition, we may not be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine except with respect to the agreed tax\ntreatment provided for in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Tax Receivable Agreement and a related side letter (the “TRA Side Letter,”), which is treated as\npart of the Tax Receivable Agreement, provide that the parties will treat payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and TRA Side Letter that are\nattributable to certain tax benefits from exchanges of LLC common units under the Exchange Agreement and from the purchase of LLC common units from\nYuma and TPG (with the net proceeds of the IPO and follow-on) as upward purchase price adjustments to the extent permitted by law and other than amounts\ntreated as interest under the Code. We will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, even if the tax benefits\nunderlying such payment are disallowed (although future amounts otherwise payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be reduced as a result thereof).\nIn addition, the actual state or local tax savings we realize may be different than the amount of such tax savings we are deemed to realize under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, which will be based on an assumed combined state and local tax rate applied to our reduction in taxable income as determined for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes as a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement in excess of the benefits that we actually realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs a newly public company, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy,\nhave resulted in increased costs and diverted resources and management attention from operating our business.\nIn February 2023, we completed our IPO. As a result, we are required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified\nin the Exchange Act and SEC regulations. Thus, we will need to ensure that we have the ability to prepare, on a timely basis, financial statements that comply\nwith SEC reporting requirements. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the listing standards of Nasdaq and\nthe provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant new\ncompliance obligations upon us. As a public company, we are required, among other things, to:\n• prepare and distribute periodic reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and\nNasdaq rules;\n• define and expand the roles and the duties of our board of directors and its committees;\n53\n• institute more comprehensive compliance, investor relations and internal audit functions;\n• evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and\n• involve and retain outside legal counsel and accountants in connection with the activities listed above.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an\nannual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to have our independent registered public\naccounting firm attest to, and issue an opinion on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to assert that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports,\nwhich would cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management oversight that has increased and may\ncontinue to increase our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management’s attention might be diverted from other\nbusiness concerns.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various claims, suits, investigations and legal proceedings. Such legal claims or regulatory matters could involve matters\nrelating to commercial disputes, government regulatory and compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, employment or shareholder issues, product liability\nclaims and other issues on a global basis. If we receive an adverse judgment in any such matter, we could be required to pay substantial damages and cease\ncertain practices or activities. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation and other proceedings may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our\nbusiness. The defense and ultimate outcome of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses and a decrease in operating\nmargin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny existing or future lawsuits could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key\nemployees, as well as harm our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility, financial condition and our competitive position.\nIn connection with the Transactions, we incurred substantial indebtedness under the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement. The obligations of the borrower, the\nLLC, under the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement and related loan documents are severally guaranteed by us and certain of the LLC’s existing and future direct\nand indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. Our level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate\ncash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our indebtedness could have other important consequences to you and significant effects on\nour business. For example, it could:\n• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability\nof our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n• restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n• make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n• place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n54\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business\nstrategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement contains, and the agreements evidencing or governing any other future indebtedness may contain, restrictive\ncovenants that limit or will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could\nresult in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. In addition, a default by us under the\nAmended 2023 Credit Agreement or an agreement governing any other future indebtedness may trigger cross-defaults under any other future agreements\ngoverning our indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default or cross-default under any of the present or future agreements governing our\nindebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements. If any\nof our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nThe Amended 2023 Credit Agreement contains, and the agreements evidencing or governing any other future indebtedness may contain, financial restrictions\non us and our subsidiaries, including restrictions on our or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:\n• place liens on our or our subsidiaries’ assets;\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• change the nature of our business; and\n• change our or our subsidiaries’ fiscal year or organizational documents.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, stock\nrepurchases or other purposes. It may also increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, market and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for,\nor reacting to, changes in our business operations or to our industry overall, and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors that have lower debt\nlevels. Any or all of the foregoing events and/or factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to access capital markets, taking into account our financial condition, regulatory capital ratios, business strategies,\nanticipated asset growth and other relevant considerations. It is possible that future acquisitions, organic growth or changes in regulatory capital requirements\ncould require us to increase the amount or change the composition of our current capital, including our common equity. For all of these reasons and others, and\nalways subject to market conditions, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other capital securities in public or private transactions.\nThe issuance of additional common stock, debt, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or that represent the right to receive\ncommon stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock have no\npreemptive or other rights that would entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or\nofferings could result in dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the near term, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your\nsole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use\nin the operation and expansion of our future businesses and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Should we decide in the\nfuture to pay cash dividends on our common stock, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of\ndividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. In addition, the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement restricts, and any future financing agreements may also\nrestrict, our ability to pay dividends. In particular, the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends on\n55\nour common stock except where certain conditions are met. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of potential\ngain for the foreseeable future.\nServicing our debt requires cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nThe LLC’s ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance,\nwhich is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations\nin the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt\none or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our\nability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these\nactivities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of\nwhich may be secured debt. Our Amended 2023 Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if\nthe facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nRisks related to our Class A common stock\nThe price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has since the IPO fluctuated substantially, is highly volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to\nmany factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to operating performance.\nThese fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in trading price of\nour common stock include the following:\n• volume and customer mix for our products;\n• the introduction of new products by us or others in our industry;\n• disputes or other developments with respect to our or others’ intellectual property rights;\n• product liability claims or other litigation;\n• quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;\n• media exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry;\n• changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications;\n• changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n• general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\nand\n• changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, including as a result of future issuances of securities, sales of large blocks of Class A common\nstock by our stockholders, TPG and our employees, or our incurrence of debt.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the\noperating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our Class A common stock,\nregardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market\nprice. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of\n56\nthe merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would harm our financial condition and operating results and divert\nmanagement’s attention and resources from our business.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class share structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class share structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, adverse publicity or\nother adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in\ncertain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it would require new constituents of its indices to have greater than 5% of a company’s\nvoting rights in the hands of public stockholders. Under such policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in\ncertain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our\nClass A common stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, these policies will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from such indices, but\nit is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive\nstrategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our\nClass A common stock less attractive to other investors. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multi-\nclass share structures. As a result, our multi-class share structure may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate\ngovernance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our\nClass A common stock. As a result of the foregoing factors, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock\nprice or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock may be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish\nabout us and our business. We do not control these analysts. As a newly public company, the analysts who publish information about our Class A common\nstock may have relatively little experience with us, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail\nto meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price,\nour stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in\nthe market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating\nresults could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets,\nliabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. It is possible that interpretation, industry practice and guidance may\nevolve over time. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could\nfall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger,\nacquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a\npremium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common\nstock, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of\n57\ndirectors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt\nby our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the\nperson acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for\nsubstantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with\nus or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery\nof the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of\nDelaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nexclusive forum provision will not apply to any claim to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal\ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America\nwill be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. We believe this exclusive forum provision\nbenefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes,\nefficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However,\nsuch provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in\nother companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought\nagainst us, a court could find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable in such action.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce\nthe amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145\nof the DGCL.\nIn addition, as permitted by the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into\nwith our directors and officers provide that:\n• we will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest\nextent permitted by applicable law. Such law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a\nmanner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable\ncause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful;\n• we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n• we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or\nofficers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n• the rights conferred in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification\nagreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n• we may not retroactively amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to\ndirectors, officers, employees and agent.\n58\nRisks related to the Spin Transactions\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, Nextracker will be restricted from taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the\nSpin Distribution or the Mergers, and such restrictions could significantly impair Nextracker’s ability to implement strategic initiatives that otherwise\nwould be beneficial.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement was entered into by us, Yuma and Flex immediately prior to the Spin Distribution and which governs the rights, responsibilities\nand obligations of such parties with respect to taxes (including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business and taxes incurred as a result of the Tax\nDistributions, as defined in Note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K (the “Distributions”), and the Mergers), tax\nattributes, tax returns, tax contests and certain other matters (the “Tax Matters Agreement”), generally imposes certain restrictions on Nextracker that could\nadversely affect the intended tax treatment of the Spin Distribution or the Mergers, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of these restrictions, Nextracker’s,\nability to engage in certain transactions, such as the issuance or purchase of stock or certain business combinations, may be limited.\nIf we take any enumerated actions or omissions, or if certain events relating to us occur that would cause the Spin Distribution or the Mergers to become\ntaxable, we may be required to bear the cost of any resulting tax liability under the Tax Matters Agreement. Any such indemnification obligation likely would\nbe substantial and likely would have a material adverse effect on us. These restrictions may reduce our ability to engage in certain business transactions that\notherwise might be advantageous to us, which could adversely affect our business, result of operations or financial condition.\nGeneral risk factors\nIf we fail to manage our future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer service or adequately\naddress competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods. We intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets. This\ngrowth has placed, and any future growth may place, a significant strain on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. In particular, we will be\nrequired to expand, train and manage our growing employee base and scale and improve our IT infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth. Our\nmanagement will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and\nsuppliers, as well as manage multiple geographic locations.\nOur current and planned operations, personnel, IT and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth and may require us to\nmake additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to\nmanage these changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to take advantage of market\nopportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction,\nincreased costs, difficulties in introducing new offerings or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our\nreputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth\nand our business could suffer.\nOur future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and on the continued\ncontributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. All of our employees,\nincluding our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time.\nCompetition for highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense, and we face challenges identifying, hiring and retaining qualified\npersonnel in many areas of our business. Integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations, require substantial resources and\nmanagement attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful. An inability to retain our senior management and other key personnel or to attract additional qualified\npersonnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\n59\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of key management\npersonnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have, and in the future expect to continue to make, investments in and/or acquire complementary companies, services or\ntechnologies, such as our recent acquisitions of Ojjo and the foundations business of SPI. Our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other\ncompanies, services or technologies in a successful manner in the future is not guaranteed. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we\nmay not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. When we complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive\nposition or ability to achieve our business objectives, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers or investors. In\naddition, our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or\nother accounting practices or issues with employees or customers. If we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with\nsuch acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may\nrequire significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired\ntechnology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, causing unanticipated write-offs or accounting charges. We\nmay have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability\nto manage our operations.\nITEM 2.

PURPOSES OF THE PLAN.\nThe purposes of the Second Amended and Restated 2022 Nextracker Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) are to attract and retain the best available\npersonnel, to provide additional incentives to Employees, Directors and Consultants, to give recognition to the contributions made or to be made by Outside\nDirectors to the success of the Company and to promote the success of the Company’s business by linking the personal interests of Employees, Directors and\nConsultants to those of the Company’s stockholders and by providing such individuals with an incentive for outstanding performance to generate superior\nreturns to the Company’s stockholders. The Plan was previously adopted effective February 1, 2022, and was amended and restated thereafter, effective April 6,\n2022, as the First Amended and Restated 2022 Nextracker LLC Equity Incentive Plan (the “First Restatement”), and the First Restatement was amended\npursuant to the First Amendment to the First Amended and Restated 2022 Nextracker LLC Equity Incentive Plan, effective January 30, 2023 (the “First\nAmendment”), in each case by Nextracker LLC, but in connection with the IPO, the Plan, as modified by the First Restatement and the First Amendment\n(collectively, the “Prior Plan”), was assumed by Nextracker Inc. and amended and restated in the form of the Plan. On June 14, 2024, the Plan was further\namended and restated to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance pursuant to Awards under the Plan by an additional\n11,100,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to stockholder approval.\nArticle 2.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates\nevidencing shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise or vesting of any Award, unless and until the Committee has determined, with advice of counsel,\nthat the issuance and delivery of such certificates is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if applicable, the\nrequirements of any exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or traded. All certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock delivered pursuant to the\nPlan are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal, state local, securities\nor other laws, including laws of jurisdictions outside the U.S., rules and regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation\nsystem on which the Common Stock is listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee may place legends on any certificate evidencing shares of Common Stock to\nreference restrictions applicable to the Common Stock. In addition to the terms and conditions provided herein, the Committee may require that a Participant\nmake such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the Committee, in its discretion, deems advisable in order to comply with any such laws,\nregulations, or requirements. The Committee shall have the right to require any Participant to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the\nsettlement or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of the Committee.\n8.7 Accelerated Vesting and Deferral Limitations. The Committee shall not have the discretionary authority to accelerate or delay issuance of the\nCommon Stock under an Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, except to the extent that such\nacceleration or delay\n11\nmay, in the discretion of the Committee, be effected in a manner that shall not cause any person to incur taxes, interest or penalties under Section 409A of the\nCode.\n8.8 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. No dividends may be paid to a Participant with respect to an Award prior to the vesting of such Award.\nAn Award may provide for dividends or dividend equivalents to accrue on behalf of a Participant as of each dividend payment date during the period between\nthe date the Award is granted and the date the Award is exercised, vested, expired, credited or paid, and to be converted to vested cash or Common Stock at the\nsame time and subject to the same vesting conditions that apply to the Common Stock to which such dividends or dividend equivalents relate.\nArticle 9. CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE.\n9.1 Adjustments. Should any change be made to the Common Stock issuable under the Plan by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,\nextraordinary dividend, recapitalization, combination, exchange, spin-off or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the\nCompany’s receipt of consideration, then appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan,\n(ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any Participant may be granted Awards under the terms of the Plan or that may be granted\ngenerally under the terms of the Plan, and (iii) the number and/or class of securities and price per share of Common Stock in effect under each Award\noutstanding under Articles 5 through 7. Such adjustments to the outstanding Awards are to be effected in a manner which shall preclude the enlargement or\ndilution of rights and benefits under such Awards. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an adjustment to an Award under this Section 9.1 may not\nbe made in a manner that would result in the grant of a new Option or SAR under Section 409A of the Code. The adjustments determined by the Committee\nshall be final, binding and conclusive.\n9.2 Change of Control.\n(a) Notwithstanding Section 9.1 hereof, and except as may otherwise be provided in any applicable Award Agreement or other written\nagreement entered into between the Company and a Participant, if a Change of Control occurs and a Participant’s Full-Value Awards are not converted,\nassumed, or replaced by a comparable award by a successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, such Full-Value Awards shall\nautomatically vest and become fully exercisable and all forfeiture restrictions on such Awards shall lapse immediately prior to the Change of Control and\nfollowing the consummation of such Change of Control, the Award shall terminate and cease to be outstanding. Further, if a Change of Control occurs and a\nParticipant’s Options or SARs are not converted, assumed or replaced by a comparable award by a successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary\nthereof, such Options or SARs outstanding at the time of the Change of Control, shall automatically vest and become fully exercisable immediately prior to the\nChange of Control and thereafter shall automatically terminate. In the event that the terms of any agreement (other than the Award Agreement) between the\nCompany or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate and a Participant contains provisions that conflict with and are more restrictive than the provisions of this\nSection 9.2(a), this Section 9.2(a) shall prevail and control and the more restrictive terms of such agreement (and only such terms) shall be of no force or effect.\nThe determination of comparability in this Section 9.2(a) shall be made by the Committee, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.\n(b) The portion of any Incentive Stock Option accelerated in connection with a Change of Control shall remain exercisable as an\nIncentive Stock Option only to the extent the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation is not exceeded. To the extent such dollar\nlimitation is exceeded, the accelerated portion of such Option shall be exercisable as a Non-Qualified Stock Option under the U.S. federal tax laws.\n9.3 No Other Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation\nof Common Stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any\n12\nincrease or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of the Company or any\nother corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or pursuant to action of the Committee under the Plan, no issuance by the Company of Common\nStock of any class, or securities convertible into Common Stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to,\nthe number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Award or the grant or the Exercise Price of any Award.\nArticle 10. ADMINISTRATION.\n10.1 Authority of Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Committee or by the Board acting as the Committee. Subject to the general\npurposes, terms and conditions of the Plan, and to the direction of the Board, the Committee shall have full power to implement and carry out the Plan.

Any determination made by the Committee with respect to any Award shall be made in its sole discretion at the time\nof grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan or Award, at any later time, and such determination shall be final and binding\non the Company and on all persons having an interest in any Award under the Plan.\n10.3 Delegation of Authority. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may from time to time delegate to a committee of one (1)\nor more members of the Board or one (1) or more officers of the Company the authority to grant or amend Awards to Participants other than Insiders to whom\nauthority to grant or amend Awards has been delegated hereunder, by the Committee, or by the Compensation and People Committee of Flex, Ltd., a limited\ncompany organized under the laws of Singapore and indirect Parent of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, provided it meets the limitation in the\npreceding sentence, this delegation shall include the right to modify Awards as necessary to accommodate changes in the laws or regulations, including in\njurisdictions outside the U.S. Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Committee specifies at the time of such delegation,\nand the Committee may at any time rescind the authority so delegated or appoint a new delegate. At all times, the delegate appointed under this Section 10.3\nshall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Committee.\nArticle 11. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATE.\n11.1 Effective Date. The Plan is effective as August 19, 2024 (the “Effective Date”) on which the Plan as adopted by the Board was approved by\nits stockholders.\n11.2 Expiration Date. The Plan shall expire on, and no Award may be granted pursuant to the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date.\nAny Awards that are outstanding on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date shall remain in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable\nAward Agreement.\nArticle 12. AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION.\n12.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. The Committee has complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan\n(or any component thereof) in any or all respects whatsoever. However, no such amendment or modification shall materially and adversely affect rights and\nobligations with respect to Awards at the time outstanding under the Plan, unless the Participant consents to such amendment. In addition, except as provided in\nthe Plan, the Committee may not, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, amend the Plan to (i) increase the maximum number of shares of\nCommon Stock issuable under the Plan, (ii) materially modify the eligibility requirements for Plan participation or (iii) materially increase the benefits accruing\nto Participants. Further, the repricing, replacement or regranting of any previously granted Award, through cancellation or by lowering the Exercise Price of\nsuch Award, shall be prohibited unless the stockholders of the Company first approve such repricing, replacement or regranting. No underwater Option or SAR\nmay be cancelled in exchange for, or in connection with the payment of a cash amount without stockholder approval. The Committee may at any time\nterminate or amend the Plan in any respect, including without limitation amendment of any form of Award\n14\nAgreement or instrument to be executed pursuant to the Plan; provided, however, that the Committee shall not, without the requisite stockholder approvals,\namend the Plan in any manner that requires such stockholder approval under the stock exchange listing requirements then applicable to the Company.\n12.2 Awards Previously Granted. Except with respect to amendments made pursuant to Section 13.13 hereof, no termination, amendment, or\nmodification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted pursuant to the Plan without the prior written consent of the\nParticipant; provided, however, that an amendment or modification that may cause an Incentive Stock Option to become a Non-Qualified Stock Option shall\nnot be treated as adversely affecting the rights of the Participant.\nArticle 13. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n13.1 No Rights to Awards. No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and neither\nthe Company nor the Committee is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Participants or any other persons uniformly.\n13.2 No Stockholder Rights. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the\nCommon Stock covered by any Award, including the right to vote or receive dividends, until the Participant becomes the owner of such Common Stock,\nnotwithstanding the exercise or vesting of an Option or other Award.\n13.3 Withholding. The Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, as appropriate, shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or\nrequire a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy U.S. federal, state, or local taxes and any taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside of\nthe U.S. (including income tax, social insurance contributions, payment on account and any other taxes that may be due) required by law to be withheld with\nrespect to any taxable event concerning a Participant arising as a result of the Plan or to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the\nCompany or a Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate, as appropriate, to satisfy withholding obligations for the payment of taxes by any means authorized by the\nCommittee. No Common Stock shall be delivered hereunder to any Participant or other person until the Participant or such other person has made arrangements\nacceptable to the Committee for the satisfaction of these tax obligations with respect to any taxable event concerning the Participant or such other person\narising as a result of Awards made under the Plan.\n13.4 No Right to Employment or Services. Nothing in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the\nCompany or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate any Participant’s employment or services at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to\ncontinue in the employ or service of the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate.\n13.5 Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet\nmade to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than\nthose of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate.\n13.6 Relationship to Other Benefits. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits pursuant to any\npension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, termination programs and/or indemnities or severance payments, welfare or other benefit plan of\nthe Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder,\nor as expressly provided by applicable law.\n13.7 Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates.\n15\n13.8 Titles and Headings. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any\nconflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.\n13.9 Fractional Shares of Common Stock. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued and the Committee shall determine, in its\ndiscretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by rounding down as appropriate.\n13.10 Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award granted or awarded\nto any Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule\nunder Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application of such\nexemptive rule. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary\nto conform to such applicable exemptive rule.\n13.11 Government and Other Regulations.\n(a) The obligation of the Company to make payment of awards in shares of Common Stock or otherwise shall be subject to all\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations of the U.S. and jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and to such approvals by government agencies, including government\nagencies in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., in each case as may be required or as the Company deems necessary or advisable. Without limiting the foregoing,\nthe Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any Common Stock subject to Awards granted hereunder prior to: (i) obtaining any approvals from\ngovernmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable, and (ii) completion of any registration or other qualification with respect to the\nCommon Stock under any applicable law in the U.S. or in a jurisdiction outside of the U.S. or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to\nbe necessary or advisable or at a time when any such registration or qualification is not current, has been suspended or otherwise has ceased to be effective. The\ninability or impracticability of the Company to obtain or maintain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the\nCompany’s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the\nfailure to issue or sell such Common Stock as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. The Company shall be under no obligation to\nregister the Common Stock issued or paid pursuant to the Plan under the Securities Act. If the shares of Common Stock subject to the Plan may in certain\ncircumstances be exempt from registration pursuant to the Securities Act the Company may restrict the issuance and delivery of such Common Stock in such\nmanner as it deems advisable to ensure the availability of any such exemption.\n(b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Prior Plan and the Legacy Awards issued thereunder were originally\nintended to qualify as a compensatory benefit plan within the meaning of Rule 701 of the Securities Act (and any similarly applicable state “blue-sky”\nsecurities laws) with respect to periods preceding the IPO; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict or limit the application of any other exemption from\nregistration under the Securities Act in connection therewith.\n13.12 Governing Law. The Plan and all Award Agreements, and all controversies thereunder or related thereto, shall be construed in accordance\nwith and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws.\n13.13 Section 409A. Except as provided in Section 13.14 hereof, to the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under the Plan\nis subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of\nthe Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and U.S. Department of\nTreasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued\nafter the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Committee determines that\n16\nany Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related U.S. Department of Treasury guidance (including such U.S. Department of Treasury\nguidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement or adopt\nother policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines\nare necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with\nrespect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related U.S. Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid\nthe application of any penalty taxes under such Section. If a Participant is identified by the Company as a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section\n409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code on the date on which the Participant has a “separation from service” (other than due to death) within the meaning of Treasury\nRegulation § 1.409A-1( h), any Award payable or settled on account of a separation from service that is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the\nCode shall be paid or settled on the earliest of (i) as soon as practicable after, but in no event more than ten (10) days after, the first business day following the\nexpiration of six (6) months from the Participant’s separation from service, (ii) as soon as practicable after the date of the Participant’s death, or (iii) such\nearlier date as complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.\n13.14 No Representations or Covenants with respect to Tax Qualification. Although the Company may endeavor to (a) qualify an Award for\nfavorable tax treatment under the laws of the U.S. (e.g., Incentive Stock Options) or jurisdictions outside of the U.S. or (b) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g.,\nunder Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid\nunfavorable tax treatment, anything to the contrary in the Plan, including Section 13.13 hereof, notwithstanding. The Company shall be unconstrained in its\ncorporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on holders of Awards under the Plan.\n17\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION OF THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER PURSUANT\nTO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\nI, Daniel Shugar, certify that:\n1.

Shugar\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThank you, Mary, and thank you all for joining our Q2 earnings call. We are very pleased with the continued\nstrong execution by the company across the board in products, sales and operations, driving solid financial\nperformance. Before we cover the company's performance, I'd like to offer a few comments on the upcoming\nelection in the United States, which is our largest market. There have been questions addressed to Nextracker\nand our sector regarding the potential impact of the election on solar. We believe our company and industry will\ngrow regardless of election outcome, as we have steadily grown through prior Democratic and Republican\nadministrations.\nWe believe we will be successful in any scenario because energy projects are less about politics and more about\neconomics. And solar is the lowest cost form of energy in most markets. It's about the maturity of projects in\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\ndevelopment in the interconnection queue. And it's about the availability of capital to finance projects, where risks\nare considered in all of these areas solar shines. The US has a growing appetite for new power and we believe\nsolar and battery projects are best positioned to satisfy that need. Further most of the manufacturing investments\nin solar power plants in the country are located in red states, and the underpinning economic value delivered to\nthose states is significant and real. So much so that 18 Republican members of the House of Representatives\nsent a unified letter to Speaker Johnson in support of the IRA, demonstrating again the bipartisan support for\nclean energy and why we believe key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act will persist independent of the\noutcome of the upcoming election. In summary, we believe Nextracker will continue to grow in the US under\neither administration.\nAnd now let's turn to our company performance. Q2 was another quarter of strong execution, marking our seventh\nconsecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Revenue for the first half of our fiscal 2025\nwas a record with an increase of 29% year-over-year. We continue to see strong demand for our products\nglobally across all regions, driven in part by a flight to quality, across a range of criteria that matter to customers.\nWe strongly believe that Nextracker offers the highest quality and most reliable product on the market, with the\nlowest installed cost, lowest operating cost, [ph] ICE production (00:21:01) and differentiated technology in\nengineering.\nWe believe these factors will help to drive demand and enable pricing discipline. Our team is also differentiated\nwith sector domain expertise, a robust global supply chain that delivers products on time and a customer service\nethic that measures in response to customer requirements at each phase of the customer journey. Customers are\nrewarding these values with sales orders. Our backlog increased significantly quarter-over-quarter to a new\nrecord of over $4.5 billion. And we are pleased with the margin profile of our backlog for this fiscal year and\nbeyond. As a result of the new orders, we are raising our profit target for the full fiscal year by $20 million at the\nmidpoint to $645 million. We are also receiving customer orders for our new products, including NX Horizon-XTR\n1.5 and Horizon Low Carbon Tracker and NX Hail Pro-75 and both our new NX Foundation technologies, all of\nthese products have been successfully deployed in the field. Most of these products resulted from focused R&D\ninvestments made by Nextracker.\nIn Q2, we inaugurated our third global design facility, Nextracker Center of Solar Excellence in Hyderabad, India,\na 13-acre facility with a 30,000 square foot state-of-the-art laboratory. Our three global design labs incubate and\ncommercialize PV technologies, localized for regional needs and optimize products for customer requirements. As\nwe are serving projects in over 40 countries around the world.\nA few months ago, in response to customer demand, we accelerated to Q3 of this year, the availability of our\n100% domestically manufactured tracker. We received customer orders for it, which will ship later this quarter.\nTo our knowledge, we are the only tracker manufacturer that can deliver a 100% US manufactured tracker. This\ncapability can provide tremendous benefits to US customers because it enables them to achieve a much higher\nscore on their domestic content and can enable them to capture the 10% bonus investment tax credit or ITC.\nOn a typical 100 megawatt system, the 10% bonus ITC can have a value to the customer of roughly $10 million\nequivalent approximately to the entire cost of the tracker. Last quarter, we announced the closing of two\nfoundation business acquisitions, which are on track to be successfully integrated by the end of the fiscal year.\nAt the RE+ North American Conference last month, we debuted our NX Foundation Solutions business and\ncustomer reception exceeded expectations. We have signed new bookings orders for our foundation solution and\nour NX Horizon trackers and see a robust pipeline for new business. We're excited for what our foundation\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nsolutions will do for our customers, enabling quicker, safer and more efficient solar project development on a wide\nrange of soil types for EPC and developer customers.\nIn summary, it was a great first half of fiscal 2025 and we remain focused on executing our plan to achieve\ndouble-digit revenue growth for the full year, with a raised profitability target. Looking forward, we expect fiscal\n2026 to be another growth year comprised of both our legacy products such as NX Horizon and the five new\nproduct offerings I just mentioned. The customer demand for our industry leading products and our ability to\nexecute and support customers' success give us the confidence to achieve our growth supported by our growing\nbacklog.\nWe now look forward to your questions. Let me pass the call back to the operator.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask\nthat you please limit yourself to one question. Our first question today comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital\nPartners. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPhilip Shen Q\nAnalyst, ROTH Capital Partners\nHi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the very strong quarter. I wanted to check in on the\nbookings. Our math suggests bookings were close to, if not greater than a $1 billion for the quarter. I was\nwondering, if you could talk through what the margin profile looks like for the bookings. Dan, I think you mentioned\nin your remarks that you were pleased with the margins. Can you kind of give us a baseline or comparison to the\nstrong margins from this quarter? And do you think the bookings are in line with that maybe a little bit lower or\nhigher? And then, when you think about the new bookings, how much of that was your new products and do you\nhave any new MSA agreements or volume commitment orders or obligations in that backlog as well? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThank you, Phil, and thanks for the multifaceted question. Appreciate that. This is Dan. Howard, can you weigh in\non the first question?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nSure. Hey, Phil. This is Howard. So we had another strong quarter of performance, both on revenue, P&L,\nprofitability and bookings. And so raising our backlog to a new record over $4.5 billion is a great milestone for the\ncompany. As far as the – and the mix matters, what's in the new bookings and what's in the backlog? And what\nwe said is about two-thirds of our business is the guidepost for US domestic, one-third rest of world. And we call\nthat out, because the rest of the world has some select competitive markets such as the Middle East, which is the\nlowest cost electricity, solar electricity market in the world, where you have pricing that's at $0.01 to $0.02 per\nkilowatt hour, okay. And so, our pricing and margins can vary and do vary by region.\nWith that said, the new bookings that we have, we're very happy with the mix, it's consistent with the two-thirds,\none-third mix that we talk about, two-thirds US, one-third rest of world and the margin profile on both – for both of\nthose contributions and then to the overall is very much in line with our profitability and going forward. As far as\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nthe type of – do we have MSAs [ph] VCAs (00:28:50) in the bookings? And the answer is, yes. Thank you, Phil,\nfor your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPraneeth Satish Q\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nThanks. I echo Phil's comments on, on a strong quarter. You mentioned that you expect to realize 90% of the\nbacklog in eight quarters. I think that's a slight improvement from last quarter, where you said you expect to\nrealize 80% of the backlog in eight quarters. Can you talk about what's helping shrink that timeline? Is it simply\njust a higher mix of international projects with a faster revenue conversion cycle? Or are you seeing an\nimprovement on the US side?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nIt's both actually. We're getting orders with shorter horizons and that's what fed the backlog increase and caused\nthat metric to go from 80% to 90%, 90% of expected revenues – 90% of our revenue in backlog we expect to\nrecognize over the next eight quarters. And so, yeah, that's – it's a, it's an equal contribution on both with shorter\ncycles.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPraneeth Satish Q\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nOkay. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nYeah. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Strouse Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. On page 5 of the shareholder\nletter, you talk about double-digit growth, revenue growth in fiscal 2025, [ph] but then the (00:30:41) growth in\nfiscal 2026. Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but is there a reasoning, a reason that you're stopping short of saying\ndouble-digit growth in fiscal 2026? Are you kind of just talking about the visibility that you have from your backlog?\nOr is there something else that, that you're seeing in kind of bookings activity? Maybe that's making you think that\nit might be less than double-digit growth next year? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nHi, Mark. Dan Shugar here. The – we'll provide a lot more color on the FY 2026 revenue plan in subsequent\nearnings calls is the answer. So we'll provide, we'll provide more then. I will just say, the company has never been\nin a better position than it is today, $4.5 billion of backlog. We've seen Howard's covered. We've seen great\ngrowth among, many regions around the world, it's super to have multiple regions in the world all contributing\nsteady growth and quarter-to-quarter one region will be stronger than in other region. The first half of this fiscal\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nyear we saw – the first half of this fiscal year, we saw a really – hi there's some noise on the phone, not sure\nwhere that's coming from.\nOkay, thank you. So we saw very strong growth in higher value regions the first half of this year – our fiscal year.\nAnd the second half of the year is. We're seeing stronger planned shipments in lower value, more competitive\nregions, as Howard mentioned, such as the Middle East. But on balance, we're doing what we said, we were\ngoing to do, going out, growing the company, double-digit growth this year. We're hitting our revenue plan and\nwe've been able to beat and raise on our profitability expectations. Thanks for the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Dimple Gosai with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDimple Gosai Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nHi. Good evening and thanks for the question. Can you please speak a little bit about, some of the competitive\ndynamics, what we're seeing in terms of, customer behavior also ahead of elections versus rushing to kind of get\nsome of the domestic product through the door. And then also a little bit about, your new customer wins. Is that\nmore in the US versus international? I think you quoted 12 or 8 new customers, sorry.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nOkay. This is Howard. So, what we're seeing in the market is continued very solid demand across all of our major\nregions in North America, Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand. We're seeing\njust across the board a lot of demand. And that's being driven by the increased demand for electricity,\nelectrification of the world, data centers, hyperscalers, electric vehicles and demand for clean energy. And so,\nthere is a macro overlay on the demand picture. And the election in the United States is not dampening that from\nour perspective. As we're showing we're increasing our backlog and delivering on our metrics and then some.\nThere is one of the things on the customer side, what we're sensing is a real flight to quality for the Nextracker\nand that's we've articulated the value proposition of the company. We have a very differentiated tracker. Not all\ntrackers are architected the same. They don't operate the same. We have a very different tracker architecture that\nwe believe is superior and that our customers really appreciate. And then it extends from that to operations and\noperational excellence and the bankability of our company with a [ph] what Chuck (00:35:22) calls a fortress\nbalance sheet, very strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion liquidity as a company.\nAnd our -these projects are very expensive. They're – I mean, they're not – expensive [ph] is the wrong word\n(00:35:38). They require a lot of capital to finance and they produce the lowest cost form of energy with solar and\nthen some with solar and storage. But they require a lot of capital. And so, it's important for the tracker, which is\nthe backbone of the system to operate. And so all of these things feed our value proposition and what we believe\nis a flight [ph] to quality (00:36:05) differentially for Nextracker. Really appreciate the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nChristine Cho Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nGood evening. Thank you for taking the question. I thought maybe, I would hit on margins. So you guys are doing\nwell above the high-20s guidance. And I realize this is the full year guide and I know your mix shift, the US is\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nslightly higher than the two-thirds year-to-date. And I think your shareholder letter also talks about software\ncoming in better at 2%.\nBut other than that, is there anything else you would point to bridge the gap on, where in the cost structure you\nmight be doing better than you expected or alternatively, anything that should bring gross margins down in the\nback half of this year, other than the mix shift shifting back towards rest of world. And just lastly, when you say\nstructural gross margin, can you help us better understand what that definition is? Does that mean, where you\nthink gross margins will naturally settle out without any subsidies, whether it's explicit 45X credits or lower bill of\nmaterials offered instead of the explicit 45X credit.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nThank you, Christine. Chuck Boynton here. I appreciate your question. So first of all, Q1 and Q2 were incredibly\nstrong quarters, based on execution. And execution is really the key word. We over delivered based on our\nproduct teams, our customer service teams out in the field, delivering our projects on time with quality. And when\nyou that with great products deliver on time good things tend to happen, margins tend to be a lot better than you\nplan, when you deliver a great product on time, on schedule.\nThe second thing is, we've seen a really significant uptake in TrueCapture. TrueCapture is the best industry\nleading software that manages the power plant that drives the best [ph] sales (00:38:11) in the industry.\nTrueCapture has fairly high margins because of software and we saw a lot of systems being commissioned in Q2\nthat allowed us to really accelerate margins in Q2. That will probably not repeat in Q3 and Q4, it might, but our\nplan is it will be more like, 1% to 2%. It was higher than that in Q2. So the third factor is 45X, we had some\naccumulated 45X benefits from prior quarters that got amortized into Q2 and that will not repeat in the back half of\nthe year.\nIn the letter we talked about 300 basis points of overachievement in Q2 that are likely not to repeat in Q3 and Q4.\nAnd then Howard mentioned the international projects. In the first half, we had a really high share of US projects\nthat deliver really strong margins, great value for our customers. The back half of the year, we have some very\nlarge projects, especially in Q4 scheduled deliveries that are in very, very competitive markets. And that\neffectively averages out the company to effectively two-thirds, one-third international, our US mix. The structural\nmargin comment is really taking a step back, thinking about what is the business on an average, if you blend out\nthe model of two-thirds, one-third international on average, what would the margin profile look like? And we're\nsaying structurally it should be in the high-20s, maybe the low 30s. So that's a comment that the company has\nmade consistently and we've been over performing that based on really great execution. Thank you, Christine.\nNext question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBrian Lee Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nHey, guys. Thanks, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions I had. Just on the software piece, Chuck or Dan,\ncan you kind of speak to – I don't know, if you think about it, in terms of attach rate, but this the first time you\nbroke out the percent of sales, it seems like it could be an opportunity going forward. I remember you're talking to\nthis at the time of the IPO that was probably too small to break out. So just a sense of how you guys think about\nattach rate and then maybe if you can quantify kind of the margin uplift, I mean, compared to the high 20%\nstructural growth like where software coming in at? And in situations where you aren't able to get a customer to\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nsort of sign up for TrueCapture. What are some of the drivers there outside of maybe just the incremental cost?\nThanks guys.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThanks, Brian. So over the long-term, the attach rate of TrueCapture has increased significantly. This we first\nintroduced TrueCapture, which is an adaptive tracking software. About seven years ago, it's operating in all our\nmajor regions around the world. There are, to my knowledge, over 300 projects that have been commissioned\nwith TrueCapture. We work with all the leading independent engineers that value TrueCapture and TrueCapture\nhas been empirically validated in the field. What does that mean? That means we've gone out there and\nmeasured it and customers have become increasingly comfortable with TrueCapture. And so the – it's well\nunderstood. And as markets mature, we go into new, new markets or early markets as they mature TrueCapture\ntends to have an increasing attach rate as we go forward.\nOne of the things, we discussed during the IPO process around then is TrueCapture does have a different\nrevenue recognition model than our hardware business, where in the hardware business, revenue and profitability\nis recognized upon delivery. In the case of TrueCapture, the revenue recognition happens when the TrueCapture\nsystems are turned on. So then you have to – so there's a lag between hardware delivery and when systems are\ncommissioned and then TrueCapture is used.\nAnd so, as Chuck mentioned this last quarter, we saw more TrueCapture revenue, because it was building up, in\nterms of the systems were being shipped, but they weren't turned on yet, okay? So that's basically where it\nstands. We feel really great about the growth in the TrueCapture business globally, about the engagement by the\nindependent engineers. We keep releasing features, technology that increases TrueCapture's efficacy in the field.\nFor example, we released a feature called Zonal Diffuse and you can go on the Internet, on YouTube and look at\nthat. And we also released a feature called Split Boost, which is a highly differentiated feature that generates\nmore energy. So if you go on YouTube and type in Split Boost, Nextracker, you actually see how it works. These\nthings increase not only – well, they increase the amount of energy generated by TrueCapture. Thank you for\nyour question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nHey, Brian, I'll just add on the margin side, software is a little different animal, because you have – you tend to\nhave higher R&D costs. You spend a lot of money on the IP developing that technology. And so, the gross margin\nthat's reported, is very high, but it comes with OpEx in the R&D line. And you'll note this quarter we've increased\nour investment in R&D and we plan to increase our investment in R&D again in Q3 and Q4 and this is what's\ndriving this additional value. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dylan Nassano with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDylan Nassano Q\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n[indiscernible] (00:44:55) spoke on their earnings call last night. They're talking about shipping modules to\nwarehouses for customers who aren't yet ready to accept the product. I don't know, if you guys listen to that call,\nbut just two questions on that is, have you seen any impact on your projects in your backlog specifically from\nthose actions? And can you also just remind us what kind of recourse do you have when it comes to exercising\ncontractual delivery rights, should it be necessary? Thank you.\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nYeah. I'm sorry. Can you repeat who [ph] announce their shipping modules (00:45:24) to warehouses?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDylan Nassano Q\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC\nYeah. Sorry. It was First Solar. They were just talking about. Yeah, shipping directly to warehouses.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThis is Howard. I'll answer the question. My understanding is that was – it's fairly limited at least that's what we're\nsaying. I don't want to speak for First Solar. We're not seeing – we're seeing very consistent activity on a project-\nby-project basis. What that means is from quarter-to-quarter. We're seeing some project schedules shifting to the\nright, some project schedules being pulled in.\nAnd on the whole, because of our diversity, the number of EPCs that we work with, the number of owners and the\nnumber of projects that we have in the US and internationally, we're able to manage these flows back and forth in\ntotality. I think we've proven that over the last seven quarters since going public.\nBut we're not, we're not seeing on an individual project basis. We can see a delay or a shift of a month, six weeks,\nsometimes even longer. But it's not a very concerted trend. We're not seeing that, it's not going materially up into\nthe right relative to what we talked about last quarter. So we're actually seeing more stability, I would say, in our\nshipping schedules from last quarter to this quarter. Thanks for the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMaheep Mandloi Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So first just on the revenue cadence, I think in the [ph] news\nthat you've (00:47:33) pointed to flattish in Q3 [ph] so how this (00:47:35) Q4 weighted. So if you could just talk\nabout how many book and billings you still need to do for Q4 or the second half. And separately on the structural\nmargins or ratio of that. Could you just talk about the structuring OpEx, you expect. I think you talked about higher\nOpEx in Q3, Q4 for R&D. But how should we think about that going forward? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThis is Howard. I'll answer the first part of the question and Chuck will answer the second part about spending. So\nwe feel very solid about our FY 2025, because of our backlog and our visibility. So we're really, really good shape\nthere. There is – so that's, what I'll say. We've either hit or beat our top line, which is really driven by megawatt\nshipments each quarter. And we have a lot of confidence going into next quarter and for the year. And that\nincludes Q4, which is Dan and Chuck and our comments provide color on is it's going to – we expect a very\nrobust quarter and we're quite confident in delivering on the quarter. Chuck, you want to take the OpEx?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nI will. Thank you. And just to put context. Q4 will be the single biggest quarter in the company's history, and it's\ngoing to put a lot of pressure on our supply chain team. They are amazing and work to the challenge. But we\nhave booked and sold a lot of business and it's going to be a really, really strong Q4.\nOn the OpEx side, we're making really important strategic investments primarily in technology. We believe the\ncompany has a very big moat with our technology and we want to deepen and widen that moat with investments,\nkey investments in R&D. You saw in Q2, R&D spending went up by $3 million, SG&A was flat and we would\nintend in the back half of the year to continue to invest in R&D, as well as sales and go-to-market in key\ngeographies to drive revenue and sales for coming years.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJoseph Osha Q\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\nTurning to your 45X disclosure, I'd like to clarify the, the 300 basis point uplift that you referred to is sort of the\nincremental credit? It does not refer to the totality of the 45X uplift. Am I reading your language correctly?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nJoe, yes. Think of that the 300 basis points was the combination of TrueCapture 45X and other, which is, I would\ncall that great execution of our field teams. And so, 45X think of that as maybe a third of that the year, the year-\nover-year benefit. So just to be clear, Joe 45X was not in our prior year ago numbers. We had a cumulative catch\nup in Q4, as you might recall, that was GAAP only.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJoseph Osha Q\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nAnd so when you compare year-over-year for 45X. We want to just be super transparent and clear that they're not\npurely comparative. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Daiwa Capital Markets.

Great. Thank you for taking my question and I'll follow your instructions just limit myself to one. I'll add my\nkudos to the quarter, the results. Just wanted to ask about project cancellations. You had mentioned last quarter\nyou had a customer who had canceled out, it was a small customer. Just curious, you had anything like that this\nquarter.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S.

Thanks for your question. We have not had any projects cancel this quarter and the context of that one\nproject that canceled last quarter. The context was there were over – that was one out of over 500 projects. And\nso that's where we stand.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJonathan Kees Q\nAnalyst, Daiwa Capital Markets America, Inc.\nGreat.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S.

Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKashy Harrison Q\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler & Co.\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So my question is on NX\nFoundation. Just based on your analysis of your pipeline. I was wondering, if you could discuss what proportion of\nsites fall under the definition of hard terrain that would be applicable to Ojjo? And then do you have any US\nFoundation revenues hard terrain or otherwise in fiscal 2025? And then finally, when do you expect to start\nquantifying the foundation backlog? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nOkay. I'll take the first part of the question and then Chuck, you take the second part of the question, please.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nYes.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nWe had a fabulous launch event at RE+ plus of our foundations business. And we showed a map from the US\ngeological service that shows when bedrock is within one meter of the surface is my recollection of what the, the\nmetric was. And it turns out, there's a significant portion just geographically of the US that has rock, near the\nsurface, where if you were putting a traditional pile on the ground, you would hit rock. And what we've also seen is\nover the years, as the solar market has broadened geographically across the US, a greater prevalence of the\nnumber of sites that have rock that have to be addressed or other it's not just rock, but also difficult soils such as\nfrosty soils, expansive clay soils or swampy site type soils. And the two foundation technologies required to\naddress all the above.\nIn terms of numbers we covered in that forum, there were numbers like 20% to 30-plus percent of the sites are\ndifficult sites. Some of our customers have over half their sites depending on their geographic range of activity.\nSo, it's very significant. That's the answer to the first part of the question. Chuck, in terms of the second yeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nYeah. Kashy, thank you for the question. In Q2, we actually booked and reported revenue for our new foundations\nbusiness. So we're super thrilled that we have customers paying us money for this technology. We have booked\nnew transactions. We don't expect the dollars to be significant this year. And I'd say stay tuned for Analyst Day\nand our views on next year will be, we'll provide more color as we think about, talking about next fiscal year.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Windham with UBS. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJon Windham Q\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC\nPerfect. I appreciate you taking some time to do the questions. Congratulations on 100% US domestic content\ncapabilities. As you plan to ramp and ship that next year. Just wondering, if you could give us some thoughts or\nguidepost about what proportion of your US business is that likely to be? Appreciate it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThanks, Jon. And just as a point of clarification, we actually have our first 100% US tracker scheduled for delivery\nthis quarter. So we were able to accelerate that based on customer demand. With respect to the percentage of\nour business next year that could use the 100% domestic tracker, we're going to have to wait and see on that and\nspeak to it later. It comes a bit to customer needs. It, it also relates to their module, their module mix. But what\nwe're working on is from a supply chain standpoint, getting ahead of the curve. And that's consistent with how\nNextracker massively ramped our US business prior to Build Back Better, prior to IRA, we were ramping our US\nsupply chain and we've ramped it in other key markets such as India.\nThis quarter in India, we announced we've hit – 95% content, for example, in India with over 10 gigs of capacity in\nIndia, for India and in the US, over 30 gigs of our major components in the US for the US. We are seeing\ncontinued demand and stronger demand than we anticipated for this 100% US content tracker. We'll have to wait\nand see before we guide to that number. Well, we could address that potentially on our subsequent or the\nfollowing earnings call or the Analyst Day that Chuck mentioned. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo Q\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nHey, guys. Just [ph] go to the (00:58:08) international opportunity is so big. And the US opportunity is better\nmargins. What do you guys optimize for sales growth or margin or EPS growth or cash flow?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nHey, Ben, we're optimized. We want to grow. We want to keep growing. And we want to do so responsibly and\nthat's, and that means profitably in an accretive way. So if we go into a new region, we evaluate, is accretive to\nthe company, it's sort of like an M&A. And so, we see it your way, which is, there is a vast international\nopportunity in addition to the US market. I personally just came back from India, I spent a week there. The – they\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nhave a 500 gigawatt target for renewables by 2030. That translates to 50 gigawatts per year just for India. And\nthat goal is more than a goal. It's really like an [ph] RPS (00:59:19).\nThe states are required to comply to get this thing up to meet this clean power goal. But they don't, they don't\nreceive funding. That's our understanding from this trip. So there is this movement worldwide happening on\nelectrification and clean energy. And so we are going to – we tapping into that and we're going to keep doing that\nresponsibly. Thanks for your question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jordan Levy with Truist. Your line is now open.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJordan Levy Q\nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.\nGood afternoon all. Thanks for all the commentary. I think, Chuck, in an earlier comment, in the earlier question,\nyou talked to the efforts on the R&D side around expansion into new technologies and also into new markets. I\njust wanted to see if we could – not to get into too many specifics, but any additional color we could get there on\nwhat sort of opportunities are attractive to you?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nYeah. So the question is, what new R&D efforts are we taking on? And Dan maybe you should take that question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nSure. Hey, Jordan, thank you. Jordan, I think the best way to think about this is, if you look at our patents, we\nhave over 600 patents issued and pending in three categories mechanical, electronic controls and software. And\nso, we're continuing – and these relate to each other. They're not silos, the mechanical relates to the control\nsystem, which relates to the software. For example in TrueCapture and these really add value for customers. So\nwe're really continuing to invest in all of these categories and what we have is a very well evolved process to look\nat where – we look at innovation and then how much value does it contribute to customer?\nCan that value be quantified and monetized by the customer? What's the incremental investment and what's the\nrisk and what's the timeframe? These are the factors that go in and that we have a list based on the available\nbudget we have. And then we're investing in everything that we can afford and we've continued to increase that\nbudget and we've just seen a really great efficacy. And one of the things we speak about is, as we release these\ntechnologies, they've been piloted in the field. And so, it's great. We've got our Hail Pro-75 out there operating\nwith customers in real utility-scale power plants and so forth. So, it's been, it's been very productive. Now having\nsaid that, we've also acquired technology. We're open to that. We do – we're very open to looking at technologies\nthat can be additive to the company, I believe we have time for one more question. And operator.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nOperator, we're ready for the next question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Your line is now open.\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nNextracker, Inc.\n(NXT) Corrected Transcript\nQ2 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith Q\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\nHey, guys, can you hear me okay?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar A\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nCrystal Julian.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith Q\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\nAwesome. Hey, sorry about that. I wasn't sure if it was coming through earlier. Hey, I appreciate the time. Just to\nfollow-up earlier on the US content, how many points you [ph] qualifying for into the (01:03:02) domestic\ncontents? Just to clarify 100% product? And then just coming back to the margin question quickly here. Obviously\nfirst half versus back half, as you think about that exit run rate in the back half here. Is that kind of what you\nshould be thinking about in terms of the EBITDA margin going forward for the remainder of that backlog or is the\nfirst half of this year really kind of a good indicator what you can put up, as you think about embedded in that\nbacklog across the $4.5 billion?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nHoward J. Wenger A\nPresident & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nThank you, Julian. This is Howard. I'll answer the first part. Chuck the second. So on the domestic content, really\nhappy to be able to deliver that this quarter. For our customers, we're seeing a higher take up than we anticipated\nfor that. Why? In large part, because we are now enable that customer qualify for 24.7 points out of 100.\nSo a quarter of four, the 40% or 45% that's required, okay? So if you need – and that's increasing over time. So if\nyou need 40 or 45 points, we're more than half of the points to get to a 10% credit. So we're seeing customers\nreally interested in that, they're thinking about okay, tracker plus, how much, panel domestic panels do they need\nto achieve that hurdle? So that's the answer to the first part of your question. Chuck?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nCharles D. Boynton A\nChief Financial Officer, Nextracker, Inc.\nYeah, Julian, we're not going to sort of do our outlook for next year and beyond today. But a lot of the factors,\nthese structural kind of high-20s, maybe low-30s gross margins would translate into, call it 20-ish EBITDA\nmargins. It's too early right now to see what that's going to look like next year, because there's a lot of factors,\nmix, attach rates of TrueCapture, our new foundations businesses. And it's more appropriate to talk about that at\nour Analyst Day or at our Q4 earnings call, as we roll out the outlook for next year. Dan, do you want to close?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDaniel S. Shugar\nChief Executive Officer, Founder & Director, Nextracker, Inc.\nYes. First, thank you, everyone, joining our earnings call.
