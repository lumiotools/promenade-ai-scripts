More than a refreshed look and feel, this rebrand signals the next chapter in 8x8’s CX transformation driven by a clear purpose: _To connect people and organizations through seamless communication, empowering them to unlock the potential of every interaction._\n\n**CX Limits Were Meant to be Shattered**\n\n“At 8x8, we’re stepping out of the box and our new brand captures the energy and ambition of this exciting next stage. Our transformation is much more than cosmetic, it’s a commitment to relentless innovation and a giant leap in the CX space as we align 8x8 even further around our customers’ successes by taking their CX goals and ambitions to new heights,” said Bruno Bertini, Chief Marketing Officer at 8x8, Inc. ”Brands, much like technology, must evolve to stay relevant in a rapidly changing world. Today, the CX landscape has evolved to include every employee in customer-facing roles, as digital transformation, mobile-first strategies, and AI reshape how organizations interact with customers. Expectations have never been higher and organizations need to partner with a forward-looking vendor to help them take CX to the next level and elevate their business.” \n\n**CX and IT Leaders are the Heroes of Transformation**\n\nThe force behind every customer experience are CX and IT Leaders—part strategist, part problem-solver, and part innovator.

By integrating contact center, unified communications, CPaaS APIs, AI, Microsoft Teams and 8x8 Technology Partner Ecosystem solutions into one platform and eliminating data silos across these solutions, customers can stretch and empower every employee across the organization, turning every team into a customer facing team and every customer interaction into fully integrated journeys. \n\nIn an overhyped space where it’s all about the shiny new next feature and the next buzzword, 8x8 believes organizations need not only the best technology but more to be successful.

On August 5, 2024, the Company used the proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan, plus approximately $29 million from existing cash balances, to fund the early repayment of the entire $225 million outstanding, plus accrued interest and fees, on the existing term loan with Francisco Partners. \n  * Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Company retired another $33 million of principal value of the term loan debt, reducing total debt principal balance to $369 million as of November 1, 2024. This represents a total debt reduction of over $173 million, or 32%, over the past two years. \n  * Extended the scope of the ISO 140001 Environmental Management System to the Company's Paris office and French operations. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter and Updated Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Outlook:**\n\nManagement provides expected ranges for total revenue, service revenue and non-GAAP operating margin based on its evaluation of the current business environment. The Company emphasizes that these expectations are subject to various important cautionary factors referenced in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. \n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Ending December 31, 2024**\n\n  * Service revenue in the range of $171 million to $174 million. \n  * Total revenue in the range of $177 million to $182 million. \n  * Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of approximately 10% to 11%. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal Year 2025 Ending March 31, 2025**\n\n  * Service revenue in the range of $690 million to $701 million. \n  * Total revenue in the range of $714 million to $727 million. \n  * Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 10.25% to 11%. \n\n\n\nThe Company does not reconcile its forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measure of GAAP operating margin due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses excluded by this metric. For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure are not available without unreasonable effort. See the \"Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin. \n\nAll projections are on a non-GAAP basis. Additionally, our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we don't anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome. \n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss earnings results on November 4, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

Any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"strategy,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: changing industry trends; the size of our market opportunity; the potential success and impact of our investments in innovation and artificial intelligence technologies; our strategic transformation initiatives; our ability to increase profitability and cash flow to deleverage our balance sheet and fund investment in innovation; whether our unified communication and contact center traffic will increase; whether we can increase customer retention; our future revenue and growth (including platform usage revenue); whether we can sustain an increasing pace of innovation; the success of our go-to-market engine; our ability to improve general and administrative synergies; our ability to enhance shareholder value; and our financial outlook, revenue growth, and profitability, including whether we will achieve sustainable growth and profitability. \n\nYou should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: a reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenues and our business; customer adoption and demand for our products may be lower than we anticipate; the impact of economic downturns on us and our customers; ongoing volatility and conflict in the political environment, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and war in the Middle East; inflationary pressures and rising interest rates; competitive dynamics of the cloud communication and collaboration markets, including voice, contact center, video, messaging, and communication application programming interfaces, in which we compete may change in ways we are not anticipating; third parties may assert ownership rights in our IP, which may limit or prevent our continued use of the core technologies behind our solutions; our customer churn rate may be higher than we anticipate; our investments in marketing, channel and value-added resellers, new products, and our acquisition of Fuze, Inc. may not result in meeting our revenue or operating margin targets we forecast in our guidance, for a particular quarter or for the full fiscal year. Our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we do not anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome. \n\nFor a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other reports that 8x8, Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and 8x8, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law, even as new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. \n\n**Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation**\n\nThe Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8’s investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's ongoing \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company’s core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends. \n\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: \n\n_Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue_\n\nNon-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs. \n\n_Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin_\n\nNon-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company’s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company’s Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends. \n\n_Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin_\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. \n\n_Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, loss on debt extinguishment, gain on remeasurement of warrants, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company’s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends. \n\n_Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share – Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted_\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income Per Share – Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share – Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8’s underlying business performance. Management believes the Company’s investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company’s diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends. \n\nManagement evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be “core costs” or “core proceeds.” Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company’s operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts.
