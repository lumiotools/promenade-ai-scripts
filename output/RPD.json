As a [launch partner](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hKgVtulc7rhkFV9G5AJDlKSc7aaXAYUcZLQrfQfpfCHcEG4q3e_MOGHSEYAXpm5T50tBuxHLCKVhjcXJNjBbJpAGnsC_Gv427oP0lUtz4Ebmk-2OysNxbATlYBA4Csv2f2hE27wAJPzqvOLRFX3ec-GpJGoS2Mb98O-ObstVZpGQM-LTZqILKKhDuiiIOtfzCpHP2pM0yrw_RNNyEmeq8A==) for this powerful feature, Rapid7 now provides additional visibility, insights, and best practices that guide customers in addressing complex enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) challenges across the modern attack surface.\n\nAs businesses rapidly scale their AWS environments, they need additional visibility and tighter security controls in managing proliferating identities, resources, and their corresponding permissions. RCPs facilitate this by giving AWS customers more granular control over access at the resource level. Rapid7's Exposure Command empowers organizations to implement a zero-trust approach that seamlessly integrates with their existing AWS cloud infrastructure, including AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs), which set permissions at the principal level. Through the addition of RCP support, Rapid7 enables customers to achieve a higher level of control, ensuring that resources and data remain protected, even as environments scale rapidly.\n\n“We’re proud to partner with AWS for their RCP launch, as we believe it underscores our organizations’ shared commitment to advancing cloud security,” said Craig Adams, chief product officer at Rapid7. “Now, our combined support for RCPs and SCPs in Exposure Command significantly reduces identity-based risk for our customers, ensuring they have the tools needed to enforce zero-trust policies, manage cloud permissions, and confidently drive innovation at scale.”\n\n[Exposure Command](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z8Wlj_ejqKg0HCx33CV-YSjlh_qVSso7CKmViPRE6S-htj2UZkXru__K8CCGY7dVPua4XV8nOYINrbYGiIS6JQugqAZh9szQcBAHwqoaideXiiOVAErtCrIWfOZ2ANpzBu3N5ll4EPa9_drqg-FA6g==) combines the power of 360-degree attack surface visibility with high-fidelity context enrichment, aggregating findings from Rapid7’s native exposure detection capabilities as well as third-party enrichment sources from customers’ existing technology ecosystem. This situational awareness enables teams to quickly zero in on the exposures attackers have in their sights, with the threat-aware risk context needed to assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities more efficiently and effectively.\n\n**Key Benefits of Exposure Command’s New RCP Support:**\n\n  * **Centralized RCP Monitoring and Governance** : Exposure Command offers a single, unified view of RCP usage, making it easy for security teams to monitor and manage policies across their AWS environments.\n  * **Enhanced Identity and Access Controls** : RCP support extends Rapid7’s existing identity analysis capabilities, allowing organizations to automatically refine permissions organization-wide, prevent excessive access, and enforce least-privilege access (LPA) across AWS resources.\n  * **Proactive Best Practice Recommendations** : Rapid7 provides expert guidance on implementing RCPs effectively, enabling customers to align security controls with business objectives and regulatory requirements.\n  * **Comprehensive AWS Coverage** : In addition to RCPs and SCPs, Exposure Command offers a wide range of tools to protect AWS resources, including automated scanning and identification of vulnerabilities; real-time threat alerts for suspicious activities; and visibility and protection for AI and machine learning resources.\n\n\n\nAs cloud adoption continues to grow, Rapid7 remains committed to delivering the tools and insights organizations need to reduce risk, maintain compliance, and innovate securely alongside AWS.

The first two solutions on the Command Platform are Exposure Command, which helps\norganizations detect and prioritize exposures from endpoint to cloud, and Surface Command, for discovery and deep\nvisibility into the assets across customers’ internal and external attack surface.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Guidance\nRapid7 anticipates annualized recurring revenue, revenue, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income per share\nand free cash flow to be in the following ranges:\nFourth Quarter 2024 Full-Year 2024\n(in millions, except per share data)\nAnnualized recurring revenue $835 to $845\nYear-over-year growth 4% to 5%\nRevenue $211 to $213 $839 to $841\nYear-over-year growth 3% to 4% 8%\nNon-GAAP income from operations $33 to $35 $157 to $159\nNon-GAAP net income per share $0.48 to $0.51 $2.28 to $2.31\nWeighted average shares outstanding 75.7 74.7\nFree cash flow $145 to $155\nThe guidance provided above is forward-looking in nature.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures and other metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past\nfinancial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management\nin its financial and operational decision-making.\nWhile our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating\nour own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate\nour business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-\nGAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We also disclose non-GAAP gross\nmargin and non-GAAP operating margin derived from these financial measures.\nWe define non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per\nshare as the respective GAAP balances excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired\nintangible assets, amortization of debt issuance costs and certain other items such as acquisition-related expenses, impairment of\nlong-lived assets, change in the fair value of derivative assets, restructuring expense and discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net\nincome per basic and diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares used to compute\nnet income per share, with the number of weighted average shares decreased, when applicable, to reflect the anti-dilutive impact\nof the capped call transactions entered into in connection with our convertible senior notes.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing our operating performance due to the\nfollowing factors:\nStock-based compensation expense. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation\nmethodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe\nthat providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows for more meaningful\ncomparisons between our operating results from period to period.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe that excluding the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets\nallows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period as the intangible assets are valued at\nthe time of acquisition and are amortized over several years after the acquisition.\nAcquisition-related expenses. We exclude acquisition-related expenses as costs that are unrelated to the current operations and\nare neither comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future results.\nAmortization of debt issuance costs. The expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior\nnotes and revolving credit facility is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense provides a more useful\ncomparison of our operational performance in different periods.\nInduced conversion expense. In conjunction with the third quarter of 2023 partial repurchase of our 2025 Notes, we incurred a\nnon-cash induced conversion expense of $53.9 million. We exclude induced conversion expense because this amount is not\nindicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business and neither is comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future\nresults.\nrapid7.com\nChange in fair value of derivative assets. The change in fair value of derivative assets related to our capped calls settlement is a\nnon-cash item and we believe the exclusion of this other income (expense) provides a more useful comparison of our operational\nperformance in different periods.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets consists of impairment charges allocated to the carrying amount\nof certain operating right-of-use assets and the associated leasehold improvements when the carrying amounts exceed their\nrespective fair values and we believe the exclusion of the impairment charges provides a more useful comparison of our\noperational performance in different periods.\nRestructuring expense. We exclude non-ordinary course restructuring expenses related to our restructuring plan we announced in\nAugust 2023, which was concluded in the three months ended March 31, 2024, because we do not believe these charges are\nindicative of our core operating performance and we believe the exclusion of the restructuring expenses provides a more useful\ncomparison of our performance in different periods.\nDiscrete tax items. We exclude certain discrete tax items such as income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing\nbusiness operations in the current year and adjustments to uncertain tax position reserves as these charges are not indicative of\nour ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results.\nAnti-dilutive impact of capped call transaction. Our capped calls transactions are intended to offset potential dilution from the\nconversion features in our convertible senior notes. Although we cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call\ntransactions under GAAP, we do reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions in non-GAAP net income (loss)\nper diluted share, when applicable, to provide investors with useful information in evaluating our financial performance on a per\nshare basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that we define as net income (loss) before (1) interest income, (2)\ninterest expense, (3) other (income) expense, net, (4) provision for income taxes, (5) depreciation expense, (6) amortization of\nintangible assets, (7) stock-based compensation expense, (8) acquisition-related expenses, (9) impairment of long-lived assets\nand (10) restructuring expense. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial\nstatements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business\nperformance across companies and across periods.\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that we define as cash provided by operating activities less purchases\nof property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure\nthat provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary\ncapital expenditures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies\nin our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to\nnon-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by\nother companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based\ncompensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business\nand an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nOther Metrics\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”). ARR is defined as the annual value of all recurring revenue related contracts in place at\nthe end of the period. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and\nis not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by\ncontract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue reported as professional services revenue in our\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nNumber of Customers. We define a customer as any entity that has an active Rapid7 recurring revenue contract as of the specified\nmeasurement date, excluding InsightOps and Logentries only customers with a contract value less than $2,400 per year.\nARR per Customer. We define ARR per customer as ARR divided by the number of customers at the end of the period.\nrapid7.com\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.

          "content": "Company Overview\nNovember 6, 2024\n1\nDisclaimers\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this presentation other than statements of historical facts, including, without limitation, statements\nregarding our market opportunity, demand for our product and service offerings, expectations regarding our annualized recurring revenue (ARR), free cash flow, and our other\nnon-GAAP measures, our business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations and expectations regarding non-GAAP targets, our future financial and business performance\nfor the fourth quarter and full-year 2024, and the assumptions underlying such guidance, are forward-looking statements. Our use of the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The events described in our forward-looking statements are\nsubject to a number of risks and uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results\nexpressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Risks that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, growing macroeconomic uncertainty,\nunstable market and economic conditions, fluctuations in our quarterly results, effectiveness of our restructuring plan, failure to meet our publicly announced guidance or other\nexpectations about our business, our ability to sustain our revenue growth rate, the ability of our products and professional services to correctly detect vulnerabilities, competition in the\nmarkets in which we operate, market growth, our ability to innovate and manage our growth, our ability to integrate acquired companies, actions by activist stockholders, exposure to\ngreater than anticipated tax liability, our ability to operate in compliance with applicable laws as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of our most\nrecent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 7, 2024 and May 8, 2024, and our most recent Annual Report on Form\n10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 and in the subsequent reports that we file with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.\nNew risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any\nfactor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we may make. Except as required by law, we\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. You should, therefore, not rely on these\nforward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this presentation.\nThis presentation also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other data about our industry. This\ndata involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. Neither we nor any other person makes any representation\nas to the accuracy or completeness of such data or undertakes any obligation to update such data after the date of this presentation. In addition, projections, assumptions and\nestimates of our future performance and the future performance of the markets in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\nThis presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or\nsuperior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus\ntheir nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of\nwhich could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Please refer to our November 6, 2024 press release for additional information as to\nwhy we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing our operating results. As required by Regulation G, we have provided a\nreconciliation of those measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is available in the end notes to this presentation. However, the reconciliation of non-GAAP\nguidance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures does not reflect any items that are unknown at this time, such as non-ordinary course litigation-related expenses, which\nwe are not able to predict without unreasonable effort due to their inherent uncertainty.\n2\nRapid7 Overview\nFINANCIAL SCALE GLOBAL SCOPE\n$54bn+ 11k+\nMASSIVE Opportunity to\nConsolidate SecOps Total Addressable Global Customers\nMarket\n300T+ 28M\nSubStANTIAL RECURRING\n$800m+\nEvents Collected Automation\nREVENUE BASE & Analyzed by Workflows\nARR R7 Threat Engine\n500+ 60+\n$150m\nRAMPING CASH FLOW\nPlatform Integrations Patents Granted and\nFree Cash Flow Target\nfor Connectivity Pending Related to AI\nin 20241\n1Based on FY 2024 guidance provided as of November 6, 2024.

ARR should be viewed\nindependently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future\nrevenue and can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates, and does not include revenue reported as professional services revenue in our consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nRecurring Revenue\n• Recurring revenue is defined as revenue from the sale of term software licenses, content subscriptions, managed services, cloud-based subscriptions and maintenance and\nsupport calculated as % of total revenue.\nCustomer\n• A Customer is defined as any entity that has an active recurring revenue contract as of the specified measurement date, excluding InsightOps and Logentries only customers\nwith a contract value less than $2,400 per year.\nARR per Customer\n• ARR per Customer is defined as ARR divided by the number of Customers at the end of the period.\nNon-GAAP metrics\n• Non-GAAP gross margins represent the GAAP gross profit, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets calculated as a % of\nrevenue. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation.\n• Operating expenses and operating income margin presented are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible\nassets, and certain other items such as acquisition-related expenses and litigation-related expenses.\n• Free cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by operations less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software costs.\nGuidance\n• Guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 does not include any potential impact of foreign exchange gains or losses.\n• Non-GAAP guidance excludes estimates for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt issuance costs and certain\nother items such as restructuring expense and discrete tax items. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided in the\nfinancial statement tables included in these End Notes. The reconciliation does not reflect any items that are unknown at this time, such as non-ordinary course\nlitigation-related expenses, for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024, which we are not able to predict without unreasonable effort due to their inherent uncertainty.\n25\nThank You\n26"
