(\"Aviat Networks,\" \"Aviat,\" or the \"Company\"), (Nasdaq: AVNW), the leading expert in wireless transport and access solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n[ ![Aviat Networks, Inc.

North America revenue of $42.2 million decreased by $(12.6) million or (23.0)%, compared to $54.9 million in the prior year due lower tier 1 demand and timing of certain private network projects. International revenue of $46.2 million increased by $14.1 million or 44.1%, compared to $32.1 million in the prior year. This growth was due to the addition from the Pasolink acquisition.\n\n**_Gross Margins_**\n\nIn the fiscal 2025 first quarter, the Company reported GAAP gross margin of 22.4% and non-GAAP gross margin of 23.2%. This compares to GAAP gross margin of 35.9% and non-GAAP gross margin of 36.2% in the fiscal 2024 first quarter, a decrease of (1,350) and (1,300) basis points, respectively. The decrease was driven by mix shift away from higher margin projects and regions in the quarter.\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nThe Company reported GAAP total operating expenses of $35.4 million for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, compared to $26.3 million in the fiscal 2024 first quarter, an increase of $9.1 million or 34.4%. Non-GAAP total operating expenses, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, share-based compensation, and merger and acquisition expenses for the fiscal 2025 first quarter were $30.0 million, compared to $23.9 million in the prior year, an increase of $6.2 million or 25.8%.\n\n**_Operating Income_**\n\nThe Company reported GAAP operating loss of $(15.6) million for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, compared to a GAAP operating income of $4.9 million in the fiscal 2024 first quarter, a decrease of $(20.5) million. Operating income decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses as a result of the Pasolink and 4RF transactions. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported operating loss of $(9.5) million for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $7.6 million in the prior year, a decrease of $(17.1) million.\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe Company reported GAAP income tax benefit of $(5.5) million in the fiscal 2025 first quarter, compared to a GAAP income tax expense of $0.4 million in the fiscal 2024 first quarter.\n\n**_Net Income / Net Income Per Share_**\n\nThe Company reported GAAP net loss of $(11.9) million in the fiscal 2025 first quarter or GAAP net loss per share of $(0.94). This compared to GAAP net income of $3.6 million or GAAP net income per share of $0.30 in the fiscal 2024 first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported net loss of $(11.1) million or non-GAAP net income per share of $(0.87), compared to non-GAAP net income of $7.2 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") for the fiscal 2025 first quarter was $(7.7) million, compared to $8.9 million in the fiscal 2024 first quarter, a decrease of $(16.6) million.\n\n**_Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\nThe Company reported $51.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 27, 2024, compared to $64.6 million as of June 28, 2024. As of September 27, 2024, total debt was $83.4 million, an increase of $35.0 million from June 28, 2024.\n\n**_Fiscal 2025 Full Year Outlook_**\n\nThe Company is updating its fiscal 2025 full year guidance as follows:\n\n  * Full year Revenue between $430 and $470 million\n  * Full year Adjusted EBITDA between $30.0 and $40.0 million\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Details_**\n\nAviat Networks will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) today, November 5, 2024, to discuss its financial and operational results for the fiscal 2025 first quarter ended September 27, 2024.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. We also believe these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in our business and to understand our performance. In addition, we may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as a guide in our forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning process and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP follow.  \n1We have not reconciled Adjusted EBITDA guidance to its corresponding GAAP measure due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections, particularly with respect to merger and acquisition costs and share-based compensation. In particular, share-based compensation expense is affected by future hiring, turnover, and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to change. Accordingly, reconciliations of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA are not available without unreasonable effort.  \n  \n**Table 3** **AVIAT NETWORKS, INC.** **Fiscal Year 2025 First Quarter Summary** **RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(1)** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 27 , 2024** |  **% of** **Revenue** |  September 29, 2023 |  % of Revenue  \n(In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts)  \n**GAAP gross margin** |  **$ 19,788** |  **22.4 %** |  $ 31,195 |  35.9 %  \nShare-based compensation |  **104** |  183  \nMerger and acquisition and other expenses |  **608** |  43  \n**Non-GAAP gross margin** |  **20,500** |  **23.2 %** |  31,421 |  36.2 %  \n**GAAP research and development expenses** |  **$ 10,408** |  **11.8 %** |  $ 6,424 |  7.4 %  \nShare-based compensation |  **(143)** |  (146)  \n**Non-GAAP research and development expenses** |  **10,265** |  **11.6 %** |  6,278 |  7.2 %  \n**GAAP selling and administrative expenses** |  **$ 24,948** |  **28.2 %** |  $ 19,237 |  22.1 %  \nShare-based compensation |  **(1,417)** |  (1,505)  \nMerger and acquisition and other expenses |  **(3,781)** |  (146)  \n**Non-GAAP selling and administrative expenses** |  **19,750** |  **22.3 %** |  17,586 |  20.2 %  \n**GAAP operating (loss) income** |  **$ (15,568)** |  **(17.6) %** |  $ 4,890 |  5.6 %  \nShare-based compensation |  **1,664** |  1,834  \nMerger and acquisition and other expenses |  **4,389** |  189  \nRestructuring charges |  **—** |  644  \n**Non-GAAP operating (loss) income** |  **(9,515)** |  **(10.8) %** |  7,557 |  8.7 %  \n**GAAP income tax (benefit) provision** |  **$ (5,514)** |  **(6.2) %** |  $ 432 |  0.5 %  \nAdjustment to reflect pro forma tax rate |  **6,014** |  (132)  \n**Non-GAAP income tax provision** |  **500** |  **0.6 %** |  300 |  0.3 %  \n**GAAP net (loss) income** |  **$ (11,879)** |  **(13.4) %** |  $ 3,557 |  4.1 %  \nShare-based compensation |  **1,664** |  1,834  \nMerger and acquisition and other expenses |  **4,389** |  189  \nRestructuring charges |  **—** |  644  \nOther expense, net |  **710** |  802  \nAdjustment to reflect pro forma tax rate |  **(6,014)** |  132  \n**Non-GAAP net (loss) income** |  **$ (11,130)** |  **(12.6) %** |  $ 7,158 |  8.2 %  \n**Diluted net (loss) income per share:**  \nGAAP |  **$ (0.94)** |  $ 0.30  \nNon-GAAP |  **$ (0.87)** |  $ 0.60  \n**Shares used in computing diluted net (loss) income per share**  \nGAAP |  **12,646** |  11,943  \nNon-GAAP |  **12,804** |  11,943  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA:_**  \n**GAAP net (loss) income** |  **$ (11,879)** |  **(13.4) %** |  $ 3,557 |  4.1 %  \nDepreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets |  **1,830** |  1,344  \nInterest expense, net |  **1,115** |  99  \nOther expense, net |  **710** |  802  \nShare-based compensation |  **1,664** |  1,834  \nMerger and acquisition and other expenses |  **4,389** |  189  \nRestructuring charges |  **—** |  644  \n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes |  **(5,514)** |  432  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$ (7,685)** |  **(8.7) %** |  $ 8,901 |  10.2 %  \n  \n(1) |  The adjustments above reconcile our GAAP financial results to the non-GAAP financial measures used by us. Our non-GAAP net income excluded share-based compensation, and other non-recurring charges (recovery). Adjusted EBITDA was determined by excluding depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment, interest, provision for or benefit from income taxes, and non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments, as set forth above, from GAAP net income. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP items provides meaningful supplemental information to investors, when viewed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, our GAAP results. However, the non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Table 4** **AVIAT NETWORKS, INC.** **Fiscal Year 2025 First Quarter Summary** **SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 27 ,****2024** |  September 29,2023  \n(In thousands)  \n**North America** |  **$ 42,225** |  $ 54,853  \n**International:**  \nAfrica and the Middle East |  **10,450** |  9,954  \nEurope |  **5,600** |  5,252  \nLatin America and Asia Pacific |  **30,154** |  16,850  \n**Total international** |  **46,204** |  32,056  \n**Total revenue** |  **$ 88,429** |  $ 86,909  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=FL48734&sd=2024-11-05) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aviat-networks-announces-fiscal-2025-first-quarter-and-three-month-financial-results-302296829.html>\n\nSOURCE Aviat Networks, Inc.\n\n  * [ Printed Materials ](/investor-resources/printed-materials)\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/investor-resources/email-alerts)\n  * [ Download Library ](/investor-resources/download-library)\n  * [ RSS News Feeds ](/investor-resources/rss-news-feeds)\n  * [ Search ](/search)\n\n\n"
