(“we,” “us,” “our,” “Cue” or the “Company”) and is made for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to\nsell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to\nregistration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. The information set forth herein does not purport to be complete or to contain all of the\ninformation you may desire. Statements contained herein are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise, and neither this presentation, nor any sale of securities,\nshall under any circumstances create an implication that the information contained herein is correct as of any time after such date or that information will be updated or revised to reflect\ninformation that subsequently becomes available or changes occurring after the date hereof.\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our\nfuture plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “seek,”\n“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “strategy,” “future, “vision”, “likely” or other comparable terms, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\nidentifying words. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this presentation regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and\nobjectives are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding our development plans for CUE-101 and the\ncontinued buildout of our pipeline, the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to support the clinical development of CUE-101, anticipated results of our drug\ndevelopment efforts, including study results, our expectations regarding the timing of milestone events, regulatory developments and expected future operating results. Forward-looking\nstatements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of\nour business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future,\nthey are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial\ncondition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that\ncould cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, our limited operating history,\nlimited cash and a history of losses; our ability to achieve profitability; potential setbacks in our research and development efforts including negative or inconclusive results from our\npreclinical studies, our ability to secure required U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other governmental approvals for our product candidates and the breadth of any approved\nindication; adverse effects caused by public health pandemics, including COVID-19, including possible effects on our operations and clinical trials; negative or inconclusive results from\nour clinical studies or serious and unexpected drug-related side effects or other safety issues experienced by participants in our clinical trials; delays and changes in regulatory\nrequirements, policy and guidelines including potential delays in submitting required regulatory applications to the FDA; our reliance on licensors, collaborators, contract research\norganizations, suppliers and other business partners; our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our business operations in the future; our ability to maintain and enforce necessary\npatent and other intellectual property protection, competitive factors, general economic and market conditions; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors and in\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed\nQuarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q.

Importantly, we have made measurable progress advancing\nour clinical programs that further supports the therapeutic potential of our differentiated Immuno-STAT™\nplatform for treating cancer. To date, the data from our ongoing clinical trials with CUE-101 for the treatment\nof human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M\nHNSCC) and CUE-102 for treating Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1) over-expressing cancers, such as colorectal, ovarian,\npancreatic and gastric cancers, bolsters our belief that we have developed a well-tolerated approach for\nselective modulation of cancer relevant T cells.\nAdditionally, we have made substantial preclinical progress for the treatment of autoimmune disease on two\nkey fronts: (i) in collaboration with our partner Ono Pharmaceuticals, we have continued to develop CUE-401\ntoward a lead candidate for selective induction and expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs); and (ii) building\nupon the derisking and validation of Immuno-STATs via our oncology programs, we have developed a new\nseries, termed CUE-500, that is designed to selectively harness the protective anti-viral T cells to deplete B\ncells in autoimmune diseases. We believe CUE-500 may provide a biologic alternative to achieve CAR-T-like\nefficacy recently reported in third-party clinical data for the treatment of autoimmunity.\nDuring the start of 2024, we completed a Type B meeting with the FDA receiving guidance on potential paths\nfor CUE-101 registrational trials in both the monotherapy and combination settings. Through careful\nassessment and evaluation of the options available for second line plus (2L+) monotherapy and/or first line\n(1L) in combination with standard of care, KEYTRUDA®, we elected to design a randomized Phase 2 trial in 1L\ncombination with KEYTRUDA as we believe that would be the most attractive opportunity for potential\nregistration, considering projected market size and complementary mechanism of actions. The composite\nCUE-101 clinical data continue to strengthen and have demonstrated a greater than doubling of the overall\nresponse rate (ORR) of 46% with CUE-101 + KEYTRUDA compared to historic ORR of 19% with KEYTRUDA\nalone in a third-party trial. Furthermore, we have observed to date a greater than doubling of the median\nprogression free survival (mPFS) of 8.3 months with CUE-101 + KEYTRUDA compared to historic mPFS of 3.2\nmonths with KEYTRUDA alone in a third-party trial.\nThese observations support our premise that CUE-101, and by implication, CUE-102, as well as the entire\nCUE-100 series, mechanistically complement immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) such as KEYTRUDA. We see\nthis as a key strategic advantage for potentially expanding patient reach and therapeutic benefit of CPIs,\nthereby expanding market reach, placing us in a position of strength for corporate partnering. Based on the\nclinical data we have generated in oncology, as well as preclinical data we have generated in autoimmune\nSHAREHOLDER LETTER (CONT’D)\ndisease, we believe we are well positioned to establish additional strategic partnerships and transactions\nstructured with the objective of achieving optimal upside for our shareholders, while addressing capital access\nfor building out our promising pipeline of potentially breakthrough therapeutic candidates.\nWe would like to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to our committed shareholders, passionate\nemployees, board of directors, scientific advisory board, clinical investigators and our collaboration partners\nfor their continued support, guidance and trust. Most importantly, we extend our profound appreciation and\nrespect to the patients and their families who have participated in our clinical trials, enabling us to gain insights\nand knowledge essential for continued progress in the fight against cancer and other debilitating diseases.\nSincerely,\nDaniel Passeri, M.Sc., J.D.

Key findings included_  _an objective response rate (ORR) of 46%, 12-month overall survival (OS) of 91.3% and a median overall survival (mOS) of 21.8 months in first line (1L) HPV+ R/M HNSCC patients, as well as an ORR of 50% in the subset of 1L patients with low PD-L1 expression (combined positive score (CPS) 1-19)_\n    * _Updated data from Phase 1 monotherapy trial of CUE-102 included_ _evidence of selective expansion of WT1-specific T cells and anti-tumor activity, as well as a favorable tolerability profile with no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)__in patients with Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1)-expressing colorectal, gastric, ovarian and pancreatic cancers_\n  * Demonstrated disease control rate (DCR) of 67% in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients treated with CUE-102 monotherapy, including an unconfirmed partial response (PR) with a 40% decrease in tumor burden\n  * Announced pricing of $12.0 million public offering\n  * Appointed industry veteran Lucinda Warren as Chief Business Officer\n  * Continued advancement of preclinical programs, CUE-401 for induction and expansion of regulatory T cells, in collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical, and CUE-501 for B cell depletion, positioning both programs towards drug candidate selection\n\n\n\n“We are very pleased with the validating updated clinical data from our Phase 1 trials for both CUE-101 and CUE-102,” said Daniel Passeri, chief executive officer of Cue Biopharma. “Importantly, we believe the maturing data further supports and strengthens our competitive differentiation and positioning for selective modulation of disease-specific T cells. This data further bolsters our confidence that the CUE-100 series, exemplified by CUE-101 and CUE-102, represents the potential of establishing a new standard of care for cancer patients. We are also very pleased with the continued progress of our preclinical autoimmune programs, both of which have moved closer towards drug candidate selection.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Collaboration revenue increased by $1.2 million to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to revenue earned from the Ono Collaboration and Option Agreement, which was executed in February 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial costs and employee compensation, which includes stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in drug substance manufacturing costs related to the continued advancement of CUE-401.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.7 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation, which includes stock-based compensation.\n\nCollaboration revenue increased by $4.0 million to $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to revenue earned from the Ono Collaboration and Option Agreement, which was executed in February 2023.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $0.8 million to $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $29.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial costs and employee compensation, which includes stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in professional outside services related to the continued advancement of CUE-401.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $1.5 million to $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation, which includes stock-based compensation.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $32.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $48.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. The Company expects its current cash and cash equivalents to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n**Cue Biopharma, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss**  \n_**(Unaudited)**_  \n_**(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)**_  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,** | **Nine Months Ended****September 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Collaboration revenue** | $ | 3,336 | $ | 2,100 | $ | 7,711 | $ | 3,669  \n**Operating expenses:**  \nGeneral and administrative | 2,867 | 3,645 | 10,564 | 12,071  \nResearch and development | 9,381 | 9,874 | 29,111 | 29,915  \nGain on fixed asset disposal |  (97) | - |  (97) | -  \nTotal operating expenses | 12,151 | 13,519 | 39,578 | 41,986  \n**Loss from operations** | (8,815) | (11,419) | (31,867) | (38,317)  \n**Other income (expense):**  \nInterest income | 343 | 700 | 1,332 | 1,756  \nInterest expense | (188) | (286) | (643) | (738)  \n**Total other income, net** | 155 | 414 | 689 | 1,018  \n**Net loss** | $ | (8,660) | $ | (11,005) | $ | (31,178) | $ | (37,299)  \nUnrealized gain from available-for-sale securities | - | 5 | - | 96  \n**Comprehensive loss** | $ | (8,660) | $ | (11,000) | $ | (31,178) | $ | (37,203)  \nNet loss per common share – basic and diluted | $ | (0.17) | $ | (0.24) | $ | (0.62) | $ | (0.82)  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding – basic and diluted | 51,229,701 | 46,358,555 | 50,292,983 | 45,274,124  \n**Cue Biopharma, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(Unaudited, In thousands)**  \n**September 30 , 2024** | **December 31 , 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 32,420 | $ | 48,514  \nOther assets | 12,390 | 13,016  \n**Total assets** | $ | 44,810 | $ | 61,530  \n**Liabilities and stockholders’ equity**  \nLiabilities | $ | 19,444 | $ | 24,445  \nStockholders' equity | 25,366 | 37,085  \n**Total Liabilities and stockholders’ equity** | $ | 44,810 | $ | 61,530  \n  \n**About Cue Biopharma** Cue Biopharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is developing a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate disease-specific T cells directly within the patient’s body.

Important factors that could cause the company’s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the company’s ability to shift its focus to its autoimmune assets and achieve the cost savings that it is projecting; the company’s limited operating history, limited cash and a history of losses; the company’s ability to achieve profitability; potential setbacks in the company’s research and development efforts including negative or inconclusive results from its preclinical studies or clinical trials or the company’s ability to replicate in later clinical trials positive results found in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of its product candidates; serious and unexpected drug-related side effects or other safety issues experienced by participants in clinical trials; its ability to secure required U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other governmental approvals for its product candidates and the breadth of any approved indication; adverse effects caused by public health pandemics, including possible effects on the company’s trials; delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines including potential delays in submitting required regulatory applications to the FDA; the company’s reliance on licensors, collaborators, contract research organizations, suppliers and other business partners; the company’s ability to obtain adequate financing to fund its business operations in the future; the company’s ability to maintain and enforce necessary patent and other intellectual property protection; competitive factors; general economic and market conditions and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of the company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q.
