(Nasdaq: ALVR) today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine with Kalaris Therapeutics (“Kalaris”) in an all-stock transaction (the “Merger”). Under the terms of the agreement, AlloVir will acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interest of Kalaris. Upon completion of the Merger, pre-Merger AlloVir stockholders are expected to own approximately 25.05% of the combined company and pre-Merger Kalaris stockholders are expected to own approximately 74.95% of the combined company, subject to certain adjustments described in the merger agreement. Upon closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately $100 million in cash, which is expected to be sufficient to fund the combined company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2026. After closing, the combined company is expected to operate under the name Kalaris Therapeutics, Inc. and trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “KLRS.”\n\n\"On behalf of the AlloVir board, I am thrilled that we have entered into this transformational merger agreement with Kalaris,” said David Hallal, Chairman of the Board of AlloVir. “The combination of our financial resources, with Kalaris’ TH103 asset from the lab of the renowned Dr. Napoleone Ferrara, will help accelerate the clinical development of TH103 for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (“nAMD”) as well as other diseases such as diabetic macular edema (“DME”) and retinal vein occlusion (“RVO”). I am also looking forward to once again working with many members of the Kalaris board and management team with the goal of again ushering in a new era for the retina community by delivering an innovation for targeted VEGF inhibition.”\n\nKalaris is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of treatments for prevalent retinal diseases, founded by Samsara BioCapital and focused on development of TH103, a novel, differentiated anti-VEGF investigational therapy. Developed by Dr. Napoleone Ferrara, TH103 is a fully humanized, recombinant fusion protein currently being evaluated in an ongoing, Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of nAMD, with plans to develop TH103 for other neovascular and exudative diseases of the retina. TH103 acts against VEGF as a decoy receptor and has been engineered for improved VEGF inhibition and longer retention in the retina.\n\n“AlloVir ran a thorough and strategic process, and we believe that this transaction represents the company’s commitment to delivering value to the AlloVir stockholders,” said Diana Brainard, CEO of AlloVir. “Kalaris is strongly positioned with an innovative clinical stage asset with the potential to disrupt the large anti-VEGF market, with near-term, value-inflecting milestones and a well-credentialed management team to lead the combined company.”\n\n“We believe that TH103 has the potential to be a meaningful advance for patients suffering from a number of neovascular and exudative retinal diseases,” said Andrew Oxtoby, CEO of Kalaris Therapeutics. “Kalaris is currently enrolling a Phase 1 clinical trial, and we look forward to reporting initial data in treatment naïve nAMD patients in the third quarter of 2025.”\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor A is the primary mediator and target of pathologic angiogenesis and exudation in retinal vascular diseases. Anti-VEGF agents have revolutionized treatment for these diseases, and the global market for branded anti-VEGF agents is approximately $14 billion. Available data on real-world patient outcomes has consistently failed to replicate the results from registrational clinical trials, with most of this being attributed to suboptimal compliance1,2,3,4,5. Extending the interval between injections while maintaining visual acuity in the real-world setting has been the goal to improve clinical outcomes. A novel therapeutic that could provide longer acting and increased VEGF inhibition may represent a clinically meaningful advance over the current standard-of-care.\n\n“Napo Ferrara is a true pioneer in the anti-VEGF space, and I am grateful that he reached out to Samsara in 2019 to discuss the potentially market-changing therapy he was developing,” commented Srini Akkaraju, MD, PhD, Managing Partner of Samsara BioCapital, and Kalaris co-founder and board member. “TH103 may represent a significant advance in the treatment of multiple retinal diseases and builds on Dr. Ferrara’s legacy of developing anti-VEGF therapies over the past two decades. We are energized by the opportunity to enhance the standard-of-care and ease the treatment burden for patients.”\n\nBuilding on Dr. Akkaraju’s comments, TH103 inventor and Kalaris board member Napoleone Ferrara, MD, PhD added, “This fusion protein was specifically engineered to utilize the natural configuration of important domains of VEGF Receptor 1 and has demonstrated both potent anti-VEGF activity and sustained ocular residence time in preclinical studies. This could potentially lead to enhanced durability with less frequent dosing in the clinical setting.”\n\n**Phase 1 Clinical Trial Details**\n\nEnrollment in Kalaris’ Phase 1 clinical trial of TH103 has commenced, with initial data expected in the third quarter of 2025. The clinical trial is investigating TH103 in treatment-naïve patients that have been diagnosed with nAMD. The goals of the clinical trial are to evaluate safety, PK/PD, determine a maximum tolerated dose, and assess preliminary data supporting the anti-VEGF effect of TH103 on fluid and visual acuity.\n\n**About the Proposed Transaction: Management and Governance**\n\nFollowing the closing of the Merger, the combined company is expected to be led by current Kalaris Chief Executive Officer Andrew Oxtoby, current Kalaris Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Nau, PhD, MMS, and Matthew Feinsod, MD as the combined company’s Medical Lead. The combined company’s board of directors will be led by current AlloVir Chairman David Hallal, who will remain Chairman of the combined company’s board of directors. Samir Patel, MD, one of the Kalaris co-founders and the current Executive Chairman of Kalaris, is expected to become a member of the combined company’s board of directors, which is also planned to include Mr. Oxtoby, current Kalaris board member Anthony Adamis, MD, PhD, and Kalaris co-founders and current board members Napoleone Ferrara, MD, PhD, Srini Akkaraju, MD, PhD, and Mike Dybbs, PhD. Two additional members are expected to be named to the combined company’s board of directors, one to be selected by AlloVir and the other to be mutually agreed upon by the two companies. In addition to Dr. Ferrara’s expertise as a pioneer in the discovery of VEGF and anti-VEGF drug development, several board members bring significant experience from the field of retinal disease, with Mr. Hallal, Dr. Patel, and Dr. Adamis all previously holding executive positions at a number of ophthalmology biotechnology companies over the past 20 years.\n\nThe transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to approvals by the stockholders of each company, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC to register the shares of AlloVir common stock to be issued in connection with the merger, AlloVir having a minimum of $95.0 million of net cash as of the closing, and other customary closing conditions. In connection with the Merger, directors, officers, and certain stockholders of AlloVir and Kalaris have executed support agreements, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote all of their shares of capital stock in favor of the Merger.\n\nLeerink Partners is serving as exclusive financial advisor to AlloVir, and Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel to AlloVir. Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is serving as legal counsel to Kalaris.\n\n**Webcast Presentation**\n\nThe companies will host a webcast presentation to discuss the proposed transaction today, November 8th at 8:30 a.m. ET. Listeners can register for the webcast via this [LINK](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GkWURolsIbGfkqfyWa_4rzQLFNjl3vgafBIpBx0-7XTnXSAFEp4ylrB0iLu37BNQWgWeQCTRreZWkvZaTHUjmoexL1VtsXArgXL1uhxvXYUigMUEbXk9WgSIJGcERvukyHd0pYkO_nqsTq8IrBC4pA==).

(Nasdaq: ALVR), an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy company, today provided an update on its three Phase 3 clinical trials with posoleucel, an investigational off-the-shelf multi-virus-specific T cell therapy, which targets six viral pathogens in immunocompromised individuals: adenovirus (AdV), BK virus (BKV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and JC virus (JCV). The company will discontinue its three global Phase 3 posoleucel studies – for prevention of clinically significant infections or diseases by multiple viruses, treatment of virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis (vHC), and treatment of adenovirus (AdV) – following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). The company made the determination following three pre-planned analyses by three independent Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) each of which recommended stopping its respective trial for futility after a review of the data suggested that each study was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint. There were no observed safety concerns raised by any of the DSMBs.\n\nAlloVir is in the process of notifying regulatory agencies and clinical trial investigators involved in these trials of the findings.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the unexpected outcome of these trials, we are encouraged by the apparent safety profile of posoleucel,” said Diana Brainard, MD, Chief Executive Officer of AlloVir. “In light of the DSMB recommendations, we will discontinue the prevention, vHC and AdV Phase 3 trials. We will continue to analyze the data from these studies to understand any variables that may have impacted outcomes or any apparent subpopulation benefits. We thank the patients, investigators and staff who participated in the trials.”\n\nDr. Brainard continued, “We established pre-planned futility analyses across these three Phase 3 trials, as each assessed a potentially highly innovative treatment for patients suffering with severe and complex medical conditions lacking significant prior clinical development, and we also expected the trials would require substantial additional capital to bring them to completion. With these current results, we will immediately shift our focus to preserve our substantial remaining capital, review our pipeline and assess strategic options.”\n\nAlloVir will review strategic alternatives for the Company and its portfolio of virus-specific T cell therapies. Such alternatives may include a merger, sale, divestiture of assets, licensing, or other strategic transaction. As of September 30, 2023, AlloVir had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $213.3 million.\n\n**About AlloVir’s Earlier Stage Virus-Specific T cell Pipeline**\n\n_Adult Kidney Transplantation_ AlloVir has earlier reported the results of its completed Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating posoleucel for the treatment of BKV infection in adult kidney transplant patients. After 24 weeks of treatment, 39% of patients receiving posoleucel experienced a ≥1-log viral load reduction, compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo.\n\n_Acute Respiratory Infection_ The company has completed Part A of a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a trial with ALVR106 in 14 stem cell or solid organ transplant patients. ALVR106 is an investigational, allogeneic, off-the-shelf, multi-virus specific VST therapy candidate designed to target diseases caused by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Data has been accepted for presentation at a scientific conference in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n_Chronic Hepatitis B Infection_ ALVR107 is an investigational, allogeneic, off-the-shelf VST therapy designed to target hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected cells and potentially cure patients with chronic HBV infection. Preclinical and IND-enabling studies support the advancement of ALVR107 into a clinical proof of concept study as a next step.\n\n**About AlloVir** AlloVir is an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy company with a focus on restoring natural immunity against life-threatening viral diseases in pediatric and adult patients with weakened immune systems. The company's innovative and proprietary technology platforms leverage off-the-shelf, allogeneic, single- and multi-virus-specific T cells for patients with T cell deficiencies who are at risk from the life-threatening consequences of viral diseases.
