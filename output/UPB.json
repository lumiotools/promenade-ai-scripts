(Nasdaq: UPB), a clinical-stage company developing treatments for inflammatory diseases, with an initial focus on severe respiratory disorders, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a summary of recent business highlights.\n\n“At Upstream Bio, we continue to make significant progress toward developing verekitug, the only monoclonal antibody currently in clinical development that targets and inhibits the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor, in severe respiratory diseases with substantial unmet needs. We expect to report top-line data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials in severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in the second half of 2026 and the second half of 2025, respectively. In addition, we have initiated planning activities for a Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we anticipate dosing our first patient in this program in the second half of 2025,” said Rand Sutherland, M.D., Upstream Bio’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our recently completed initial public offering has provided us with sufficient capital to fund our planned operations through 2027, which will support our strategy of leveraging verekitug’s unique mechanism of action to improve treatment options for patients living with severe inflammatory diseases.”\n\nDr. Sutherland continued, “This quarter, we also presented data from our Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial of verekitug in asthma patients. PK/PD modeling of data from this study demonstrated that verekitug is highly potent, with an approximately 50% greater effect on fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) than has been previously reported with tezepelumab. Our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials are testing two extended dosing intervals of 12 and 24 weeks for patients with severe asthma, and 12 weeks for patients with CRSwNP, to determine whether verekitug’s potency will translate to a differentiated clinical profile, both from the standpoint of efficacy and dosing frequency.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * **Oral presentation of Phase 1b data at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Conference:** In September, Upstream Bio presented clinical data from its Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial of verekitug in adults with asthma. Predictive modeling based on observed pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters suggested that verekitug may exhibit high potency in asthma patients, with an approximately 1.5-fold greater maximal predicted reduction of FeNO compared to that reported for tezepelumab. PK/PD modeling predicted that verekitug 100 mg once every 12 weeks (Q12W) and 400 mg once every 24 weeks (Q24W) dosing regimens could maintain trough serum levels above FeNO EC90 levels for >95% of the dosing interval, supporting testing of these dosing regimens in the ongoing Phase 2 VALIANT clinical trial for verekitug in severe asthma. As previously reported, verekitug was well tolerated at all dose levels tested. Verekitug also demonstrated rapid and substantial treatment effects, including 100% TSLP receptor occupancy after one dose, up to 54% reduction in FeNO and up to 65% reduction in blood eosinophils at 12 weeks. These findings were sustained for up to 24 weeks after the last dose.\n  * **Completed upsized initial public offering (IPO)** : In October, Upstream completed its upsized IPO, raising approximately $293 million in gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Upstream issued 17,250,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $17.00 per share, which included 2,250,000 shares issued upon the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock.\n  * **Appointed biotech finance leader, Daniella Beckman, to Board of Directors:** In October, Upstream appointed Daniella Beckman to its Board of Directors as an independent director and chair of the Audit Committee. Ms. Beckman has more than 20 years of financial and operational leadership experience in the biotechnology industry, and currently serves as Chief Financial Officer of Tango Therapeutics. Ms. Beckman also serves on the boards of directors of Blueprint Medicines Corporation and Vor Biopharma Inc., and previously served on the boards of directors of 5:01 Acquisition Corp. and Translate Bio, Inc.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Upstream had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $220.7 million, as compared to $109.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Upstream’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024, together with net proceeds from the closing of its IPO in October 2024 of approximately $268.7 million, is expected to fund planned operations through 2027.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $15.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $7.6 million was primarily driven by an increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses related to our verekitug program.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $1.8 million was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses.\n\nNet loss was $16.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $12.9 million was largely due to increased research and development and general and administrative expenses, and other income recorded due to a change in the value of preferred stock right tranche liabilities.\n\n**Upcoming Events**\n\nUpstream Bio expects to participate in the following conferences:\n\n  * Piper Sandler 36th Annual Healthcare Conference, December 3-5, 2024\n  * 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, January 13-16, 2025\n  * 45th Annual TD Cowen Healthcare Conference, March 3-6, 2025\n\n\n\n**About Upstream Bio**\n\nUpstream Bio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing treatments for inflammatory diseases, with an initial focus on severe respiratory disorders.
