(Nasdaq: RNA), a biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs™), today announced it has expanded beyond rare skeletal muscle disorders and is opening up a new therapeutic field, precision cardiology, to address the root cause of genetic diseases of the heart. Avidity is advancing its first two new wholly-owned precision cardiology development candidates targeting rare genetic cardiomyopathies: AOC 1086 targeting PLN (phospholamban) cardiomyopathy and AOC 1072 targeting PRKAG2 (Protein Kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit Gamma 2) Syndrome. In addition, Avidity shared preclinical data from next-generation technology innovations demonstrating improved siRNA delivery and increased durability. \n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Avidity Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/974628/Avidity_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) Opens in a new window](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/974628/Avidity_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"Today marks a key milestone for Avidity as we leverage the broad utility of our proprietary AOC platform to address the underlying cause of genetic heart diseases in precision cardiology,\" said Sarah Boyce, president and chief executive officer at Avidity Biosciences. \"We are proud to be the first company to successfully deliver siRNA directly to skeletal muscle and now, we have demonstrated that we can deliver siRNA against targets in the heart in preclinical studies. With continued innovations to our AOC technology, we are expanding on the possibilities of RNA delivery. These advancements further our mission to profoundly improve people's lives by revolutionizing a new class of targeted RNA therapeutics.\" \n\nAOC 1072 and AOC 1086 are designed to deliver siRNA directly to the heart muscle to knock down specific disease-causing genetic mutations that cause rare genetic cardiomyopathies. In preclinical studies, AOC 1086 and AOC 1072 demonstrated robust siRNA delivery to the heart muscle and potent targeted knockdown of approximately 80% in cardiac PLN mRNA and PRKAG2 mRNA. AOC 1086 and AOC 1072 were well tolerated without any effect on electrocardiogram parameters for evaluating cardiac safety in preclinical studies. Preclinical data from AOC 1072 targeting PRKAG2 will be presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2024 on November 16 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAvidity also shared a first-look at next-generation technology innovations, including siRNA modifications and evolved antibody engineering, which, in preclinical studies provided up to 30-fold increase in siRNA delivery in skeletal muscle, and greater durability with sustained target inhibition for three months. Advancements in siRNA delivery and greater durability allow the opportunity for less frequent dosing and improved patient convenience.\n\n**Video Webcast Information** The company is hosting Volume 11 of its investor and analyst event series on November 12, 2024, beginning at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss preclinical data on AOC 1072 and AOC 1086, along with platform innovations.

A replay of the webcast will be archived on Avidity's website following the event.\n\n**About PLN Cardiomyopathy** PLN (Phospholamban) Cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant, progressive cardiac disease caused by a mutation on the PLN gene. The most common disease variant is the R14del, causing a buildup of toxic protein aggregates that trigger cardiomyocyte death leading to dilation of the heart chambers, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), sudden cardiac arrest and heart failure. There are no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for PLN cardiomyopathy, and current standard of care focuses on symptom management with medications or invasive treatments including pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Patients who develop progressive heart failure may require a heart transplant. \n\n**About PRKAG2 Syndrome** PRKAG2 (Protein Kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit Gamma 2) Syndrome is an autosomal dominant, progressive cardiac disease caused by a mutation on the PRKAG2 gene that results in increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. This causes excessive cardiac glycogen storage in the heart, leading to cardiac hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle) and multiple different types of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac conduction system disease. As a result, patients with PRKAG2 syndrome are at an increased risk of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest or heart failure. There are no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for PRKAG2 Syndrome, and current standard of care focuses on symptom management with medications or invasive treatments including pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Patients who develop progressive heart failure may require a heart transplant.\n\n**About Avidity** Avidity Biosciences, Inc.'s mission is to profoundly improve people's lives by delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics - Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs™).

(Nasdaq: RNA), a biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs™), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Avidity Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/974628/Avidity_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) Opens in a new window](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/974628/Avidity_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"We are executing three potentially registrational clinical trials in three rare diseases where there are limited or no therapeutic options available. We reported positive del-zota data from the 5 mg/kg cohort of our Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44™ trial for DMD44 and have initiated enrollment in the EXPLORE44-OLE™. In addition, enrollment is on track for del-desiran's global Phase 3 HARBOR™ trial in DM1 and we initiated the biomarker cohort of our FORTITUDE™ study in FSHD, marking a key step in our strategy to pursue a potential accelerated approval path for del-brax,\" said Sarah Boyce, president and chief executive officer at Avidity. \"As we build for the future, we look forward to sharing our exciting innovations in precision cardiology and a glimpse at our next-generation technology. We continue to build our global commercial infrastructure to provide potential new therapies to people living with these serious rare diseases as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"We were pleased to complete an additional upsized public offering in August following positive clinical data from our EXPLORE44 program. With a strong cash position of approximately $1.6 billion, we remain focused on advancing our programs, bringing forward additional candidates from our DMD pipeline, executing on our precision cardiology programs and building additional capabilities, including commercial functions, as well as expanding to countries outside of the US,\" said Mike MacLean, chief financial officer and chief business officer at Avidity.\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n**Del-zota (AOC 1044) for DMD44**\n\n  * In August, Avidity reported positive initial del-zota data from the 5 mg/kg cohort of the Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44™ trial in people living with DMD44 demonstrating unsurpassed delivery to skeletal muscle, unprecedented, unadjusted increase of 25% in near full-length dystrophin production with a profound reduction in creatine kinase levels to near normal, and robust exon 44 skipping. Del-zota demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability with most treatment emergent adverse events mild or moderate.\n  * The Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44 trial is fully enrolled and ongoing.\n  * In addition to the participants rolling over from the Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44 trial, Avidity has begun enrolling 10-15 new participants in the EXPLORE44 Open-label Extension study (OLE).\n\n\n\n**Del-brax (AOC 1020) for FSHD**\n\n  * In October, Avidity announced the initiation of the biomarker cohort in the Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE™ trial of del-brax. 2 mg/kg of del-brax will be administered every six weeks, designed to ensure continuous suppression of DUX4.\n  * In June of this year, Avidity reported positive initial del-brax 2 mg/kg data at four months from the Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE trial demonstrating unprecedented and consistent reductions of greater than 50% in DUX4 regulated genes, mean reductions of 25% or greater in novel circulating biomarker and creatine kinase, trends of functional improvement, and favorable safety and tolerability in people living with FSHD.\n  * Avidity remains on track to initiate the functional cohort in the FORTITUDE study in the first half of 2025.\n  * In July, the first participants from FORTITUDE began to roll over to the FORTITUDE Open-Label Extension (OLE) trial. All participants that complete FORTITUDE are eligible to enroll in the FORTITUDE-OLE™ trial.\n\n\n\n**Del-desiran (AOC 1001) for DM1**\n\n  * Enrollment for the global Phase 3 HARBOR™ trial is ongoing and on track.\n  * In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed the partial clinical hold on del-desiran.\n\n\n\n**Pipeline Advancements and Organizational Highlights**\n\n  * In November, Avidity plans to provide a first look at precision cardiology candidates. In addition, Avidity plans to share a glimpse at next-generation technology innovations.\n  * In August, Avidity announced it plans to advance additional candidates from its DMD franchise following robust del-zota data; Exon 45 is currently in IND-enabling studies.\n  * Kathleen Gallagher was promoted to chief program officer in September 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, which reflects a gross $345.1 million raise from a public offering.\n  * **Collaboration Revenue:** Collaboration revenues of $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $7.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 primarily relate to Avidity's research collaboration and license partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb. Collaboration revenues of $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $7.4 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily related to Avidity's research collaboration and license partnership with Eli Lilly and Company.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses**: R&D expenses include external and internal costs associated with research and development activities. These expenses were $77.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $47.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, and $208.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $138.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increases were primarily driven by the advancement of del-desiran, del-brax and del-zota, as well as internal and external costs related to the expansion of the company's overall research capabilities.\n  * **Gener****al and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses primarily consist of employee-related expenses, professional fees, insurance costs and patent filing and maintenance fees. These expenses were $23.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $13.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, and $57.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $38.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the company's expanded operations.\n\n\n\n**About Avidity** Avidity Biosciences, Inc.'s mission is to profoundly improve people's lives by delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics - Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs™).
