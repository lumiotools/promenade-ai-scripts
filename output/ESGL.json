NEWSPAR is a proprietary material developed by ESGL, specifically engineered to convert hazardous semiconductor waste into a safe and sustainable resource. Through advanced research and development, NEWSPAR has been transformed into the world’s first sustainable bricks made from semiconductor waste. These bricks are not only environmentally friendly but also highly durable and suitable for various construction applications. This groundbreaking achievement was unveiled at a special event celebrating this new era in eco-friendly innovation.\n\n**Driving Decarbonization and Advancing the Circular Economy**\n\nThis landmark achievement is set to drive substantial decarbonization across multiple supply chains, reinforcing the global shift toward a robust circular economy. It establishes a new benchmark for sustainable practices in critical industries, demonstrating the limitless potential of waste reutilization. The creation of NEWSPAR and its applications underscore ESGL's commitment to turning industrial waste into valuable resources, furthering the company's mission to minimize environmental impact.\n\n**Leadership Enthusiastically Endorses the Partnership**\n\nYeow Chin Hock, Senior Director of Facilities at STMicroelectronics Singapore expressed his excitement:_“At ST, our commitment to sustainability includes striving for zero waste. We have implemented solutions to create value from waste generated by our activities, by converting waste into secondary raw materials that can be used in other industries. This successful collaboration with ESGL underscores our belief that organisations must act collectively to accelerate sustainability together.”_\n\nLawrence Law, Executive Director, Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer at ESGL echoed the sentiment:_“We are thrilled to be one step closer to our mission of advancing a circular economy by collaborating with key industry partners like STMicroelectronics. This achievement is a significant win for the semiconductor industry as a whole. We are now entering an exciting phase of research aimed at expanding the application of circular synthetic fluorite products in concrete production, road building, and other manufacturing processes. Environmental stewardship, combined with visionary partnerships like this, is paving the way for a brighter, more sustainable future.”_\n\n**About ESGL Holdings Limited**\n\nESGL Holdings Limited is a Singapore-based carbon-neutral enviro-tech company dedicated to transforming industrial waste into circular products. With a commitment to sustainable waste management solutions, ESGL is a leading player in the environmental solutions industry. ESGL conducts all its operations through its operating entity incorporated in Singapore, Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte. Ltd.

It represents an alternative to natural fluorspar, which is heavily used in other industries. The recycling of this material helps reduce reliance on mining natural resources, divert waste from landfills, and lower the environmental impact of producing fluorspar. Through a proprietary high-temperature calcination and chemical synthesis technology developed by ESGL, synthetic fluorspar can be produced at an industrial scale, integrating it into other industries.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “shall,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “would,” “positioned,” “future,” “forecast,” “intend,” “plan,” “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements made in this press release regarding anticipated future financial and operating performance and results, including estimates for growth, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA, potential regional expansion, development of new products, partnerships, customer relationships, demand for waste processing, and sales of circular products. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on ESGL management’s current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements.\n\nA further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by ESGL and other documents that the Company may file or furnish with the SEC, which you are encouraged to read. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to the Company and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTIzMTA4NyM2NDc5ODI3IzIyNTY5NTg=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDI5Nzg2MGMtOWZjMC00ZDBlLTg3N2QtOTZjNmNiN2Q5ZDQ2LTEyNjg1MDc=/tiny/ESGL-Holdings-Limited.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/fc1db5eb-f494-4974-8d11-26aabb97b269/small/esgl-2024-logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fc1db5eb-f494-4974-8d11-26aabb97b269)\n\nSource: ESGL Holdings Limited\n"
