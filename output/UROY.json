(NASDAQ: UROY, TSX: URC)** (\"**URC** \" or the \"**Company** \") is pleased to announce that it acquired an existing royalty on the Millennium and Cree Extension Uranium Projects in Saskatchewan, Canada (the “**Projects** ”) from a third-party industrial gas company for total cash consideration of $6 million.\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * The acquired royalty is a net profit interest (NPI) of 10% on an approximate 20.6955% participating interest in the Projects. The royalty becomes payable after recovery of all qualifying preproduction expenditures incurred after the establishment of the royalty.\n  * The Millennium Project hosts an Indicated Mineral Resource of 75.9 million pounds U3O8 at an average grade of 2.39% U3O8 and an Inferred Resource of 29.0 Mlbs U3O8 at an average grade of 3.19% U3O8, which places it among the largest undeveloped uranium projects globally. (1)\n  * Cameco Corporation Inc. (“**Cameco** ”), the operator of the Projects, submitted an Environmental Impact Statement (“**EIS** ”) application in 2009 for the project, anticipated to produce 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of ore per year with a submitted potential mine life of 10 years.(2)\n  * The acquisition of the royalty on these two Projects provides URC exposure to approximately 12,800 hectares of ground in the highly prospective Athabasca Basin, with well-respected operators, and in one of the top mining jurisdictions in the world. Note 1: Resource estimates are on a 100% basis and have been summarized from Cameco’s Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2023. Note 2: Based on information contained on Cameco’s website.\n\n\n\nScott Melbye, Chief Executive Officer of URC stated: “ _We are very excited to acquire this significant royalty on the Millennium and Cree Extension Projects. Cameco has previously completed substantial development work on the Millennium project and it remains one of the largest undeveloped projects in Cameco’s portfolio. It represents an important potential contributor to the future global production pipeline. The transaction is another example of our ability to leverage the URC team’s experience and networks to source and execute accretive uranium royalty transactions._ ”\n\n**The Millennium Project**\n\nThe Millennium Project is an advanced stage, conventional uranium project located 36 km northwest of Cameco’s Key Lake Mill in Saskatchewan, Canada. The project is a joint venture between Cameco and Japan Canada Uranium (“**JCU** ”). Cameco’s equity share is stated at 69.9% and Cameco is the operator of the project. Cameco is one of the largest global providers of the uranium fuel needed to energize a clean-air world. JCU is a Canadian exploration company with a focus on Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, jointly owned by Uranium Energy Corp. and Denison Mines Corp. (“**Denison** ”). \n\nCameco has disclosed that the Millennium Project hosts estimated resources of 1.4 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.39% U3O8 for a total of 75.9 million pounds U3O8 in the indicated category and 0.4 million tons at an average grade of 3.19% U3O8 for a total of 29.0 Mlbs U3O8 in the inferred category. These estimates are on reported on a 100% basis.\n\nCameco has disclosed that it submitted a draft EIS submission for the project in 2009, which submission included anticipated production of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of ore per year with a submitted potential mine life of 10 years. Cameco chose to pull the EIS application on May 15, 2014, due to market conditions at the time.\n\n[![Figure 1 - Location of the Millennium deposit – Source: Cameco Corporation website](/_resources/news/20241028-fig1.png)](/_resources/news/20241028-fig1.png)\n\nFigure 1 - Location of the Millennium deposit – Source: Cameco Corporation website\n\n**The Cree Extension Project**\n\nThe Cree Extension Project is an Exploration stage project located 36 km northwest of Cameco’s Key Lake Mill. The project is a joint venture among Cameco, Orano Canada Inc., and JCU. The land is located west of Denison’s Wheeler River project and southwest of Cameco’s McArthur River project.\n\n**The Millennium and Cree Extension Royalty**\n\nThe royalty is a 10% NPI on an approximate 20.6955% participating interest in the Projects, which participating interest was previously transferred to the existing owners in 1992. As a profit-based NPI interest, the acquired royalty is calculated based upon generated revenue, with deductions for certain expenses and costs, which include cumulative expense accounts, including development costs.\n\n**About Uranium Royalty Corp.**\n\nUranium Royalty Corp. is the world’s only publicly traded uranium-focused royalty and streaming company.

(NASDAQ: UROY, TSX-V: URC)** (\"**URC** \" or the \"**Company** \") is pleased to announce that it has acquired an additional 1% gross revenue royalty interest on the Lance In-Situ Recovery (“ISR”) Uranium Mine in Wyoming, USA operated by Strata Energy Inc. (“Strata”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Peninsula Minerals Limited (“Peninsula”).\n\n**_Highlights_**\n\n  * _Near-term production potential:_ The Lance ISR Uranium Mine is a fully licensed mine, with Peninsula currently undertaking an updated feasibility study in preparation for a full re-start of ISR production. Mine production was idled in 2019 as the operator initiated a transition to a low-Ph mining method, but the project has been producing uranium in limited amounts during the test mining phase.\n  * _Additional exposure to U.S. uranium production:_ Provides URC with additional exposure to potential U.S. derived uranium production.\n  * _The royalty is a 1% gross revenue royalty interest:_ The royalty covers the entirety of the current permitted project area and expands upon URC’s existing 4% gross revenue royalty on portions of the Lance Project. It is applicable to all uranium and related minerals from the project area.\n\n\n\nThe royalty was acquired from an existing royalty holder and the consideration paid by the Company was US$1.25 million in cash.\n\nScott Melbye, Chief Executive Officer of URC stated: “URC couldn’t be more pleased with the addition of this comprehensive, near-term cash-flowing royalty on the Lance Project. We have great confidence in Peninsula’s management and technical teams to be able to bring this competitive asset into full production as one of the early movers, taking advantage of improving uranium markets. We look forward to the updated feasibility study recently announced by Peninsula.”\n\nMr. Melbye continued: “As the global nuclear fuel industry reassesses strategic and geopolitical risk, the value of American ISR uranium production in a resource-friendly state like Wyoming cannot be underestimated. As a result, we believe uranium projects in North America that are not only fully permitted and licensed, but free of control or influence from Russia and China, will attract stronger premiums as a result of the current geopolitical climate.”\n\n**The Project**\n\nThe Lance Project is an ISR uranium project located on the north-east flank of the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, USA and is comprised of approximately 38,416 acres of mixed surface and mineral right holdings including private access agreements as well as state and federal mining claims. In its annual report for the year ended September 31, 2021, Peninsula disclosed a JORC resource comprised of measured and indicated resources of 15.8 Mlbs at an average grade of 494 ppm U3O8 and inferred resources of 37.8 Mlbs at an average grade of 474 ppm U3O8 for the Lance Project. The estimate was disclosed as at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe project was licensed and constructed by Strata and commenced commercial operations in 2015. From September through December of 2018, Peninsula made a series of announcements outlining the proposed transition to low-pH mining, including suspending most of the alkaline-based production in order to reduce cash expenditures. By July 2019, Peninsula announced that it had determined to idle alkaline-based production activities and focus on completion of a low-pH field demonstration.\n\nOn February 26, 2021, Peninsula announced an update on its low-pH field demonstration activities at the project. Peninsula disclosed that the company initiated a field demonstration in August 2020 in a previously unmined area of Mine Unit 1 (MU1A) with the primary objective being to confirm the optimal operating conditions for the project. On March 28th, 2022, Peninsula announced that it was commencing an update to its 2018 Low-Ph ISR Feasibility Study, incorporating results and conclusions from Peninsula’s technical de-risking activities, including the recently completed MU1A Field Demonstration.\n\n**About Uranium Royalty Corp.**\n\nUranium Royalty Corp. is the world’s only uranium-focused royalty and streaming company and the only pure-play uranium listed company on the Nasdaq.
