The quarterly increase was a result of increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, as discussed in more detail below. The increase in third quarter 2024 earnings and diluted earnings per share when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 earnings of $12.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, was primarily due to the increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense.\n  * Earnings were $36.3 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to earnings of $40.8 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings and diluted earnings per share comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the rise in deposit costs year over year.\n  * At September 30, 2024, loans totaled $4.5 billion, excluding the balances of syndicated loans. This adjusted total of $4.5 billion in loans represented an increase of $96.7 million, or 2.18% (8.69% annualized), compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of June 30, 2024, and an increase of $153.4 million, or 3.51%, compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of September 30, 2023. The increase in loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by qualitative commercial and industrial growth in the Erie and Columbus markets and continued growth in new commercial customer relationships in the Corporation's recent expansion market of Roanoke, coupled with growth in CNB's Private Banking division with notable activity in the Roanoke market. The year over year growth in loans as of September 30, 2024 compared to loans as of September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from growth in the Corporation's continued expansion into the newer markets of Cleveland and Roanoke, combined with growth in the Columbus and Erie markets and CNB Bank’s Private Banking division. \n    * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's balance sheet reflected an increase in syndicated lending balances of $15.5 million compared to June 30, 2024. The increase in syndicated lending balances was the result of the Corporation managing the level of its syndicated portfolio by ensuring its historical discipline of seeking high credit quality loans with favorable yields. Year over year, the Corporation's balance sheet reported a decrease in syndicated lending balances of $53.6 million compared to September 30, 2023, resulting from scheduled paydowns or early payoffs of certain syndicated loans. The syndicated loan portfolio totaled $69.5 million, or 1.51% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $53.9 million, or 1.20% of total loans, at June 30, 2024 and $123.1 million, or 2.74% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. As noted above, the Corporation is closely managing the level of its syndicated loan portfolio while it focuses more resources on organic loan growth from its in-market customer relationships.\n  * At September 30, 2024, total deposits were $5.2 billion, reflecting an increase of $106.1 million, or 2.08% (8.26% annualized), from the previous quarter ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $214.2 million, or 4.28%, compared to total deposits measured as of September 30, 2023. The increase in deposit balances compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest-bearing business deposits and retail saving deposits. Additional deposit and liquidity profile details were as follows: \n    * During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation repositioned $135.0 million of brokered deposits from savings to certificates of deposits. Additionally, $50.0 million of maturing brokered certificates of deposit were replaced with a similar offering. The repositioning and replacement totaling $185.0 million during the quarter and reduced the weighted average annual percentage yield (\"APY\") from 5.70% to a locked-in APY of 4.37%, for maturity periods ranging from 12-14 months. This adjustment is expected to result in an estimated annual interest expense savings of $2.5 million for the Corporation. The mix of brokered deposits of 3.55% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, remained stable with the mix of 3.58% of total deposits at June 30, 2024.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 28.50% of total CNB Bank deposits. However, when excluding $103.1 million of affiliate company deposits and $462.7 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $950.6 million, or approximately 17.87% of total CNB Bank deposits as of September 30, 2024. \n      * The level of adjusted uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 was relatively unchanged with the prior quarter end's level. At June 30, 2024, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 29.00% of total CNB Bank deposits; however, when excluding $101.4 million of affiliate company deposits and $460.7 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $949.8 million, or approximately 18.22% of total CNB Bank deposits as of June 30, 2024.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the average deposit balance per account for CNB Bank was approximately $33 thousand, which generally remained consistent with the average deposit balance per account from recent quarters. CNB Bank had increases in the volume of business deposits, as well as retail customer household deposits, including those added after the 2023 launches of (i) CNB Bank’s “At Ease” account, a service for U.S. service member and veteran families, and (ii) CNB’s women-focused banking division, Impressia Bank.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $282.0 million of cash equivalents held in CNB Bank’s interest-bearing deposit account at the Federal Reserve. These excess funds, when combined with collective contingent liquidity resources of $4.5 billion including (i) available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\") and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, resulted in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation as of September 30, 2024 to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances discussed above.\n  * At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Corporation had no outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve's Discount Window.\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's pre-tax net unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled approximately $62.5 million, or 10.30% of total shareholders' equity, compared to $84.1 million, or 14.33% of total shareholders' equity, at June 30, 2024. The change in unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in the yield curve in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, coupled with the Corporation’s scheduled bond maturities, which were all realized at par. Importantly, all regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation would still exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 if the net unrealized losses at the respective dates were fully recognized. Additionally, the Corporation maintained $102.0 million of liquid funds at its holding company, which more than covers the $62.5 million in unrealized losses on investments held primarily in its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, as an immediately available source of contingent capital to be down-streamed to CNB Bank, if necessary.\n  * Total nonperforming assets were approximately $42.0 million, or 0.70% of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $36.5 million, or 0.62% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024, and $29.3 million, or 0.51% of total assets, as of September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to one commercial relationship (consisting of various loan types) totaling $7.9 million with a specific reserve balance of $2.2 million. Management does not believe there is risk of significant additional loss exposures beyond the specific reserves related to this loan relationship. The increase in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was due to the loan relationship discussed above, as well as certain commercial and industrial relationships as previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024, and a commercial real estate relationship as previously disclosed in the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.8 million, or 0.25% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $732 thousand, or 0.06% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\"), a non-GAAP measure, was $19.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.6 million and $18.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 The third quarter 2024 PPNR, when compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflected improvements in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. The increase in PPNR for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the increase in non-interest income. PPNR was $55.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1 The decrease in PPNR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in deposit costs, coupled with increases in certain personnel costs (primarily from new offices and personnel added in expansion markets), as well as additional technology expenses for recently completed full implementation of business development and customer relationship management applications.\n\n\n\n1 This release contains references to certain financial measures that are not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section.\n\nMichael Peduzzi, President and CEO of both the Corporation and CNB Bank, commented on the Corporation’s positive quarterly results, stating, \"CNB’s performance for the third quarter of 2024 was much in alignment with themes in a time of year when so many sports are active. We continue to have a strong defense with our traditionally sound loan and investment underwriting, disciplined loan and deposit pricing, and solid risk management practices. This was complemented by a solid offensive push as we translated pipeline activity and qualified business leads into sound loan growth, and an expansion of the number of relationships and accounts in our deposit base, all leading to notable increases in revenues. Further, thanks to effective “special team” efforts by our Finance team, we closely monitored market conditions and took advantage of an opportunity to realize substantial interest expense savings by repositioning a large portion of wholesale funding sources.\n\nThe Corporation’s team across our entire footprint continues to be focused on controlling staffing levels and overhead cost management, while expanding the use of the Corporation’s previous investments in key sales and customer experience technologies. Our playbook for implementing our overall strategy remains the same – to maintain a team of motivated and engaged employees delivering products and services to achieve mutually beneficial and sustainable success for our clients and investors.\"\n\n**_Other Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\n  * Book value per common share was $26.13 at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase from $25.19 at June 30, 2024 and $23.52 at September 30, 2023. Tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was $24.03 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $0.94, or 16.20% (annualized) from $23.09 as of June 30, 2024 and a year-over-year increase of $2.63, or 12.29%, from $21.40 as of September 30, 2023.1 The increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to June 30, 2024 were primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in retained earnings and a $10.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past three months. The increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to September 30, 2023 were primarily due to (i) a $34.4 million increase in retained earnings over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) the Corporation's repurchase of 23,988 common shares at a weighted average price of $18.38 in the second quarter of 2024, and (iii) a $21.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past twelve months.\n\n\n\n**_Loan Portfolio Profile_**\n\n  * As part of our lending policy and risk management activities, the Corporation tracks lending exposure by industry classification and type to determine potential risks associated with industry concentrations, and if any concentration risk issues could lead to additional credit loss exposure. In the current post-pandemic and relatively inflationary economic environment, the Corporation has continued to evaluate its exposure to the office, hospitality, and multifamily industries within its commercial real estate portfolio. Even given the Corporation’s historically sound underwriting protocols and high credit quality ratings for borrowers in the commercial real estate industry segments, the Corporation monitors numerous relevant sensitivity elements, including occupancy, loan-to-value, absorption and cap rates, debt service coverage and covenant compliance, and developer/lessor financial strength both in the project and globally. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had the following key metrics related to its office, hospitality and multifamily portfolios:\n\n\n  * **_Commercial office loans_** : \n    * There were 114 outstanding loans, totaling $117.0 million, or 2.55%, of the Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There were no nonaccrual commercial office loans at September 30, 2024;\n    * There was one past due commercial office loan that totaled $214 thousand, or 0.18% of total commercial office loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $1.0 million.\n\n\n  * **_Commercial hospitality loans_** : \n    * There were 173 outstanding loans, totaling $320.6 million, or 6.98%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There were no nonaccrual commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024;\n    * There were no past due commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial hospitality loan was $1.9 million.\n\n\n  * **_Commercial multifamily loans_** : \n    * There were 225 outstanding loans, totaling $349.1 million, or 7.60%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There was one nonaccrual commercial multifamily loan that totaled $268 thousand, or 0.08% of total multifamily loans outstanding. The one customer relationship did not have a related specific loss reserve at September 30, 2024\n    * There were two past due commercial office loans that totaled $760 thousand, or 0.22% of total commercial multifamily loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial multifamily loan was $1.6 million.\n\n\n\nThe Corporation had no commercial office, hospitality or multifamily loan relationships considered by the banking regulators to be a high volatility commercial real estate credit (\"HVCRE\").\n\n**_Performance Ratios_**\n\n  * Annualized return on average equity was 9.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.94% and 9.80% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Annualized return on average equity was 9.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.93% and 11.07% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1 \n\n\n  * The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 66.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.94% and 67.00% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 65.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.20% and 66.26% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation related accruals which are based on various components of the Corporation's financial performance for the year.\n\n\n  * The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 67.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 66.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.60% the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1\n\n\n\n**_Revenue_**\n\n  * Total revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income) was $58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $54.6 million and $55.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n    * Net interest income was $47.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $45.7 million and $47.2 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. When comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2024, the difference in net interest income of $1.8 million, or 3.87% (15.39% annualized), reflected the increase in total loans outstanding quarter over quarter, partially offset by targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit relationship retention and new deposit growth in the Corporation's markets.\n    * Net interest margin was 3.43%, 3.36% and 3.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.42%, 3.34% and 3.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 \n      * The yield on earning assets of 5.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9 basis points from June 30, 2024 and increased 35 basis points from September 30, 2023. The increases in yield compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were attributable to the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\n      * The cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 3.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 basis points from June 30, 2024 and 55 basis points from September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Corporation’s targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases for deposit retention and growth initiatives given the competitive environment resulting from the numerous Federal Reserve rate hikes since the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\n  * Total revenue was $167.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $166.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n    * Net interest income was $138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $142.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. When comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in net interest income of $3.7 million, or 2.61% (3.49% annualized), was due to loan growth and the benefits of the impact of higher interest rates resulting in greater income on variable-rate loans, coupled with a higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, being more than offset by an increase in the Corporation's interest expense as a result of targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit growth and retention.\n    * Net interest margin was 3.40% and 3.66% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.38% and 3.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.1 \n      * The yield on earning assets of 5.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 41 basis points from September 30, 2023. The increase in yield compared to September 30, 2023 was attributable to the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\n      * The cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 3.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 80 basis points from September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Corporation’s targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases for deposit retention and growth initiatives given the competitive environment resulting from the numerous Federal Reserve rate hikes since the first quarter of 2022. The Federal Reserve rate decrease announced in mid-September 2024, being only effective for a short period of time in the quarter, had no significant impact on the Corporation’s third quarter results.\n\n\n  * Total non-interest income was $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8.9 million and $7.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, notable changes compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 included increases in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities and higher pass-through income from small business investment companies (\"SBICs\"). The increase in third quarter 2024 noninterest income compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs and net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\n\n  * Total non-interest income was $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs coupled with an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\n\n\n**_Non-Interest Expense_**\n\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024 total non-interest expense was $38.8 million, compared to $36.0 million and $36.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.8 million, or 7.77%, from the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and benefits, card processing and interchange expenses, and other non-interest expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits resulted primarily from an increase in incentive compensation accruals, which are based on various components of the Corporation's financial performance for the year, coupled with the timing of profit-sharing accruals. The increase in card processing and interchange expenses related primarily to corporate cardholder rewards program accrual, while the increase in other non-interest expenses was primarily driven by the timing of expenditures and business generation related expenses. The increase in non-interest expense compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher salaries and benefits driven by costs for personnel added for new offices in expansion markets, an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases, increases in health insurance costs, and contractual renewal increases in the Corporation's investments in technology applications.\n\n\n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 total non-interest expense was $112.2 million, compared to $106.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $5.3 million, or 4.96%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and benefits and technology expenses, partially offset by a decrease in card processing and interchange expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits was driven by an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases and growth in the Corporation's staff and new offices in its expansion markets, while the increase in technology was primarily due to year-over-year investments in technology applications aimed at enhancing both customer online banking capabilities, customer call center communications, and in-branch technology delivery channels. The decrease in card processing and interchange expenses related to the changes made by the Corporation to its cardholder rewards program.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\n  * Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.3 million, representing a 19.31% effective tax rate, compared to $3.0 million, representing an 19.03% effective tax rate, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $3.4 million, representing a 19.86% effective tax rate, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.2 million, representing an 18.92% effective tax rate compared to $10.6 million, representing a 19.47% effective tax rate, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\n  * Total nonperforming assets were approximately $42.0 million, or 0.70% of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $36.5 million, or 0.62% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024, and $29.3 million, or 0.51% of total assets, as of September 30, 2023, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * The allowance for credit losses measured as a percentage of total loans was 1.02% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.02% as of both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. In addition, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 117.03% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 130.88% and 169.34% as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to the levels of nonperforming assets, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * The provision for credit losses was $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The $1.3 million increase in the provision expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily a result of higher loan portfolio growth and increased net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.8 million, or 0.25% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $732 thousand, or 0.06% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $5.4 million, or 0.16% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.2 million, or 0.07% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with most of the larger year-to-date charge-offs being as previously disclosed occurring in the first and second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Capital_**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total shareholders’ equity was $606.4 million, representing an increase of $19.7 million, or 3.35% (13.33% annualized), from June 30, 2024 and an increase of $57.2 million, or 10.41%, from September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's retained earnings (net income, partially offset by the common and preferred stock dividends paid) and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past twelve months. The additions to shareholders equity from retained earnings were partially offset by the Corporation's repurchase of its common stock, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * Regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation continue to exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of September 30, 2024, consistent with prior periods.\n\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of common shareholders' equity to total assets was 9.12% compared to 8.99% at June 30, 2024 and 8.57% at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure, was 8.45% compared to 8.30% at June 30, 2024 and 7.86% at September 30, 2023. The increases compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of an increase in retained earnings coupled with a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, as discussed above.1\n\n\n\n**About CNB Financial Corporation**\n\nCNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $6.0 billion.

analysis of the Corporation’s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Corporation’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Corporation’s financial performance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently.

These forward-looking statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995. Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to beliefs, plans, objectives, goals,\nexpectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors (some of which are beyond\nthe Corporation’s control). Forward-looking statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “potentially,”\n“probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would” and “could.” The Corporation’s actual results may differ\nmaterially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Such known\nand unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the statements, include, but are not limited to, (i) adverse changes or\nconditions in capital and financial markets, including actual or potential stresses in the banking industry; (ii) changes in interest rates; (iii) changes in general business, industry or\neconomic conditions or competition; (iv) changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or practice governing or affecting financial holding companies and their\nsubsidiaries or with respect to tax or accounting principles or otherwise; (v) higher than expected costs or other difficulties related to integration of combined or merged businesses; (vi)\nthe effects of business combinations and other acquisition transactions, including the inability to realize our loan and investment portfolios; (vii) changes in the quality or composition of\nour loan and investment portfolios; (viIi) adequacy of loan loss reserves; (ix) increased competition; (x) loss of certain key officers; (xi) deposit attrition; (xii) rapidly changing technology;\n(xiii) unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings and liabilities and other costs; (xiv) changes in the cost of funds, demand for loan products or demand for financial services; and\n(xv) other economic, competitive, governmental or technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such developments could have an adverse\nimpact on the Corporation's financial position and results of operations. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements, please refer to the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of and the forward-looking\nstatement disclaimers in the Corporation’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions and are made as of the date of this presentation. Factors or events that could cause the\nCorporation’s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Corporation to predict all of them. The Corporation undertakes no obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this presentation or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements,\nwhether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events\ndiscussed in this presentation might not occur and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial information in its analysis\nof the Corporation’s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of\noperations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Corporation’s management believes that investors may use these non-\nGAAP measures to analyze the Corporation’s financial performance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation’s underlying\nperformance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations\nassociated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies\nmight calculate these measures differently.

Management uses non-GAAP financial information in its\nanalysis of the Corporation’s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing\noperations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods\npresented. The Corporation’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Corporation’s financial\nperformance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP\ndata should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\nLimitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in\nthese measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently.

The quarterly increase was a result of increases in both net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, as discussed in more detail below. The increase in third quarter 2024 earnings and diluted earnings per share when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 earnings of $12.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, was primarily due to the increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense.\n  * Earnings were $36.3 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to earnings of $40.8 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in earnings and diluted earnings per share comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the rise in deposit costs year over year.\n  * At September 30, 2024, loans totaled $4.5 billion, excluding the balances of syndicated loans. This adjusted total of $4.5 billion in loans represented an increase of $96.7 million, or 2.18% (8.69% annualized), compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of June 30, 2024, and an increase of $153.4 million, or 3.51%, compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of September 30, 2023. The increase in loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by qualitative commercial and industrial growth in the Erie and Columbus markets and continued growth in new commercial customer relationships in the Corporation's recent expansion market of Roanoke, coupled with growth in CNB's Private Banking division with notable activity in the Roanoke market. The year over year growth in loans as of September 30, 2024 compared to loans as of September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from growth in the Corporation's continued expansion into the newer markets of Cleveland and Roanoke, combined with growth in the Columbus and Erie markets and CNB Bank’s Private Banking division. \n    * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's balance sheet reflected an increase in syndicated lending balances of $15.5 million compared to June 30, 2024. The increase in syndicated lending balances was the result of the Corporation managing the level of its syndicated portfolio by ensuring its historical discipline of seeking high credit quality loans with favorable yields. Year over year, the Corporation's balance sheet reported a decrease in syndicated lending balances of $53.6 million compared to September 30, 2023, resulting from scheduled paydowns or early payoffs of certain syndicated loans. The syndicated loan portfolio totaled $69.5 million, or 1.51% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $53.9 million, or 1.20% of total loans, at June 30, 2024 and $123.1 million, or 2.74% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. As noted above, the Corporation is closely managing the level of its syndicated loan portfolio while it focuses more resources on organic loan growth from its in-market customer relationships.\n  * At September 30, 2024, total deposits were $5.2 billion, reflecting an increase of $106.1 million, or 2.08% (8.26% annualized), from the previous quarter ended June 30, 2024, and an increase of $214.2 million, or 4.28%, compared to total deposits measured as of September 30, 2023. The increase in deposit balances compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest-bearing business deposits and retail saving deposits. Additional deposit and liquidity profile details were as follows: \n    * During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation repositioned $135.0 million of brokered deposits from savings to certificates of deposits. Additionally, $50.0 million of maturing brokered certificates of deposit were replaced with a similar offering. The repositioning and replacement totaling $185.0 million during the quarter and reduced the weighted average annual percentage yield (\"APY\") from 5.70% to a locked-in APY of 4.37%, for maturity periods ranging from 12-14 months. This adjustment is expected to result in an estimated annual interest expense savings of $2.5 million for the Corporation. The mix of brokered deposits of 3.55% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, remained stable with the mix of 3.58% of total deposits at June 30, 2024.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 28.50% of total CNB Bank deposits. However, when excluding $103.1 million of affiliate company deposits and $462.7 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $950.6 million, or approximately 17.87% of total CNB Bank deposits as of September 30, 2024. \n      * The level of adjusted uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 was relatively unchanged with the prior quarter end's level. At June 30, 2024, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 29.00% of total CNB Bank deposits; however, when excluding $101.4 million of affiliate company deposits and $460.7 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $949.8 million, or approximately 18.22% of total CNB Bank deposits as of June 30, 2024.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the average deposit balance per account for CNB Bank was approximately $33 thousand, which generally remained consistent with the average deposit balance per account from recent quarters. CNB Bank had increases in the volume of business deposits, as well as retail customer household deposits, including those added after the 2023 launches of (i) CNB Bank’s “At Ease” account, a service for U.S. service member and veteran families, and (ii) CNB’s women-focused banking division, Impressia Bank.\n    * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had $282.0 million of cash equivalents held in CNB Bank’s interest-bearing deposit account at the Federal Reserve. These excess funds, when combined with collective contingent liquidity resources of $4.5 billion including (i) available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\") and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, resulted in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation as of September 30, 2024 to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances discussed above.\n  * At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Corporation had no outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve's Discount Window.\n  * At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's pre-tax net unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled approximately $62.5 million, or 10.30% of total shareholders' equity, compared to $84.1 million, or 14.33% of total shareholders' equity, at June 30, 2024. The change in unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in the yield curve in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, coupled with the Corporation’s scheduled bond maturities, which were all realized at par. Importantly, all regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation would still exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 if the net unrealized losses at the respective dates were fully recognized. Additionally, the Corporation maintained $102.0 million of liquid funds at its holding company, which more than covers the $62.5 million in unrealized losses on investments held primarily in its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, as an immediately available source of contingent capital to be down-streamed to CNB Bank, if necessary.\n  * Total nonperforming assets were approximately $42.0 million, or 0.70% of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $36.5 million, or 0.62% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024, and $29.3 million, or 0.51% of total assets, as of September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to one commercial relationship (consisting of various loan types) totaling $7.9 million with a specific reserve balance of $2.2 million. Management does not believe there is risk of significant additional loss exposures beyond the specific reserves related to this loan relationship. The increase in non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was due to the loan relationship discussed above, as well as certain commercial and industrial relationships as previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024, and a commercial real estate relationship as previously disclosed in the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.8 million, or 0.25% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $732 thousand, or 0.06% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\"), a non-GAAP measure, was $19.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.6 million and $18.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 The third quarter 2024 PPNR, when compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflected improvements in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. The increase in PPNR for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the increase in non-interest income. PPNR was $55.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1 The decrease in PPNR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in deposit costs, coupled with increases in certain personnel costs (primarily from new offices and personnel added in expansion markets), as well as additional technology expenses for recently completed full implementation of business development and customer relationship management applications.\n\n\n\n1 This release contains references to certain financial measures that are not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section.\n\nMichael Peduzzi, President and CEO of both the Corporation and CNB Bank, commented on the Corporation’s positive quarterly results, stating, \"CNB’s performance for the third quarter of 2024 was much in alignment with themes in a time of year when so many sports are active. We continue to have a strong defense with our traditionally sound loan and investment underwriting, disciplined loan and deposit pricing, and solid risk management practices. This was complemented by a solid offensive push as we translated pipeline activity and qualified business leads into sound loan growth, and an expansion of the number of relationships and accounts in our deposit base, all leading to notable increases in revenues. Further, thanks to effective “special team” efforts by our Finance team, we closely monitored market conditions and took advantage of an opportunity to realize substantial interest expense savings by repositioning a large portion of wholesale funding sources.\n\nThe Corporation’s team across our entire footprint continues to be focused on controlling staffing levels and overhead cost management, while expanding the use of the Corporation’s previous investments in key sales and customer experience technologies. Our playbook for implementing our overall strategy remains the same – to maintain a team of motivated and engaged employees delivering products and services to achieve mutually beneficial and sustainable success for our clients and investors.\"\n\n**_Other Balance Sheet Highlights_**\n\n  * Book value per common share was $26.13 at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase from $25.19 at June 30, 2024 and $23.52 at September 30, 2023. Tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was $24.03 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $0.94, or 16.20% (annualized) from $23.09 as of June 30, 2024 and a year-over-year increase of $2.63, or 12.29%, from $21.40 as of September 30, 2023.1 The increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to June 30, 2024 were primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in retained earnings and a $10.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past three months. The increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to September 30, 2023 were primarily due to (i) a $34.4 million increase in retained earnings over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) the Corporation's repurchase of 23,988 common shares at a weighted average price of $18.38 in the second quarter of 2024, and (iii) a $21.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past twelve months.\n\n\n\n**_Loan Portfolio Profile_**\n\n  * As part of our lending policy and risk management activities, the Corporation tracks lending exposure by industry classification and type to determine potential risks associated with industry concentrations, and if any concentration risk issues could lead to additional credit loss exposure. In the current post-pandemic and relatively inflationary economic environment, the Corporation has continued to evaluate its exposure to the office, hospitality, and multifamily industries within its commercial real estate portfolio. Even given the Corporation’s historically sound underwriting protocols and high credit quality ratings for borrowers in the commercial real estate industry segments, the Corporation monitors numerous relevant sensitivity elements, including occupancy, loan-to-value, absorption and cap rates, debt service coverage and covenant compliance, and developer/lessor financial strength both in the project and globally. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had the following key metrics related to its office, hospitality and multifamily portfolios:\n\n\n  * **_Commercial office loans_** : \n    * There were 114 outstanding loans, totaling $117.0 million, or 2.55%, of the Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There were no nonaccrual commercial office loans at September 30, 2024;\n    * There was one past due commercial office loan that totaled $214 thousand, or 0.18% of total commercial office loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $1.0 million.\n\n\n  * **_Commercial hospitality loans_** : \n    * There were 173 outstanding loans, totaling $320.6 million, or 6.98%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There were no nonaccrual commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024;\n    * There were no past due commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial hospitality loan was $1.9 million.\n\n\n  * **_Commercial multifamily loans_** : \n    * There were 225 outstanding loans, totaling $349.1 million, or 7.60%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n    * There was one nonaccrual commercial multifamily loan that totaled $268 thousand, or 0.08% of total multifamily loans outstanding. The one customer relationship did not have a related specific loss reserve at September 30, 2024\n    * There were two past due commercial office loans that totaled $760 thousand, or 0.22% of total commercial multifamily loans outstanding at September 30, 2024; and\n    * The average outstanding balance per commercial multifamily loan was $1.6 million.\n\n\n\nThe Corporation had no commercial office, hospitality or multifamily loan relationships considered by the banking regulators to be a high volatility commercial real estate credit (\"HVCRE\").\n\n**_Performance Ratios_**\n\n  * Annualized return on average equity was 9.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.94% and 9.80% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Annualized return on average equity was 9.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.93% and 11.07% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1 \n\n\n  * The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 66.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.94% and 67.00% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 65.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 65.20% and 66.26% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation related accruals which are based on various components of the Corporation's financial performance for the year.\n\n\n  * The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 67.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 66.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.60% the nine months ended September 30, 2023.1\n\n\n\n**_Revenue_**\n\n  * Total revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income) was $58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $54.6 million and $55.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. \n    * Net interest income was $47.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $45.7 million and $47.2 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. When comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2024, the difference in net interest income of $1.8 million, or 3.87% (15.39% annualized), reflected the increase in total loans outstanding quarter over quarter, partially offset by targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit relationship retention and new deposit growth in the Corporation's markets.\n    * Net interest margin was 3.43%, 3.36% and 3.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.42%, 3.34% and 3.53% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.1 \n      * The yield on earning assets of 5.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9 basis points from June 30, 2024 and increased 35 basis points from September 30, 2023. The increases in yield compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were attributable to the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\n      * The cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 3.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4 basis points from June 30, 2024 and 55 basis points from September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Corporation’s targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases for deposit retention and growth initiatives given the competitive environment resulting from the numerous Federal Reserve rate hikes since the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\n  * Total revenue was $167.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $166.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n    * Net interest income was $138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $142.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. When comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in net interest income of $3.7 million, or 2.61% (3.49% annualized), was due to loan growth and the benefits of the impact of higher interest rates resulting in greater income on variable-rate loans, coupled with a higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, being more than offset by an increase in the Corporation's interest expense as a result of targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit growth and retention.\n    * Net interest margin was 3.40% and 3.66% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.38% and 3.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.1 \n      * The yield on earning assets of 5.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 41 basis points from September 30, 2023. The increase in yield compared to September 30, 2023 was attributable to the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\n      * The cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 3.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 80 basis points from September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the Corporation’s targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases for deposit retention and growth initiatives given the competitive environment resulting from the numerous Federal Reserve rate hikes since the first quarter of 2022. The Federal Reserve rate decrease announced in mid-September 2024, being only effective for a short period of time in the quarter, had no significant impact on the Corporation’s third quarter results.\n\n\n  * Total non-interest income was $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8.9 million and $7.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, notable changes compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 included increases in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities and higher pass-through income from small business investment companies (\"SBICs\"). The increase in third quarter 2024 noninterest income compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs and net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\n\n  * Total non-interest income was $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs coupled with an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.\n\n\n\n**_Non-Interest Expense_**\n\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024 total non-interest expense was $38.8 million, compared to $36.0 million and $36.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.8 million, or 7.77%, from the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and benefits, card processing and interchange expenses, and other non-interest expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits resulted primarily from an increase in incentive compensation accruals, which are based on various components of the Corporation's financial performance for the year, coupled with the timing of profit-sharing accruals. The increase in card processing and interchange expenses related primarily to corporate cardholder rewards program accrual, while the increase in other non-interest expenses was primarily driven by the timing of expenditures and business generation related expenses. The increase in non-interest expense compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher salaries and benefits driven by costs for personnel added for new offices in expansion markets, an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases, increases in health insurance costs, and contractual renewal increases in the Corporation's investments in technology applications.\n\n\n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 total non-interest expense was $112.2 million, compared to $106.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $5.3 million, or 4.96%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and benefits and technology expenses, partially offset by a decrease in card processing and interchange expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits was driven by an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases and growth in the Corporation's staff and new offices in its expansion markets, while the increase in technology was primarily due to year-over-year investments in technology applications aimed at enhancing both customer online banking capabilities, customer call center communications, and in-branch technology delivery channels. The decrease in card processing and interchange expenses related to the changes made by the Corporation to its cardholder rewards program.\n\n\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\n  * Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.3 million, representing a 19.31% effective tax rate, compared to $3.0 million, representing an 19.03% effective tax rate, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $3.4 million, representing a 19.86% effective tax rate, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.2 million, representing an 18.92% effective tax rate compared to $10.6 million, representing a 19.47% effective tax rate, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\n  * Total nonperforming assets were approximately $42.0 million, or 0.70% of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $36.5 million, or 0.62% of total assets, as of June 30, 2024, and $29.3 million, or 0.51% of total assets, as of September 30, 2023, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * The allowance for credit losses measured as a percentage of total loans was 1.02% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.02% as of both June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. In addition, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 117.03% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 130.88% and 169.34% as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to the levels of nonperforming assets, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * The provision for credit losses was $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The $1.3 million increase in the provision expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily a result of higher loan portfolio growth and increased net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.8 million, or 0.25% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and $732 thousand, or 0.06% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $5.4 million, or 0.16% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $2.2 million, or 0.07% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with most of the larger year-to-date charge-offs being as previously disclosed occurring in the first and second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Capital_**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total shareholders’ equity was $606.4 million, representing an increase of $19.7 million, or 3.35% (13.33% annualized), from June 30, 2024 and an increase of $57.2 million, or 10.41%, from September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's retained earnings (net income, partially offset by the common and preferred stock dividends paid) and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio for the past twelve months. The additions to shareholders equity from retained earnings were partially offset by the Corporation's repurchase of its common stock, as discussed above.\n\n\n  * Regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation continue to exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of September 30, 2024, consistent with prior periods.\n\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of common shareholders' equity to total assets was 9.12% compared to 8.99% at June 30, 2024 and 8.57% at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure, was 8.45% compared to 8.30% at June 30, 2024 and 7.86% at September 30, 2023. The increases compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of an increase in retained earnings coupled with a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, as discussed above.1\n\n\n\n**About CNB Financial Corporation**\n\nCNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $6.0 billion.

analysis of the Corporation’s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Corporation’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Corporation’s financial performance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently.

STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURE RULES\nNature of Operations\nCNB Financial Corporation (the \"Corporation\") is headquartered in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, and provides a full range of banking and related services through\nits wholly owned subsidiary, CNB Bank (the \"Bank\"). In addition, the Bank provides wealth and asset management services, including the administration of\ntrusts and estates, retirement plans, and other employee benefit plans as well as a full range of wealth management services. The Bank serves individual and\ncorporate customers and is subject to competition from other financial institutions and intermediaries with respect to these services. In addition to the Bank, the\nCorporation also operates a consumer discount loan and finance business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Holiday Financial Services Corporation\n(\"Holiday\"). The Corporation and its other subsidiaries are subject to examination by federal and state regulators. The Corporation’s market area is primarily\nconcentrated in the Central and Northwest regions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Central and Northeast regions of the State of Ohio, Western\nregion of the State of New York and the Southwest region of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") and in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Because this report is based on an interim period,\ncertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been\ncondensed or omitted.\nIn the opinion of management of the registrant, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of\nthe financial condition and the results of operations for the periods presented. The financial performance reported for the Corporation for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2023 Form\n10-K\"). Certain amounts appearing in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for prior periods may be reclassified to conform with\nthe current presentation. If there are reclassifications, the reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders’ equity as previously reported. Dollar\namounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts.\nUse of Estimates\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and\nassumptions affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the disclosures provided and future results could differ.\nOperating Segments\nWhile the Corporation's Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") monitors the revenue streams of the various products and services, operations are\nmanaged and financial performance is evaluated on a Corporation-wide basis, and operating divisions are aggregated into one as operating results for all\nsegments are similar. Accordingly, all of the financial services operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment.\nGoodwill Assessment\nThe Corporation's policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually on November 30 or on an interim basis if an event triggering impairment may have\noccurred. Management evaluated current conditions and concluded there have been no significant changes in the economic environment or future projections\nsince the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of November 30, 2023 and therefore, believes that there is no impairment as of September 30, 2024.\nManagement will continue to evaluate the economic conditions at future reporting periods for applicable changes.\n8\nTable of Contents\n2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2023\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic\n805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.\" This ASU requires that an acquirer recognize and measure\ncontract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2021-\n08 was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2023 and did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, \"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging—Portfolio Layer Method.\" Under prior guidance,\nentities can apply the last-of-layer hedging method to hedge the exposure of a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets to fair value changes due to\nchanges in interest rates for a portion of the portfolio that is not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults, and other events affecting the timing and\namount of cash flows. ASU 2022-01 expands the last-of-layer method, which permits only one hedge layer, to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed\nportfolio. To reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method is renamed the portfolio layer method. ASU 2022-01 also (i) expands the scope of the portfolio\nlayer method to include non-prepayable financial assets, (ii) specifies eligible hedging instruments in a single-layer hedge, (iii) provides additional guidance on\nthe accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method and (iv) specifies how hedge basis adjustments should be\nconsidered when determining credit losses for the assets included in the closed portfolio. ASU 2022-01 was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2023\nand did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, \"Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.\"\nThis ASU eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDRs\") by creditors. The elimination of the TDRs\nguidance may be adopted prospectively for loan modifications after adoption or on a modified retrospective basis, which would also apply to loans previously\nmodified, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption for changes in the allowance for credit losses. ASU 2022-02\nwas effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2023 and did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nIn July 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-03, \"Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic\n220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Amendments to SEC\nParagraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, SEC Staff Announcement at the March 24, 2022 Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\")\nMeeting, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280—General Revision of Regulation S-X: Income or Loss Applicable to\nCommon Stock.\" This ASU amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for SEC updates pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120; SEC\nStaff Announcement at the March 24, 2022 EITF Meeting; and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280—General Revision of\nRegulation S-X: Income or Loss Applicable to Common Stock. The updates were effective immediately. These updates did not have a material impact on the\nCorporation's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2024\nIn June 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-03, \"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions.\" In this ASU, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The ASU also\nrequires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. This guidance was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2024.\nThese updates did not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-01, \"Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.\" This ASU requires the Corporation to amortize leasehold\nimprovements associated with common control leases over the useful life to the common control group. This guidance is effective for the Corporation on\nJanuary 1, 2024. These updates did not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-02, \"Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.\" In this ASU, these amendments allow the Corporation to elect to account for qualifying tax equity\ninvestments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. This guidance is effective for\nthe Corporation on January 1, 2024.\n9\nTable of Contents\nThese updates did not have a material impact on the Corporation's condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAccounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn August 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-05, \"Business Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement.\"\nASU 2023-05 requires certain joint ventures to apply a new basis of accounting upon formation by recognizing and initially measuring most of their assets and\nliabilities at fair value. The objectives of the amendments are to provide decision-useful information to investors and other allocators of capital in a joint\nventure’s financial statements and also to reduce diversity in practice. ASU 2023-05 should be applied prospectively and is effective for all newly formed joint\nventure entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted, and joint ventures formed prior to the adoption date may elect to\napply the new guidance retrospectively back to their original formation date. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-05 will have on its\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-06, \"Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and\nSimplification Initiative.\" The ASU amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532, \"Disclosure Update and\nSimplification\" that was issued in 2018. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-06 will have on\nits condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280).\" This ASU updates reportable segment\ndisclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each\nreported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. The\nCorporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-07 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740).\" The ASU requires disaggregated information\nabout a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made\navailable for issuance. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718).\" The ASU adds an illustrative example to demonstrate how\nan entity should apply the scope guidance in paragraph 718-10-15-3 to determine whether profits interest and similar awards (\"profits interest awards\") should\nbe accounted for in accordance with Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. The amendment in this ASU should be applied either (1) retrospectively\nto all prior periods presented in the financial statements or (2) prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date at\nwhich the entity first applies the amendments. If the amendments are applied retrospectively, an entity is required to provide the disclosures in paragraphs 250-\n10-50-1 through 50-3 in the period of adoption. If the amendment is applied prospectively, an entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the\nchange in accounting principle. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods.\nEarly adoption is also permitted for interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. If an entity adopts the\namendments in an interim period, it should adopt the amendment as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Corporation is\nevaluating the effect that ASU 2024-01 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, \"Codification Improvements—Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements.\" The ASU\ncontains amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification that remove references to various Concepts Statements. In most instances, the references\nare extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. In other instances, the references were used in prior Concept Statements to provide\nguidance in certain topical areas. The amendment in this ASU should be applied using one of the following transition methods: (1) prospectively to all new\ntransactions recognized on or after the date that the entity first applies the amendments; or (2) retrospectively to the beginning of the earliest comparative\nperiod presented in which the amendments were first applied. An entity should adjust the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate\ncomponents of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position) as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The ASU is effective\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application of the amendment is permitted for\nany fiscal year or interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued, or made available for issuance. If an entity adopts the amendment in\nan interim period, it must adopt the amendment as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Corporation is evaluating the effect\nthat ASU 2024-02 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures.\" The ASU\nrequires disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim\nand annual reporting period an entity: (1) disclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset\namortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas-producing activities (\"DD&A\") (or other amounts of depletion\nexpense) included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within\ncontinuing operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (a)–(e), (2) include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under\ncurrent GAAP in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements, (3) disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant\nexpense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and (4) disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an\nentity’s definition of selling expenses. An entity is not precluded from providing additional voluntary disclosures that may provide investors with additional\ndecision-useful information. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim report periods beginning after December\n15, 2027. Early application of the amendment is permitted. The ASU should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting\nperiods after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Corporation is evaluating\nthe effect that ASU 2024-03 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nSEC Disclosure Rules\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted its final rule under SEC Release no. 33-11275, \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for\nInvestors.\" In April 2024, the SEC stayed the final climate rule pending the completion of judicial review of an Eighth Circuit challenge seeking to vacate the\nrule. This rule would require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The disclosure\nrequirements would apply to the Corporation’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2026. The Corporation is currently evaluating the final rule to determine its\nimpact on the Corporation’s disclosures.\n3.

Based on the results of the assessment, management believes there is no credit related impairment of these debt securities at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\nFor the securities that comprise corporate notes and bonds and the securities that are issued by state and political subdivisions, management monitors publicly\navailable financial information, such as filings with the SEC, in order to evaluate the securities for potential credit impairment. For financial institution issuers,\nmanagement monitors information from quarterly \"call\" report filings that are used to generate Uniform Bank Performance Reports. All other securities that\nwere in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date were reviewed by management, and issuer-specific documents were reviewed as appropriate given\nthe following considerations; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the\nlength of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost, and whether management does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely\nthat it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management concluded the debt securities described in the previous paragraphs were not impaired for\nreasons due to credit quality for the following reasons:\n• There is no indication of any significant deterioration of the creditworthiness of the institutions that issued the securities.\n• All contractual interest payments on the securities have been received as scheduled, and no information has come to management’s attention through\nthe processes previously described which would lead to a conclusion that future contractual payments will not be timely received.\n• The unrealized losses were deemed to be temporary changes in value related to market movements in interest yields.\nThe Corporation does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position before\nrecovery of its amortized cost basis.\nEquity securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCorporate equity securities $ 6,473 $ 5,341\nMutual funds 1,983 2,223\nMoney market funds 303 1,103\nCorporate notes 1,630 634\nTotal $ 10,389 $ 9,301\n14\nTable of Contents\n4.

This increase\nwas primarily driven by growth in the Corporation's loan portfolio in new market areas as well as an increased unemployment rate forecast, partially offset by\nimprovements in the Corporation's historical loss rates, annual updates to the Corporation's loss drivers and assumptions, as well as the impact of net charge-\noffs. Significant uncertainty persists regarding the domestic and global economy due to persistent inflation in certain segments of the U.S. economy, continued\nelevated interest rates, fluctuating levels of consumer confidence, and geopolitical conflicts. Management will continue to proactively evaluate its estimate of\nexpected credit losses as new information becomes available.\nProvision for credit losses was $2.4 million and $6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $1.1 million\nand $4.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Included in the provision for credit losses for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was a provision of $49 thousand and $112 thousand, respectively, related to the allowance for unfunded commitments compared to\n$33 thousand and $148 thousand, provision towards the allowance for unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans receivable on nonaccrual status and loans receivable past due over 89 days still accruing as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNonaccrual With No Loans Receivable Past\nAllowance for Credit Due over 89 Days Still\nNonaccrual Loss Accruing\nFarmland $ 670 $ 670 $ —\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 6,774 1,521 —\nCommercial and Industrial 10,327 10,113 —\nOther construction loans and all land development and other land loans 1,552 99 —\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 268 268 491\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 8,025 6,502 —\nHome equity lines of credit 1,126 1,126 —\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 9,638 9,262 43\nResidential Mortgages secured by junior liens 326 326 —\nOther revolving credit plans 194 194 —\nAutomobile 189 189 —\nOther consumer 766 766 —\nCredit cards — — 132\nTotal $ 39,855 $ 31,036 $ 666\n18\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nNonaccrual With No Loans Receivable Past\nAllowance for Credit Due over 89 Days Still\nNonaccrual Loss Accruing\nFarmland $ 1,083 $ 1,083 $ —\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 2,673 1,488 —\nCommercial and Industrial 7,512 4,389 —\nOther construction loans and all land development and other land loans 1,653 104 —\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 305 305 —\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 9,076 6,716 —\nHome equity lines of credit 940 940 —\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 5,316 4,902 23\nResidential Mortgages secured by junior liens 123 123 —\nOther revolving credit plans 81 81 —\nAutomobile 79 79 —\nOther consumer 798 798 —\nCredit cards — — 32\nTotal $ 29,639 $ 21,008 $ 55\nAll payments received while on nonaccrual status are applied against the principal balance of the loan.

The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measure of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nOccasionally, the Corporation modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant\npayment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit\nlosses.\nIn some cases, the Corporation provides multiple types of concessions on one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted\ninitially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the loans included\nin the \"combination\" columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is\nat least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or an interest rate reduction.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, by class and by type of modification.

The\nCorporation analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk.\nThe Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings:\nSpecial Mention: A loan classified as special mention has a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these\npotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Corporation’s credit position at some future date.\n24\nTable of Contents\nSubstandard: A loan classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral\npledged, if any. The loan has a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by\nthe distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful: A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the\nweaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nThe following tables represent the Corporation's commercial credit risk profile by risk rating.

LEASES\nOperating lease assets represent the Corporation's right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the\nCorporation's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on\nthe present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents the Corporation's incremental borrowing rate at the lease\ncommencement date. Operating lease cost, which is comprised of amortization of the operating lease asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating\nlease liability, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is recorded in net occupancy expense in the condensed consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe Corporation leases certain full-service branch offices, land, and equipment. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the\nbalance sheet. Most leases include one or more options to renew and the exercise of the lease renewal options are at the Corporation's sole discretion. The\nCorporation includes lease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic factors, it is reasonably certain the\nCorporation will exercise the option. Certain lease agreements of the Corporation include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in the consumer\nprice index.\nLeases Classification September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets:\nOperating lease assets Operating lease assets $ 37,419 $ 35,699\nFinance lease assets Premises and equipment, net (1) 161 215\nTotal leased assets $ 37,580 $ 35,914\nLiabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities $ 39,683 $ 37,650\nFinance lease liabilities Accrued interest payable and other liabilities 224 294\nTotal leased liabilities $ 39,907 $ 37,944\n(1) Finance lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe components of the Corporation's net lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nLease Cost Classification 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost Net occupancy expense $ 757 $ 745 $ 2,235 $ 2,224\nVariable lease cost Net occupancy expense 27 27 83 71\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of leased assets Net occupancy expense 18 18 54 54\nInterest on lease liabilities Interest expense - borrowed funds 3 4 9 12\nSublease income (1) Net occupancy expense (24) (20) (72) (66)\nNet lease cost $ 781 $ 774 $ 2,309 $ 2,295\n(1) Sublease income excludes rental income from owned properties.\nThe following table sets forth future minimum rental payments under noncancellable leases with initial terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2024:\nMaturity of Lease Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 Operating Leases (1) Finance Leases Total\n2024 $ 660 $ 26 $ 686\n2025 2,679 105 2,784\n2026 2,668 105 2,773\n2027 2,688 — 2,688\n2028 2,744 — 2,744\nAfter 2028 53,142 — 53,142\nTotal lease payments 64,581 236 64,817\nLess: Interest 24,898 12 24,910\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 39,683 $ 224 $ 39,907\n(1) Operating lease payments include payments related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised and exclude $12.3 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed, but\nnot yet commenced.\nLease terms and discount rates related to the Corporation's lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nLease Term and Discount Rate September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 23.0 23.0\nFinance leases 2.3 3.0\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 4.18 % 4.05 %\nFinance leases 4.49 % 4.49 %\nOther information related to the Corporation's lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was as follows:\nOther Information September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 789 $ 869\n33\nTable of Contents\n6.

In addition, the\nCorporation had $830.0 million and $739.3 million in reciprocal deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n7. BORROWINGS\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had available one $10.0 million unsecured line of credit with an unaffiliated institution.\nBorrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\"SOFR\") plus 2.85%. There were no\nborrowings under the line of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Borrowings\nThe Bank has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\"). The Bank maintains a $250.0 million line-of-credit\n(Open Repo Plus) with the FHLB which is a revolving term commitment available on an overnight basis. The term of this commitment may not exceed 364\ndays and it reprices daily at market rates. Under terms of a blanket collateral agreement with the FHLB, the line-of-credit and long term advances are secured\nby FHLB stock and the Bank pledges its single-family residential mortgage loan portfolio, certain commercial real estate loans, and certain agriculture real\nestate loans as security for any advances.\nTotal loans pledged to the FHLB at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The Bank could obtain\nadvances of up to approximately $1.2 billion from the FHLB at September 30, 2024 and $993.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLB:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOpen Repo borrowing at an interest rate of 5.18% and 5.68% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $ — $ —\nrespectfully. The maximum amount of the Open Repo borrowing available is $250,000.\nTotal $ — $ —\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, municipal deposit letters of credit issued by the FHLB on behalf of the Bank naming applicable municipalities\nas beneficiaries were $156.1 million and $155.7 million, respectively. The letters of credit were utilized in place of securities pledged to the municipalities for\ntheir deposits maintained at the Bank.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFederal Reserve Borrowings\nIn June 2023, the Bank was approved by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the \"Federal Reserve\") for its Borrower-in-Custody (\"BIC\") program. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Bank had borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve BIC program of $240.9 million. Borrowings under the BIC program are\novernight advances with interest chargeable at the discount window (\"primary credit\") borrowing rate. At September 30, 2024, the Bank has pledged certain\nqualifying loans with an unpaid principal balance of $250.7 million and securities with a carrying value of $78.1 million as collateral.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no borrowings from the Federal Reserve BIC program and discount window.\nOther Borrowings\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from unaffiliated institutions under overnight borrowing agreements.\nSubordinated Debentures\nIn 2007, the Corporation issued two $10.0 million floating rate trust preferred securities as part of a pooled offering of such securities. The interest rate on each\noffering was determined quarterly and floated based upon three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 1.55%. Effective September 15, 2023,\nthe interest rate calculation method was revised. The interest rate is now determined quarterly, and floats based on the three-month SOFR plus a credit spread\nadjustment of 0.26161% plus 1.55%. This change reflects the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the reference rate. The all-in rate was 6.76% at September 30,\n2024 and 7.20% at December 31, 2023. The Corporation issued subordinated debentures to the trusts in exchange for the proceeds of the offerings, which\ndebentures represent the sole assets of the trusts. The subordinated debentures must be redeemed no later than 2037. The Corporation may redeem the\ndebentures, in whole or in part, at face value at any time. The Corporation has the option to defer interest payments from time to time for a period not to exceed\nfive consecutive years. Although the trusts are variable interest entities, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, because the trusts are not\nconsolidated with the Corporation, the Corporation does not report the securities issued by the trusts as liabilities. Instead, the Corporation reports as liabilities\nthe subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation and held by the trusts, since the liabilities are not eliminated in consolidation. The trust preferred\nsecurities were designated to qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines.\nSubordinated Notes\nIn June 2021, the Corporation sold $85.0 million aggregate principal amount of its fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes to eligible purchasers in a private\noffering in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the provisions of\nRule 506 of Regulation D thereunder. The notes will mature in June 2031, and initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually\nin arrears, to, but excluding, June 15, 2026, and thereafter to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an\ninterest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month average SOFR plus 2.58%. The net proceeds from the sale were approximately $83.5 million,\nafter deducting offering expenses. These subordinated notes were designed to qualify as Tier 2 capital under the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines and were\ngiven an investment grade rating of BBB- by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. The unamortized debt issuance costs were $0.5 million and $0.7 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n35\nTable of Contents\n8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSome of the Corporation's directors, executive officers, and their related interests had transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. All loan\nand deposit transactions were made on substantially the same terms, such as interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable\ntransactions. In the opinion of management, these transactions do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability nor do they present other unfavorable\nfeatures. It is anticipated that similar transactions will be entered into in the future.\nLoans to principal officers, directors, and their affiliates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nBeginning balance $ 28,295\nNew loans and advances 1,013\nEffect of changes in composition of related parties —\nRepayments (612)\nEnding balance $ 28,696\nLoans to principal officers, directors, and their affiliates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nBeginning balance $ 40,129\nNew loans and advances 1,167\nEffect of changes in composition of related parties 2,860\nRepayments (15,460)\nEnding balance $ 28,696\nDeposits from directors, executive officers, and their affiliates were $12.3 million and $11.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\n9. OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of\ncredit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the\nevent of nonperformance by the other party of the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the\ncontract or notional amount of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies for underwriting all loans, including these commitments and\nconditional obligations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation did not own or trade other financial instruments with significant off-balance sheet risk\nincluding derivatives such as futures, forwards, option contracts and the like, although such instruments may be appropriate to use in the future to manage\ninterest rate risk. See Note 12, \"Derivative Instruments,\" for a description of interest rate derivatives entered into by the Corporation.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The contract or\nnotional amount of these instruments reflects the maximum amount of future payments that the Corporation could be required to pay under the guarantees if\nthere were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration for possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged.\nIn addition, many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe Corporation's maximum obligation to extend credit for loan commitments (unfunded loans and unused lines of credit) and standby letters of credit\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFixed Rate Variable Rate Fixed Rate Variable Rate\nCommitments to extended credit $ 121,344 $ 330,248 $ 111,526 $ 370,437\nUnused lines of credit 23,549 837,256 11,219 789,534\nStandby letters of credit 19,662 2,535 18,649 2,480\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on\nmanagement’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral that is held varies but may include securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and\nequipment, and residential and income-producing commercial properties.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss\ninherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans\nreceivable, modified to take into account the probability of a draw-down on the commitment. The provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is\nincluded in the provision for credit losses on the Corporation's condensed consolidated statements of income. The allowance for unfunded commitments is\nincluded in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Note 4, \"Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the provision for credit losses related to the loan portfolio of the Corporation.\nThe following table presents activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 822 $ 718 $ 759 $ 603\nProvision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments (1) 49 33 112 148\nEnding balance $ 871 $ 751 $ 871 $ 751\n(1) Excludes provision for credit losses related to the loan portfolio.\nInvestments in Small Business Investment Corporation and Community Development Entities\nThe Corporation makes investments in limited partnerships, including certain small business investment corporations and community development entities.\nCapital contributions for investments in small business companies (\"SBIC\") and community development entities (\"CDE\"), reported in FHLB and other\nrestricted stock holdings and investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $22.9 million\nand $21.7 million, respectively. Unfunded capital commitments in investments in SBICs and CDEs totaled $8.6 million and $6.8 million as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nInvestments in Qualified Affordable Housing Project Investments\nThe carrying value of investments in the low income housing partnerships, reported in FHLB and other restricted stock holdings and investments on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $7.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively.

It is the opinion of management the disposition or\nultimate resolution of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows of the Corporation.\n10. STOCK COMPENSATION\nThe Corporation has a stock incentive plan, which is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors and which permits the Corporation to provide\nvarious types of stock-based compensation to its key employees, directors, and/or consultants, including time-based and performance-based shares of restricted\nstock. The Corporation previously maintained the CNB Financial Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, which terminated in accordance with its terms on\nFebruary 10, 2019, and currently maintains the CNB Financial Corporation 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Stock Incentive Plan\"), which was\napproved by the Corporation’s shareholders and became effective on April 16, 2019.\nThe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan provides for up to 507,671 shares of common stock to be awarded in the form of nonqualified options or restricted stock. For\nkey employees, the vesting of time-based restricted stock is one-third, one-fourth, or one-fifth of the granted restricted shares per year, beginning one year after\nthe grant date, with 100% vesting on the third, fourth or fifth anniversary of the grant date, respectively. Stock compensation received by non-employee\ndirectors vests immediately.\nAt September 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock-based compensation awarded under this plan and, except for the time-\nbased and performance-based restricted stock awards disclosed below and in previous filings, no other stock-based compensation was granted during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCompensation expense for the restricted stock awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant on\na straight-line basis. Non-vested restricted stock awards are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital in shareholders’ equity until earned.\nCompensation expense resulting from time-based, performance-based and director restricted stock awards was $471 thousand and $1.8 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $350 thousand and $1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. The total income tax benefit related to the recognized compensation cost of vested restricted stock awards was $99 thousand and $386 thousand\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $74 thousand and $275 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively.\nA summary of changes in time-based unvested restricted stock awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024 follows:\nPer Share Weighted Average\nShares Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at beginning of period 190,038 $ 22.42\nGranted — —\nForfeited (3,345) 22.61\nVested (1,362) 24.02\nUnvested at end of period 185,331 $ 22.41\n38\nTable of Contents\nA summary of changes in time-based unvested restricted stock awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 follows:\nPer Share Weighted Average\nShares Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at beginning of period 124,934 $ 24.09\nGranted 112,828 21.26\nForfeited (8,306) 22.73\nVested (44,125) 24.16\nUnvested at end of period 185,331 $ 22.41\nThe above table excludes 18,029 shares in restricted stock awards that were granted to the Corporation's Board of Directors at a weighted average fair value of\n$21.35 and immediately vested. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was $3.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to non-vested shares granted under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. The fair value of shares vested was $33 thousand and $1.4 million\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $25 thousand and $963 thousand during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nIn addition to the time-based restricted stock disclosed above, the Corporation’s Board of Directors grants performance-based restricted stock awards\n(\"PBRSAs\") to key employees. The number of PBRSAs will depend on certain performance conditions earned over a three year period and are also subject to\nservice-based vesting. In 2024, awards with a maximum of 29,992 shares in aggregate were granted to key employees. In 2023, awards with a maximum of\n23,124 shares in aggregate were granted to key employees. In 2022, awards with a maximum of 13,761 shares in aggregate were granted to key employees.\nIn 2023, the 2021 PBRSAs were fully earned and in 2024, 9,667 shares were fully distributed. The fair value of the shares distributed in 2024 was\n$206 thousand.\n11. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the applicable period, excluding outstanding participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted\naverage number of common shares determined for the basic computation plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares issuable under certain stock\ncompensation plans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding stock options to include in the diluted\nearnings per common share calculations.\nUnvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating\nsecurities and are included in the computation of earnings per common share pursuant to the two-class method. The Corporation has determined that its\noutstanding non-vested time-based restricted stock awards are participating securities.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is shown below:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic earnings per common share computation:\nNet income per condensed consolidated statements of income $ 12,878 $ 12,651 $ 36,285 $ 40,817\nNet earnings allocated to participating securities (101) (70) (291) (222)\nNet earnings allocated to common stock $ 12,777 $ 12,581 $ 35,994 $ 40,595\nDistributed earnings allocated to common stock $ 3,746 $ 3,645 $ 11,036 $ 10,969\nUndistributed earnings allocated to common stock 9,031 8,936 24,958 29,626\nNet earnings allocated to common stock $ 12,777 $ 12,581 $ 35,994 $ 40,595\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, including shares\nconsidered participating securities 20,997 20,969 20,994 21,048\nLess: Average participating securities (155) (109) (162) (109)\nWeighted average shares 20,842 20,860 20,832 20,939\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.61 $ 0.60 $ 1.73 $ 1.94\nDiluted earnings per common share computation:\nNet earnings allocated to common stock $ 12,777 $ 12,581 $ 35,994 $ 40,595\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic earnings per\ncommon share 20,842 20,860 20,832 20,939\nAdd: Dilutive effect of stock compensation 70 40 64 40\nWeighted average shares and dilutive potential common shares 20,912 20,900 20,896 20,979\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.61 $ 0.60 $ 1.72 $ 1.94\n12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOn September 7, 2018, the Corporation executed an interest rate swap agreement with a 5-year term and an effective date of September 15, 2018 in order to\nhedge cash flows associated with $10.0 million of a subordinated trust preferred security that was issued by the Corporation during 2007 and elected cash flow\nhedge accounting for the agreement. The Corporation’s objective in using this derivative is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to\ninterest rate risk. The interest rate swap involves the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments from September 15, 2018 to\nSeptember 15, 2023 without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. The swap expired on September 15, 2023 and was not renewed.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no derivatives were designated as fair value hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\nAdditionally, the Corporation does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as\nhedges.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide information about the amounts and locations of activity related to the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges within\nthe Corporation’s condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30, 2024 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nInterest rate contracts Interest expense –\nsubordinated notes and Other\n$ — debentures $ — income $ —\nFor the Nine Months\nEnded September 30, 2024 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nInterest rate contracts Interest expense –\nsubordinated notes and Other\n$ — debentures $ — income $ —\nFor the Three Months\nEnded September 30, 2023 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nInterest rate contracts Interest expense –\nsubordinated notes and Other\n$ (51) debentures $ (55) income $ —\nFor the Nine Months\nEnded September 30, 2023 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nInterest rate contracts Interest expense –\nsubordinated notes and Other\n$ (119) debentures $ (151) income $ —\n(a) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss on Derivative (Effective Portion), net of tax\n(b) Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (Effective Portion)\n(c) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (Effective Portion)\n(d) Location of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Ineffective Portion and Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing)\n(e) Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative (Ineffective Portion and Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing)\nDerivatives on Behalf of Customers\nThe Corporation entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions\nin which the Corporation enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another\nfinancial institution. In connection with each swap transaction, the Corporation agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest\nrate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. Concurrently, the Corporation agrees to pay another financial\ninstitution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction\nallows the Corporation’s customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. Because the Corporation acts as an intermediary for its customer,\nchanges in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts offset each other and do not impact the Corporation’s results of operations.\nThe Corporation pledged cash collateral to another financial institution with a balance of $1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and $173 thousand as of\nDecember 31, 2023. This balance is included in cash and cash equivalents due from banks on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation may\nrequire its customers to post cash or securities as collateral on its program of back-to-back swaps depending upon the specific facts and circumstances\nsurrounding each loan and individual swap. In addition, certain language is included in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement and\nloan documents where, in default situations, the Corporation is permitted to access collateral supporting the loan relationship to recover any losses suffered on\nthe derivative asset or liability. The Corporation may be required to post additional collateral to swap counterparties in the future in proportion to potential\nincreases in unrealized loss positions. Effective on September 30, 2023 the Corporation amended all of the back-to-back swap contracts to reference the 1-\nmonth SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 11.448 basis points \"Fallback SOFR.\"\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information about the amounts and locations of activity related to the back-to-back interest rate swaps within the Corporation’s\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFair Value\nNotional\nAmount Asset Liability\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 65,748 $ 1,558 (a) $ 1,558 (b)\nDecember 31, 2023 $ 21,302 $ 1,013 (a) $ 1,013 (b)\n(a) Reported in accrued interest receivable and other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets\n(b) Reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nRisk Participation Agreements\nThe Corporation’s existing credit derivatives result from participation in or out of interest rate swaps provided by or to external lenders as part of loan\nparticipation arrangements, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Corporation’s assets or liabilities. Derivatives not designated as hedges are\nnot speculative and result from a service the Corporation provides to certain lenders which participate in loans.\nThe Corporation entered into Risk Participation Agreement (\"RPA\") swaps with other financial institutions related to loans in which the Corporation is a\nparticipant in. The RPA provides credit protection to the financial institution should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the\nfinancial institution. The notional amount of this contingent agreement is $21.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and $21.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation entered into RPA swaps with other financial institutions related to loans in which the Corporation is a participant out. The RPA provides credit\nprotection to the Corporation should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution. The notional amount of\nthis contingent agreement is $25.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and zero as of December 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of the RPAs swaps was $25 thousand and $49 thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is reported in\naccrued interest payable and other liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n13. FAIR VALUE\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use\nin pricing an asset or liability.\nThe Corporation used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value:\nInvestment Securities: The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted\nprices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2), using matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical\ntechnique commonly used to price debt securities that are not actively traded, values debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the\nspecific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). For securities where quoted prices\nor market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3).\n42\nTable of Contents\nLoans Held for Sale: Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is evaluated on a loan-level basis. The fair value of loans held for\nsale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan or other observable market data, such as outstanding\ncommitments from third party investors (Level 2).\nDerivatives: The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). The Corporation's\nderivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are\ndetermined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates,\nprices, and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs\nare actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions, and third-party pricing services.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans: The fair value of individually evaluated loans with specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on\nrecent real estate appraisals prepared by third-parties. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including\ncomparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the\ncomparable sales and income data available. Management also adjusts appraised values based on the length of time that has passed since the appraisal date and\nother factors. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate\ncollateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower's financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on\nmanagement's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the client and\nclient's business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Individually evaluated loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and\nadjusted in accordance with the allowance policy.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024 Using:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nSecurities Available-For-Sale:\nU.S. Government sponsored entities $ 13,087 $ 13,087 $ — $ —\nStates and political subdivisions 94,127 — 94,127 —\nResidential and multi-family mortgage 223,951 — 223,951 —\nCorporate notes and bonds 38,326 — 38,326 —\nPooled SBA 9,474 — 9,474 —\nTotal Securities Available-For-Sale $ 378,965 $ 13,087 $ 365,878 $ —\nInterest Rate swaps $ 1,558 $ — $ 1,558 $ —\nEquity Securities:\nCorporate equity securities $ 6,473 $ 6,473 $ — $ —\nMutual funds 1,983 1,983 — —\nMoney market funds 303 303 — —\nCorporate notes 1,630 — 1,630 —\nTotal Equity Securities $ 10,389 $ 8,759 $ 1,630 $ —\nLiabilities:\nInterest Rate Swaps $ (1,558) $ — $ (1,558) $ —\n43\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Using:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nSecurities Available-For-Sale:\nU.S. Government sponsored entities $ 4,988 $ 4,988 $ — $ —\nStates and political subdivisions 91,809 — 91,809 —\nResidential and multi-family mortgage 191,519 — 191,519 —\nCorporate notes and bonds 43,139 — 43,139 —\nPooled SBA 10,500 — 10,500 —\nTotal Securities Available-For-Sale $ 341,955 $ 4,988 $ 336,967 $ —\nInterest Rate swaps $ 1,013 $ — $ 1,013 $ —\nEquity Securities:\nCorporate equity securities $ 5,341 $ 5,341 $ — $ —\nMutual funds 2,223 2,223 — —\nMoney market funds 1,103 1,103 — —\nCorporate notes 634 — 634 —\nTotal Equity Securities $ 9,301 $ 8,667 $ 634 $ —\nLiabilities:\nInterest Rate Swaps $ (1,013) $ — $ (1,013) $ —\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024 Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCollateral-dependent loans receivable:\nFarmland $ 391 $ — $ — $ 391\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 3,455 — — 3,455\nCommercial and industrial 2,118 — — 2,118\nOther construction loans and all land development loans and other\nland loans 1,203 — — 1,203\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 268 — — 268\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential 6,274 — — 6,274\nHome equity lines of credit 286 — — 286\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 810 — — 810\n44\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nDescription Total (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nCollateral-dependent loans receivable:\nFarmland $ 736 $ — $ — $ 736\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 5,589 — — 5,589\nCommercial and industrial 7,425 — — 7,425\nOther construction loans and all land development loans and other\nland loans 1,299 — — 1,299\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 305 — — 305\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential 7,216 — — 7,216\nHome equity lines of credit 308 — — 308\nResidential mortgages secured by first liens 871 — — 871\nA loan is considered to be a collateral dependent loan when, based on current information and events, the Corporation expects repayment of the financial assets\nto be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the Corporation has determined that the borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty as of the measurement date. The allowance for credit losses is measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of\nexpected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the underlying fair value of the loan’s collateral. For real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral is\ndetermined by third-party appraisals, which are then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral. For this asset\nclass, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. For example, land is generally based\non the sales comparable method while construction is based on the income and/or sales comparable methods. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on\nthe individual assets with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. The Corporation reviews the third-party appraisal for appropriateness\nand may adjust the value downward to consider selling and closing costs. For non-real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral may be determined using\nan appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge,\nchanges in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business.\n45\nTable of

estimates of fair value are based on management’s judgment of the most appropriate factors as of the balance sheet dates, there is no assurance that the\nestimated fair values would have been realized if the assets had been disposed of or the liabilities settled at that date, since market values may differ depending\non various circumstances. The estimated fair values would also not apply to subsequent dates. The fair value of other equity interests is based on the net asset\nvalues provided by the underlying investment partnership. ASU 2015-7 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments\nmeasured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and related disclosures. In addition, other assets and liabilities that are not financial\ninstruments, such as premises and equipment, are not included in the disclosures.\nAlso, non-financial assets such as, among other things, the estimated earnings power of core deposits, the earnings potential of trust accounts, the trained\nworkforce, and customer goodwill, which typically are not recognized on the balance sheet, may have value but are not included in the fair value disclosures.\n47\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion and analysis of the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Corporation is presented to provide insight into management’s\nassessment of financial results. The terms \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refer to CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. The financial condition and results of\noperations of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nThe Corporation’s subsidiary, CNB Bank, provides financial services to individuals and businesses. The Bank franchise's primary market areas are the\nPennsylvania counties of Blair, Cambria, Centre, Clearfield, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. ERIEBANK, a division of the Bank, operates in the\nPennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren and in the Ohio counties of Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, and Lorain. FCBank, a division of the\nBank, operates in the Ohio counties of Crawford, Delaware, Franklin, Knox, Marion, Morrow, and Richland. BankOnBuffalo, a division of the Bank, operates\nin the New York counties of Erie and Niagara. Ridge View Bank, a division of the Bank, operates in the Virginia counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin, New\nRiver Valley, and Roanoke. Impressia Bank, a division of the Bank, operates in the Bank’s primary market areas. Although the Corporation’s strategies, through\nthe Bank, are executed based on the divisions discussed above, the Bank is a single Pennsylvania-chartered bank whereby all divisions of the Bank conduct\ntheir business on a doing business as basis.\nIn addition to the Bank, the Corporation has four other subsidiaries. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains\ninvestments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other\ninsurance products. CNB Risk Management, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, is a captive insurance company that insures against certain risks unique to the\noperations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance\nmarketplace. Holiday Financial Services Corporation, incorporated in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily\ncollateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, included the 2023 Form 10-K, and in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\n1 of this report. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending\nDecember 31, 2024, or any future period.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThis report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial information in its analysis of the\nCorporation’s performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance\ncomparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Corporation’s\nmanagement believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Corporation’s financial performance without the impact of unusual\nitems or events that may obscure trends in the Corporation’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared\nin accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Limitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks\nthat persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures\ndifferently.\nNon-GAAP measures reflected within the discussion below include:\n• Tangible book value per share;\n• Tangible common equity/tangible assets;\n• Net interest margin (fully tax-equivalent basis);\n• Efficiency ratio;\n• Pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\"); and\n• Return on average tangible common equity\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPRIMARY FACTORS USED TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE\nManagement considers return on average assets, return on average equity, return on average tangible common equity, earnings per common share, tangible\nbook value per common share, asset quality, net interest margin, and other metrics as key measures of the financial performance of the Corporation. The\ninterest rate environment will continue to play an important role in the future earnings of the Corporation. To address the challenging interest rate and\ncompetitive environments, the Corporation continues to evaluate, develop and implement strategies necessary to support its ongoing financial performance\nobjectives and future growth goals. Additionally, management frequently evaluates the potential impact of economic and geopolitical events that may have an\nimpact on the credit risk profile of its customers and develops proactive strategies to mitigate such potential impacts on the Corporation’s loan portfolio.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $360.9 million at September 30, 2024, including additional excess liquidity of $282.0 million held at the Federal Reserve,\ncompared to $222.0 million at December 31, 2023. These excess funds, when combined with collective contingent liquidity resources of $4.5 billion including\n(i) available borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other\nthird-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, result in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity\nsources for the Corporation to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances.\nManagement believes the liquidity needs of the Corporation are satisfied primarily by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, customer and brokered\ndeposits, FHLB financing, the portions of the securities and loan portfolios that mature within one year, and other third-party funding channels. The\nCorporation expects that these sources of funds will enable it to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due. In addition to the\nabove noted liquidity sources, the Corporation maintains access to the Federal Reserve discount window.\nSECURITIES\nAFS debt securities and equity securities combined totaled $389.4 million and $351.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the total balance of investments classified as HTM debt securities was $328.2 million compared to $389.0 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation’s objective is to maintain the investment securities portfolio at an appropriate level to balance the earnings and liquidity provided by the\nportfolio. Note 3, \"Securities,\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the composition of the Corporation’s\nsecurities portfolio and the process for evaluating securities for impairment.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of AFS debt securities as of September 30,\n2024. Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%.

The Corporation's strategy given the current environment is to focus on lower risk securities and shorter durations\nthat complement the current portfolio investment ladder, coupled with consistent reinvestment of cash flows to replace lower earning assets.\nThe Corporation monitors the earnings performance and the effectiveness of the liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through meetings of the\nAsset/Liability Committee (\"ALCO\"). The ALCO also reviews and manages interest rate risk for the Corporation. Through active balance sheet management\nand analysis of the securities portfolio, a sufficient level of liquidity is maintained to satisfy depositor requirements and various credit needs of our customers.\nLOANS RECEIVABLE\nNote 4, \"Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides more detail concerning the loan\nportfolio of the Corporation.\nAt September 30, 2024, loans, excluding the impact of syndicated loans, totaled $4.5 billion, representing an increase of $162.7 million, or 3.73% year to date\nincrease (4.98% annualized), from December 31, 2023. The increase in loans was primarily driven by qualitative growth in commercial real estate coupled with\ngrowth in commercial and industrial and residential real estate in the Columbus, Erie and Roanoke markets and continued new relationship growth in the\nCorporation's recent expansion market of Cleveland, and growth in the Corporation's Private Banking division with notable activity in the Roanoke market.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, the Corporation's condensed consolidated balance sheet reflected a decrease in syndicated lending balances of $39.2 million compared\nto December 31, 2023, primarily resulting from scheduled paydowns or early payoffs of certain syndicated loans. The syndicated loan portfolio totaled $69.5\nmillion, or 1.51% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $108.7 million, or 2.43% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The Corporation is closely\nmanaging the level of its syndicated loan portfolio while it focuses more resources on organic loan growth from its in-market customer relationships.\nLoan Origination/Risk Management\nThe Corporation has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk.\nManagement reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing\nmanagement with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming, and potential\nproblem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. The Corporation has not\nunderwritten any hybrid loans, payment option loans, or low documentation/no documentation loans. Variable rate loans are generally underwritten at the fully\nindexed rate. Loan underwriting policies and procedures have not changed materially between any periods presented. As discussed more fully above,\nsyndicated loan purchases are underwritten utilizing the same process as the Corporation’s originated loans.\nThe Corporation continues to explore the credit and reputational risks associated with climate change and their potential impact on the foregoing, while closely\nmonitoring regulatory developments on climate risk. This includes, among other things, researching and developing a formalized approach to considering\nclimate change related risks in the Corporation's underwriting processes. This approach will be impacted, in part, by the accessibility and reliability of both\ncustomer climate risk data and climate risk data in general. One of the objectives of these efforts is to enable the Corporation to better understand the climate\nchange related risks associated with the Corporation's customers' business activities and to be able to monitor their response to those risks and their ultimate\nimpact on the Corporation's customers.\nLoan Portfolio Profile\nAs part of its lending policy and risk management activities, the Corporation tracks lending exposure by industry classification and type to determine potential\nrisks associated with industry concentrations, and whether any risk issues could lead to additional credit loss exposure. In the current post-pandemic and\ninflationary economic environment, the Corporation has evaluated its exposure to the office, hospitality, and multifamily industries within its commercial real\nestate portfolio. Even given the Corporation’s historically sound underwriting protocols and high credit quality ratings for borrowers in these industries, the\nCorporation monitors numerous relevant sensitivity elements at both underwriting and through and beyond the funding period, including projects occupancy,\nloan-to-value, absorption and cap rates, debt service coverage and covenant compliance, and developer/lessor financial strength both in the project and\nglobally. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had the following key metrics related to its office, hospitality and multifamily portfolios:\n• Commercial office loans\n◦ There were 114 outstanding loans, totaling $117.0 million, or 2.55% of the Corporation loans outstanding;\n◦ There were no nonaccrual commercial office loans at September 30, 2024;\n◦ There was one past due commercial office loan that totaled $214 thousand, or 0.18% of total commercial office loans outstanding at\nSeptember 30, 2024; and\n◦ The average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $1.0 million.\n• Commercial hospitality loans\n◦ There were 173 outstanding loans, totaling $320.6 million, or 6.98% of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n◦ There were no nonaccrual commercial hospitality loans at September 30, 2024;\n◦ There were no past due commercial hospitality loans at September 30,2024; and\n◦ The average outstanding balance per commercial hospitality loan was $1.9 million.\n• Commercial multifamily loans\n◦ There were 225 outstanding loans, totaling $349.1 million, or 7.60% of total Corporation loans outstanding;\n◦ There was one nonaccrual commercial multifamily loan that totaled $268 thousand, or 0.08% of total multifamily loans outstanding. The one\ncustomer relationship did not have a related specific loss reserve at September 30, 2024;\n◦ There were two past due commercial multifamily loans that totaled $760 thousand, or 0.22% of total commercial multifamily loans\noutstanding at September 30, 2024; and\n◦ The average outstanding balance per commercial multifamily loan was $1.6 million.\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarize the geographic region (based upon metropolitan statistical areas) in which the commercial office, hospitality and multifamily\nloans were originated as of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCommercial Office\nGeographic Region:\nBuffalo, NY 31.73 %\nCleveland, OH 29.69\nCincinnati, OH 9.50\nColumbus, OH 8.15\nAll other geographical regions 20.93\nTotal Commercial Office 100.00 %\nCommercial Hospitality\nGeographic Region:\nBuffalo, NY 19.60 %\nColumbus, OH 18.53\nPittsburgh, PA 16.59\nCleveland, OH 8.32\nAll other geographical regions 36.96\nTotal Commercial Hospitality 100.00 %\nCommercial Multifamily\nGeographic Region:\nCleveland, OH 34.65 %\nBuffalo, NY 23.18\nColumbus, OH 22.76\nAll other geographical regions 19.41\nTotal Commercial Multifamily 100.00 %\nThe Corporation had no commercial office, hospitality or multifamily loan relationships considered by the banking regulators to be a high volatility\ncommercial real estate credit (\"HVCRE\").\n52\nTable of Contents\nMaturities and Sensitivities of Loans Receivable to Changes in Interest Rate\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of the Corporation's loans receivable at September 30, 2024.

In addition, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 117.03% at September 30, 2024, compared to 154.63%\nat December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to two relationships. The first relationship was an owner-occupied commercial\nreal estate relationship totaling $4.6 million with a specific reserve balance of $1.2 million and the second was a commercial relationship (consisting of various\nloan types) totaling $7.9 million with a specific reserve of $2.2 million. Management does not believe there is risk of significant additional loss exposures\nbeyond the specific reserves related to these loan relationships.\nThe Corporation has established written lending policies and procedures that require underwriting standards, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards\nto be met prior to funding a loan. Subsequent to the funding of a loan, ongoing review of credits is required. Credit reviews are performed quarterly by an\noutsourced loan review firm and cover approximately 65% of the commercial loan portfolio on an annual basis. In addition, the external independent loan\nreview firm reviews past due loans and all significant classified assets and nonaccrual loans annually.\nPotential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of a\nborrower to continue to comply with contractual repayment terms because of the borrower’s potential operating or financial difficulties. Management monitors\nthese \"watchlist\" loans monthly to determine potential losses within the commercial loan portfolio. The \"watchlist\" is comprised of all credits risk rated special\nmention, substandard and doubtful.\n54\nTable of Contents\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe amount of each allowance for credit losses account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments\nconsidering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.\nRelevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit\nloss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current\nportfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant internal and external factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and\ninformation available, the ultimate adequacy of the Corporation's allowance for credit losses account is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the\nCorporation's control, including the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates, and the view of the regulatory\nauthorities toward classification of assets. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is subject to a formal analysis by the Credit Administration and\nFinance Departments of the Corporation. For additional information regarding the Corporation's accounting policies related to credit losses, refer to Note 1,\n\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 4, \"Loans Receivable and Allowance\nfor Credit Losses\" to these condensed consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report.\nThe tables below provide an allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans receivable by loan portfolio segment at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance for credit losses to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments.\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRatio of Allowance\nPercent of Loans in Allocated to Loans\nAmount of Allowance Each Category to Total Total Loans Receivable in Each\nAllocated Loans Receivable Receivable Category\nFarmland $ 162 0.7 % $ 31,820 0.51 %\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 5,222 11.6 531,499 0.98\nAgricultural production and other loans to farmers 7 — 1,733 0.40\nCommercial and Industrial 7,162 15.7 719,441 1.00\nObligations (other than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions 1,497 3.1 142,423 1.05\nOther loans 306 0.6 26,132 1.17\nOther construction loans and all land development and other land loans 2,658 6.3 288,628 0.92\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 1,875 8.9 408,469 0.46\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 11,513 22.1 1,016,001 1.13\n1-4 Family Construction 189 0.5 24,599 0.77\nHome equity lines of credit 982 3.4 157,797 0.62\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 9,133 22.0 1,012,020 0.90\nResidential Mortgages secured by junior liens 1,365 2.2 100,013 1.36\nOther revolving credit plans 960 0.9 41,630 2.31\nAutomobile 298 0.5 22,280 1.34\nOther consumer 2,905 1.2 53,556 5.42\nCredit cards 117 0.3 13,574 0.86\nOverdrafts 293 — 293 100.00\nTotal $ 46,644 100.0 % $ 4,591,908 1.02 %\n55\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023 (1)\nRatio of Allowance\nPercent of Loans in Allocated to Loans\nAmount of Allowance Each Category to Total Total Loans Receivable in Each\nAllocated Loans Receivable Receivable Category\nFarmland $ 138 0.8 % $ 33,485 0.41 %\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 4,131 11.5 511,910 0.81\nAgricultural production and other loans to farmers 7 — 1,652 0.42\nCommercial and Industrial 9,500 16.3 726,442 1.31\nObligations (other than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions 2,627 3.4 152,201 1.73\nOther loans 389 0.6 25,507 1.53\nOther construction loans and all land development and other land loans 2,830 7.6 340,358 0.83\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 1,251 6.8 305,697 0.41\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 9,783 22.0 984,033 0.99\n1-4 Family Construction 191 0.6 28,055 0.68\nHome equity lines of credit 844 2.9 130,700 0.65\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 8,274 22.5 1,005,335 0.82\nResidential Mortgages secured by junior liens 1,487 2.0 91,240 1.63\nOther revolving credit plans 977 1.0 42,877 2.28\nAutomobile 360 0.6 25,315 1.42\nOther consumer 2,656 1.1 51,592 5.15\nCredit cards 95 0.3 11,785 0.81\nOverdrafts 292 — 292 100.00\nTotal $ 45,832 100.0 $ 4,468,476 1.03 %\n(1) As previously disclosed in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, revisions were made to the amount of allowance allocated and total loans receivable columns disclosure as of\nDecember 31, 2023 to reflect the revisions for the applicable portfolio segments.\nThe allowance for credit losses measured as a percentage of total loans receivable was 1.02% as of September 30, 2024 and 1.03% as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation's allowance for credit losses is influenced by loan volumes, risk rating migration, delinquency status and other internal and external conditions\ninfluencing loss expectations, such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions and other external factors.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased $812 thousand. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the\nCorporation's loan portfolio in new market areas as well as an increased unemployment rate forecast, partially offset by improvements in the Corporation's\nhistorical loss rates, annual updates to the Corporation's loss drivers and assumptions, as well as the impact of net charge-offs. Significant uncertainty persists\nregarding the domestic and global economy due to persistent inflation in certain segments of the U.S. economy, continued elevated interest rates, fluctuating\nlevels of consumer confidence, and geopolitical conflicts. Management will continue to proactively evaluate its estimate of expected credit losses as new\ninformation becomes available.\nNote 4, \"Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses,\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements provides further disclosure of loan balances\nby portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n56\nTable of Contents\nAdditional information related to provision for credit loss expense and net charge-offs and recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nis presented in the tables below.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRatio of Annualized\nProvision (Benefit) Net Net (Charge-Offs)\nfor Credit Losses on (Charge-Offs) Average Loans Recoveries to Average\nLoans Receivable (1) Recoveries Receivable Loans Receivable\nFarmland $ 8 $ — $ 32,621 — %\nOwner-occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 194 28 540,032 0.02\nAgricultural production and other loans to farmers (1) — 1,647 —\nCommercial and Industrial 637 (588) 702,372 (0.33)\nObligations (other than securities and leases) of states and political subdivisions (1,057) — 152,715 —\nOther loans (97) — 27,805 —\nOther construction loans and all land development and other land loans (456) — 344,144 —\nMultifamily (5 or more) residential properties 465 — 343,867 —\nNon-owner occupied, nonfarm nonresidential properties 1,775 20 974,026 0.01\n1-4 Family Construction 42 — 21,331 —\nHome equity lines of credit (54) 1 149,825 —\nResidential Mortgages secured by first liens 213 (14) 1,015,773 (0.01)\nResidential Mortgages secured by junior liens (233) — 98,821 —\nOther revolving credit plans 42 (16) 42,069 (0.15)\nAutomobile 38 (27) 22,421 (0.48)\nOther consumer 517 (414) 52,786 (3.12)\nCredit cards 94 (80) 14,201 (2.24)\nOverdrafts 205 (130) 246 (210.23)\nTotal $ 2,332 $ (1,220) $ 4,536,702 (0.11)%\n(1) Excludes provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments.

The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan\nrequests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet\nits current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds.\nThe Corporation’s expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and thereafter consist of withdrawals by depositors,\ncredit commitments to borrowers, shareholder dividends, share repurchases, operating expenses, and capital expenditures that are pursuant to the Corporation's\nstrategic initiatives. The Corporation expects to satisfy these short-term and long-term cash requirements through deposit growth, principal and interest\npayments from loans and investment securities, maturing loans and investment securities, as well as by maintaining access to wholesale funding sources.\nThe objective of the Corporation's liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Corporation's\noperations and to meet cash obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Corporation seeks to achieve this objective and\nensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix\nand time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on its balance sheet. The Corporation's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise\nadditional funds as needed in the wholesale markets.\nAsset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash,\ninterest-bearing deposits in banks, including the Federal Reserve, and AFS debt securities. Liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which\ninclude core deposits, correspondent banks and other wholesale funding sources.\nThe Corporation's liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed\nappropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in the Corporation's asset/liability management process. The Corporation regularly models\nliquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or potential funding shortfalls resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial\nmarkets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into the Corporation's\ncontingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of its liquidity needs.\n60\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s cash and cash equivalents position was approximately $361.0 million, including liquidity of $282.0 million held at\nthe Federal Reserve. These excess funds, when combined with $4.5 billion in (i) available borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve, and (ii)\navailable unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from\ncorrespondent banks, result in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation to be approximately 5.0 times the estimated amount of\nadjusted uninsured deposit balances discussed above.\nThe following table summarizes the Corporation's net available liquidity and borrowing capacities as of September 30, 2024:\nNet Available\nFHLB borrowing capacity (1) $ 1,217,551\nFederal Reserve borrowing capacity (2) 448,358\nBrokered deposits (3) 1,978,095\nOther third-party funding channels (3) (4) 843,201\nTotal net available liquidity and borrowing capacity $ 4,487,205\n(1) Availability contingent on the FHLB activity-based stock ownership requirement\n(2) Includes access to discount window and BIC program\n(3) Availability contingent on internal borrowing guidelines\n(4) Availability contingent on correspondent bank approvals at time of borrowing\nAs of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's liquidity,\ncapital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material\nadverse effect on the Corporation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation has entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer\nto the accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of September\n30, 2024. The Corporation’s material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 consist of (i) long-term borrowings - Note 7, \"Borrowings,\" (ii)\noperating leases - Note 5, \"Leases,\" (iii) time deposits with stated maturity dates - Note 6, \"Deposits,\" and (iv) commitments to extend credit and standby letters\nof credit - Note 9, \"Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nShareholders’ Equity, Capital Ratios and Metrics\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s total shareholders’ equity was $606.4 million, representing an increase of $35.1 million, or 6.15%, from\nDecember 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's retained earnings (net income, partially offset by the common and preferred dividends\npaid).\nThe Corporation has complied with the standards of capital adequacy mandated by government regulations. Bank regulators have established \"risk-based\"\ncapital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios. A\nweight category (0% for the lowest risk assets and increasing for each tier of higher risk assets) is assigned to each asset on the balance sheet.\n61\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024 all of the Corporation's capital ratios exceeded regulatory \"well-capitalized\" levels. The Corporation's capital ratios and book value\nper common share at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal risk-based ratio 16.06 % 15.99 %\nTier 1 risk-based ratio 13.30 % 13.20 %\nCommon equity tier 1 ratio 11.64 % 11.49 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio 10.59 % 10.54 %\nCommon shareholders' equity/total assets 9.12 % 8.93 %\nTangible common equity/tangible assets (1) 8.45 % 8.22 %\nBook value per common share $ 26.13 $ 24.57\nTangible book value per common share (1) $ 24.03 $ 22.46\n(1) Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets and preferred equity from the calculation of shareholders’ equity. Tangible assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of total\nassets. Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. The Corporation believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to\ninvestors that is useful in understanding its financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled\nmeasures calculated by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Corporation's pre-tax net unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled approximately $62.5\nmillion, or 10.30% of total shareholders' equity, compared to $82.2 million, or 14.40% of total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2023. The change in\nunrealized losses was primarily due to changes in the yield curve during the first, second and third quarters of 2024 compared to 2023, relative to the\nCorporation's scheduled bond maturities. Importantly, all regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation would exceed regulatory \"well-capitalized\" levels as of\nboth September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 if the net unrealized losses at the respective dates were fully recognized. Additionally, the Corporation\nmaintained $102.0 million of liquid funds at its holding company, which more than covers the $62.5 million in unrealized losses on investments held primarily\nin its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, as an immediately available source of contingent capital to be down-streamed to the Bank, if necessary.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELDS\nThe loans receivable categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the\nallowance for credit losses for loans receivable. The allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit\nmonitoring procedures.

The\nCorporation’s earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $12.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. The increase in diluted earnings per\nshare comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in non-interest\nincome, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense.\nAnnualized return on average equity was 9.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.80% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n11.07% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Corporation's efficiency ratio was 66.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 67.00% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 65.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.26%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income was $47.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $47.2 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. When comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, the increase in net interest income of $250 thousand, or 0.53%, was primarily due\nto an increase in the Corporation's interest income as a result of the increase in total loans outstanding quarter over quarter, partially offset by targeted interest-\nbearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit relationship retention and new deposit growth in the Corporation's markets.\nNet interest margin was 3.43% and 3.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully\ntax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.42% and 3.53%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe yield on earning assets of 5.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 35 basis points from September 30, 2023, primarily as a result\nof the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nManagement believes the charges to the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were appropriate and the allowance for\ncredit losses was adequate to absorb current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTotal non-interest income was $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $7.9 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to\nhigher pass-through income from small business investment companies and net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was $38.8 million, compared to $36.9 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of higher salaries and benefits driven by costs for\npersonnel added for new offices in expansion markets, an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases, increases in health insurance costs, and\ncontractual renewal increases in the Corporation's investments in technology applications. In addition, card processing and interchange expense for the third\nquarter of 2024 was $1.2 million, or 53.24% of card processing and interchange income, compared to $1.2 million, or 57.53% of card processing and\ninterchange income for the third quarter of 2023.\n67\nTable of Contents\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nIncome tax expense was $3.3 million, representing a 19.31% effective tax rate, compared to $3.4 million, representing a 19.86% effective tax rate for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n68\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOVERVIEW\nEarnings were $36.3 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to earnings of $40.8 million, or $1.94 per\ndiluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As previously noted, the decrease in diluted earnings per share comparing the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the rise in deposit costs year over year.\nAnnualized return on average equity was 9.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.74% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 10.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n12.23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Corporation's efficiency ratio was 67.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.26% for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP ratio, was 66.34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.60%\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income was $138.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $142.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease of $3.7 million, or 2.61%, was due to loan growth and the benefits of the impact of higher interest rates resulting in greater income on\nvariable-rate loans, coupled with a higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, being more than offset by an increase in the\nCorporation's interest expense as a result of targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit growth and retention.\nNet interest margin was 3.40% and 3.66% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent\nbasis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.38% and 3.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe yield on earning assets of 5.89% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 41 basis points from September 30, 2023, primarily as a result\nof the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The $1.5 million increase in the provision expense for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily a result of the increased net loan charge-offs and higher loan growth.\nManagement believes the charges to the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were appropriate and the allowance for credit\nlosses was adequate to absorb current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nTotal non-interest income was $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $24.2 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs coupled with an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on equity\nsecurities.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total non-interest expense was $112.2 million, compared to $106.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase of $5.3 million, or 4.96%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in salaries\nand benefits and technology expenses, partially offset by a decrease in card processing and interchange expenses. In addition, other non-interest expenses\nincreased primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to annual merit increases and growth in the Corporation's staff and new offices in its expansion\nmarkets, while the increase in technology was primarily due to year-over-year investments in technology applications aimed at enhancing both customer online\nbanking capabilities, customer call center communications, and in-branch technology delivery channels. The decrease in card processing and interchange\nexpenses related to the changes made by the Corporation to its cardholder rewards program.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nIncome tax expense was $9.2 million, representing an 18.92% effective tax rate, compared to $10.6 million, representing a 19.47% effective tax rate for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in its condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Corporation enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include\ncommitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in\nexcess of the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 9, \"Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and\nContingencies,\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Corporation’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the financial services industry.\nAccounting and reporting practices for the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business\ncombinations, including the associated goodwill and intangibles that was recorded, required the use of material estimates. Application of assumptions different\nthan those used by management could result in material changes in the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations. Note 1, \"Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\" and Note 3, \"Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\" of the 2023 Form 10-K provide additional detail with regard\nto the Corporation’s accounting for the allowance for credit losses and loans receivable.

QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned \"Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could\nAffect Future Results\" included in this report, and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report.\nAs a financial institution, the Corporation's primary source of market risk exposure is interest rate risk, which influences fluctuations in the Corporation's future\nearnings due to changes in interest rates. This risk is closely correlated to the repricing characteristics of the Corporation's portfolio of assets and liabilities,\nwith each asset or liability repricing either at maturity or during the instrument's life cycle.\nThe Corporation’s interest rate risk measurement philosophy focuses on maintaining an appropriate balance between the theoretical and the practical, especially\ngiven that the primary objective of the Corporation’s overall asset/liability management process is to assess the level of interest rate risk in the Corporation’s\nbalance sheet. Therefore, the Corporation models a set of interest rate scenarios capturing the financial effects of a range of plausible rate scenarios. The\ncollective impact of these scenarios is designed to enable the Corporation to understand the nature and extent of its sensitivity to interest rate changes. Doing so\nnecessitates an assessment of rate changes over varying time horizons and of varying/sufficient degrees such that the impact of embedded options within the\nbalance sheet are sufficiently examined.\nThe Corporation has designed its interest rate risk measurement activities to include the following core elements: (i) interest rate ramps and shocks, (ii) parallel\nand non-parallel yield curve shifts, and (iii) a set of alternative rate scenarios, the nature of which change based upon prevailing market conditions.\nThe Corporation’s primary tools in managing Interest Rate Risk (\"IRR\") are income simulation models. The income simulation models are utilized to quantify\nthe potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings and to identify expected earnings trends given longer-term rate cycles. Standard gap reports are also\nutilized to provide supporting detailed information.\nThe Corporation also recognizes that a sustained environment of higher/lower interest rates will affect the underlying value of the Corporation’s assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet instruments since the present value of their future cash flows (and the cash flows themselves) change when interest rates\nchange.\nIRR considerations include inherent assumptions and estimates, including the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, prepayments on\namortizing assets, non-maturing deposit sensitivity, and loan and deposit pricing. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty due to the timing, magnitude,\nand frequency of rate changes, market conditions, and management strategies.\nThe following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or \"shock,\" in the\nyield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Corporation’s projected net interest income over the next 12 months. This\nsimulation assumes that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months. The changes to net interest income\nshown below are in compliance with the Corporation’s policy guidelines.\n% Change in Net Interest Income\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n+300 basis points (0.1)% 2.6%\n+200 basis points 0.3% 3.8%\n+100 basis points 0.3% 4.6%\n-100 basis points (0.6)% (3.8)%\n-200 basis points (0.6)% (6.5)%\n-300 basis points (1.4)% (12.8)%\nAt September 30, 2024, the Corporation has approximately $2.3 billion in outstanding loans receivable balances that are rate sensitive balances over the next\ntwelve months.\n75\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Corporation’s management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Corporation’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, has carried out an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and\nRule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,\nmanagement, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Corporation’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that all material information required to be disclosed in reports the Corporation\nfiles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.\nThere was no significant change in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that\nhas materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThere are no pending legal proceedings to which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which any of their properties is the subject, except\nordinary routine proceedings which are incidental to the business.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nThe following table provides information with respect to any purchase of shares of the Corporation’s common stock made by or on behalf of the Corporation\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nMaximum Number of\nTotal Number of Shares Shares that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Shares Average Price Paid per Common Purchased as Part of Publicly Purchased Under the Plans or\nPeriod Purchased Share (2) Announced Plans or Programs Programs (1)\nJuly 1 – 31, 2024 — $ — — 500,000\nAugust 1 – 31, 2024 — — — 500,000\nSeptember 1 – 30, 2024 — — — 500,000\nTotal — $ — — 500,000\n(1) On June 12, 2024, the Corporation received acknowledgement from the Federal Reserve of the Corporation’s 2024 Common Share Repurchase Program (the \"2024 Plan\"). The Corporation’s Board of Directors previously\napproved the 2024 Plan, subject to the Federal Reserve Bank's response, authorizing the repurchase from time to time by the Corporation of up to 500,000 shares of the Corporation’s common stock, provided that the aggregate\npurchase price of shares of common stock repurchased does not exceed $15,000,000. Pursuant to the 2024 Plan, repurchase of common stock, if any, are authorized to be made during the period beginning on June 12, 2024 (the\ndate on which the Corporation received acknowledgement from the Federal Reserve Bank) through and including May 14, 2025, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as will\ncomply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to compliance with any material agreement to which the Corporation is a party.\nDepending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended without prior notice. As of September 30, 2024, there were 500,000 shares remaining for repurchase under the 2024 Plan.\n(2) The aggregate purchase price and weighted average price per share does not include the effect of excise tax expense incurred on net stock repurchases.\nAdditionally, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, certain employees surrendered shares of common stock owned by them to satisfy their statutory\nminimum U.S. federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of shares of restricted common stock issued under the CNB Financial Corporation\n2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nDividend Restrictions\nThe Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends by the Corporation depends upon cash\ndividend payments to the Corporation by the Bank, which is our primary source of revenue and cash flow.\nAs a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania\nBanking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and\nother cash flow requirements.\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank and the Corporation may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above\nregulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate\nlevel would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become\nundercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding\ncompanies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit\nbanks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice.\n77\nTable of Contents\nThe amount and timing of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon business conditions and regulatory requirements.\nThe Board of Directors has the discretion to change the dividend at any time for any reason. The Board of Directors presently intends to continue the policy of\npaying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, the Corporation's financial condition and\noperating results and other factors, including applicable government regulations and policies.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Corporation’s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or\nwritten plan for the purchase or sale of Corporation securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any \"non-\nRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.\"\n78\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6.
