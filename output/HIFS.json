          "content": "PRESS RELEASE\nFROM: Robert H. Gaughen, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nHingham Institution for Savings\nHingham, MA (NASDAQ: HIFS)\nDATE: April 12, 2024\nCONTACT: Patrick R. Gaughen, President and Chief Operating Officer (781) 783-1761\nHINGHAM REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS (NASDAQ: HIFS), Hingham, Massachusetts\nannounced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nEarnings\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $6,868,000 or $3.17 per share basic and $3.13\nper share diluted, as compared to $8,510,000 or $3.96 per share basic and $3.87 per share diluted for\nthe same period last year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the first quarter of\n2024 was 6.63%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.63%, as compared to 8.67% and\n0.82% for the same period last year. Net income per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2024\ndecreased by 19% compared to the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which represents net income excluding the\nafter-tax gains on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, was $2,213,000 or $1.02 per share\nbasic and $1.01 per share diluted, as compared to $5,744,000 or $2.67 per share basic and $2.61 per\nshare diluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for\nthe first quarter of 2024 was 2.14% and the annualized core return on average assets was 0.20%, as\ncompared to 5.85% and 0.56% for the same period last year. Core net income per share (diluted) for\nthe first quarter of 2024 decreased by 61% over the same period in 2023.\nSee Page 9 for a Non-GAAP reconciliation between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(“GAAP”) net income and core net income. In calculating core net income, the Bank did not make\nany adjustments other than those relating to after-tax gains on equity securities, realized and\nunrealized. In the first quarter of 2024, both net income and core net income were positively\nimpacted by lower income tax expense driven by excess tax benefit associated with the exercise of\nstock options and the revision of income tax estimates.\nPage 1 of 9\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased to $4.529 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 4% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 8% growth from March 31, 2023.\nNet loans increased to $3.938 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 2% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 7% growth from March 31, 2023. Origination activity was concentrated in the\nBoston and Washington D.C. markets and remained focused on stabilized multifamily commercial\nreal estate and multifamily construction. The Bank continues to evaluate new opportunities in the\nSan Francisco market, where interest in acquisitions and refinancing activity from the Bank’s\ncustomers began to pick up in early 2024. As noted below, asset quality remained strong.\nRetail and business deposits were $1.893 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 7% annualized\ngrowth year-to-date and a 5% decline from March 31, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included\nin retail and business deposits, were $347.4 million at March 31, 2024, representing 10% annualized\ngrowth year-to-date and an 8% decline from March 31, 2023.\nGrowth in non-interest bearing and money market balances reflected the Bank’s focus on developing\nand deepening deposit relationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit customers.\nInvestments in new relationship managers in late 2023, combined with changes to our marketing\napproach, began to show some initial results. The Bank also added a new relationship manager in its\nSpecialized Deposit Group in San Francisco during the quarter, as well as a specialist that supports\nthe delivery of cash management services to our commercial customers. The Bank continues to\nrecruit actively for talented retail and commercial bankers in Boston, Washington, and San Francisco,\nparticularly as respected competitors have exited these markets or merged with larger regional banks.\nThe stability of the Bank’s balance sheet, as well as full and unlimited deposit insurance through the\nBank’s participation in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund, continues to be appealing to\ncustomers in times of uncertainty.\nWholesale funds, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, brokered deposits, and\nlisting service deposits were $2.185 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 1% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 22% growth from March 31, 2023, as the Bank continued to manage its wholesale\nfunding mix to optimize the cost of funds while adding duration where appropriate. Wholesale\ndeposits, which include brokered and listing service time deposits, were $500.4 million at March 31,\n2024, representing 10% annualized growth year-to-date and a 6% decline from March 31, 2023.\nBorrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $1.685 billion at March 31, 2024,\nrepresenting a 2% annualized decline from December 31, 2023, and 33% growth from March 31,\n2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank maintained an additional $677.8 million in immediately\navailable borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Federal Reserve\nBank, in addition to $373.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nBook value per share was $190.07 as of March 31, 2024, representing a 3% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 4% growth from March 31, 2023. In addition to the increase in book value per\nshare, the Bank declared $2.52 in dividends per share since March 31, 2023.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Bank declared a regular cash dividend of $0.63 per share. This dividend will\nbe paid on May 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 6, 2024. This was the Bank’s 121st\nconsecutive quarterly dividend.\nThe Bank has also generally declared special cash dividends in each of the last twenty-nine years,\nPage 2 of 9\ntypically in the fourth quarter, but did not declare a special dividend in 2023. The Bank sets the level\nof the special dividend based on the Bank’s capital requirements and the prospective return on other\ncapital allocation options, particularly the incremental return on capital from new loan originations.\nThis may result in special dividends, if any, significantly above or below the regular quarterly\ndividend. Future regular and special dividends will be considered by the Board of Directors on a\nquarterly basis.\nOperational Performance Metrics\nThe net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 4 basis points to 0.85%, as\ncompared to 0.89% in the quarter ended December 31, 2023. It was stable on a monthly basis\nthroughout the quarter. This was primarily the result of an increase in the cost of interest-bearing\nliabilities, driven primarily by an increase in the cost of the Bank’s wholesale funding sources and\nhigher rates on the Bank’s retail and commercial deposits, partially offset by an increase in the yield\non loans from the prior quarter. The increase in the yield on loans was driven by both new loan\noriginations at higher rates and the repricing of existing adjustable rate loans. The pace of net interest\nmargin compression slowed substantially as compared to prior quarters. The net interest margin\nappears to be stabilizing at this point, as short-term market rates have remained stable, the pace of\nincrease in the Bank’s deposit costs has slowed or reversed in some products, and asset yields\ncontinue to climb slowly and sustainably.\nThe net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 decreased 61 basis points to 0.85%, as\ncompared to 1.46% for the same period last year. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the\ncost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the prior year. This was driven primarily by the\nrepricing of the Bank’s funding sources. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was\npartially offset by a higher yield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the\ninterest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, a higher Federal Home Loan Bank\nof Boston stock dividend and an increase in the yield on loans.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the first quarter. At March 31, 2024,\nnon-performing assets totaled 0.04% of total assets, compared to 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and\n0.01% at March 31, 2023. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled\n0.04% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 0.01% at March 31, 2023.\nThe Bank did not record any charge-offs in the first three months of 2024 or 2023. All\nnon-performing assets and loans cited above were and are residential, owner-occupant loans.\nThe Bank did not have any delinquent or non-performing commercial real estate loans as of March\n31, 2024, December 31, 2023, or March 31, 2023. The Bank did not own any foreclosed property at\nMarch 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 or March 31, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, as defined on page 5 below, increased to 77.24% for the first quarter of 2024, as\ncompared to 45.96% for the same period last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of average\nassets fell to 0.67% for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.68% for the same period last year.\nAs the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank\nutilizes these paired figures together to assess its operational efficiency over time. During periods of\nsignificant net interest income volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the\nunderlying operational efficiency of the Bank. The Bank remains focused on reducing waste through\nan ongoing process of continuous improvement and standard work that supports operational leverage.\nChairman Robert H. Gaughen Jr. stated, “Returns on equity and assets in the first quarter of 2024\nPage 3 of 9\nwere significantly lower than our long-term performance, reflecting the challenge from the increase\nin short-term interest rates over the last twenty-four months and a historically long and deep inversion\nof the yield curve. These conditions have posed a significant - albeit temporary - challenge to our\nbusiness model. Our core business has been particularly challenged during this period and our\ninvestment operations have been critical to sustaining growth in book value per share in this\nenvironment.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that this challenge will fade over this year. To the extent we can\ncapitalize on the inverted yield curve and reduce liability sensitivity slightly via our wholesale\nfunding activities, we will do so. This normalization of the yield curve will eventually allow us to\nachieve more satisfactory returns as we obtain higher rates on new and adjusting loans and\nincremental funding pressure abates.\nWhile the current market environment has been extraordinarily challenging, the Bank’s business\nmodel has been built over time to compound shareholder capital over an economic cycle. During all\nsuch periods, we remain focused on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting and disciplined\ncost control - the building blocks for compounding shareholder capital through all stages of the\neconomic cycle. These remain constant, regardless of the macroeconomic environment in which we\noperate. I believe that over the past twenty-four months we have retained this focus.”\nThe Bank’s quarterly financial results are summarized in this earnings release, but shareholders are\nencouraged to read the Bank’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is generally available several\nweeks after the earnings release. The Bank expects to file Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March\n31, 2024 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on or about May 8, 2024.\nIncorporated in 1834, Hingham Institution for Savings is one of America’s oldest banks. The Bank\nmaintains offices in Boston, Nantucket, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\nThe Bank’s shares of common stock are listed and traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the\nsymbol HIFS.\nAnnual Meeting\nThe Bank will hold its Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Meeting”) at 2:00PM EST on\nThursday, April 25, 2024 at the Old Derby Academy, located at 34 Main Street, Hingham,\nMassachusetts. Stockholders may also observe the Meeting by streaming video. Immediately\nfollowing the business meeting, the Bank will hold an informal meeting to discuss the results of the\nprior year and the operations of the Bank, as well as a question and answers session.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2024\nNOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated interim financial statements of Hingham Institution for Savings (the “Bank”) have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial statements and\nwith the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nFinancial information as of March 31, 2024, and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, is unaudited and, in the\nopinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information. Such adjustments were of a\nnormal recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. The unaudited\ninterim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Bank\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on Form 10-K.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2016-13 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ”\n(“ASC 326”) This new guidance, also referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) method, replaced the incurred loss\nmethod that was utilized in estimating the Bank’s allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) as of December 31, 2022. Under CECL, the\nBank is required to estimate credit losses expected to occur over the life of the financial instrument and to recognize those estimated\nlosses at the time of loan origination.\nThe Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method; therefore, results for reporting periods beginning on or\nafter January 1, 2023 are presented in accordance with this new guidance while prior period results are reported in accordance with the\npreviously applicable U.S. GAAP. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023 and recorded a $545,000 increase in the\nBank’s ALL for outstanding loans and no change in the reserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments, resulting in a total increase\nin the Bank’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) of $545,000. The transition adjustment, net of related tax effects, was recorded as a\ncumulative effect from the change in accounting principle and reduced the Bank’s retained earnings by $392,000.\nThe following table shows the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13.\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAs Reported Under Pre-adoption of Impact of\nASU 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 Adoption\n(In Thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses $ 25,534 $ 24,989 $ 545\nReserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments — — —\nDeferred tax asset 4,061 3,908 153\nRetained earnings 370,366 370,758 (392)\nThe amounts presented for the ALL in the table above reflect changes associated to the Bank’s loan portfolio as of adoption date.\nThe Bank also held $3.5 million in held-to-maturity debt securities as of the adoption date which, based upon management’s\nevaluation, did not require an ACL. The Bank did not hold any securities available-for-sale as of the adoption date.\nManagement also evaluated the Bank’s unfunded commitments, which at the adoption date, included primarily construction loans\nand commercial real estate lines of credit, and determined, based upon an evaluation of probability of funding and risk of loss, that the\nrequired reserve was not material.\nEarnings per common share\nBasic earnings per share represent income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive\npotential shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential shares\nthat may be issued by the Bank relate solely to outstanding stock options and are determined using the treasury stock method. The\namount of excess tax benefit that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the options is not considered in\nthe proceeds when applying the treasury stock method.\n8\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEarnings per common share have been computed based on the following:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nAverage number of shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share 2,147 2,169\nEffect of dilutive options 53 23\nAverage number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share 2,200 2,192\nThere were 1,000 antidilutive options for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to 16,000 antidilutive options for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2024.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe Bank groups its assets measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the\nreliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 1 assets generally include debt and\nequity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for\nmarket transactions involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; quoted prices\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the\nfair value of the assets. Level 3 assets include those whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets for which the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\nLoans\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio includes residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, home equity, commercial and\nconsumer segments. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in the eastern Massachusetts area. The Bank\nalso lends to commercial real estate borrowers in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and in the San Francisco\nBay Area (“SFBA”). The ability of the Bank's debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon real estate, construction, and general\neconomic conditions in these markets.\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at the\namount of their outstanding principal, including deferred loan origination fees and costs, reduced by unearned discounts, and the ACL.\nInterest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred\nand recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method.\nAccrued interest is presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial\nloans is discontinued at the time a loan is 90 days past due (the loan is in default) unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Personal loans are typically charged off no later than becoming 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual\nterms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is\nconsidered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income.\nThe interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status.\nLoans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future\npayments are reasonably assured.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Bank’s ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged against income. All, or portions of, loans deemed to\nbe uncollectible are charged against the ACL when the Bank believes that collectability of all, or some portion of, outstanding\nprincipal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, of loans previously charged off are credited to the ACL when collected.\n9\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLosses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life\nof the loan balance as of the period end date. The ACL is evaluated quarterly by management and is maintained at a level the Bank\nbelieves will be adequate to absorb expected credit losses in future periods associated with its loan portfolio and unfunded loan\ncommitments as of the period end date. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to\nsignificant revision as more information becomes available. The Bank’s CECL methodology consists of quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents, as described below. This methodology applies to the Bank’s real estate loan portfolio, which at March 31, 2024,\ncomprised virtually 100% of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Consumer and commercial loans that are not secured by real estate are\nevaluated qualitatively.\nFor the quantitative component, the Bank uses an undiscounted cash flow probability-of-default (“PD”) / loss-given-default\n(“LGD”) method, forecasted based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers and using a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast (national unemployment rate). Given the minimal level of loan losses experienced by the Bank over recent\ndecades, the Bank uses statistical data derived from a large group of community banks’ loss experience (“Index”), which incorporates\na combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available. This process includes estimates\nwhich involve projecting loan prepayments, PD and LGD throughout the life of the loan. The PD component is driven by the Call\nReport code and risk rating of the loan (Pass, Watch, Special Mention or Substandard), while the LGD component is driven by the\nCall Report code. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is determined based upon the reasonableness and level of national\nunemployment rate forecast estimates. For periods beyond a reasonable and supportable forecast time frame, the Bank reverts to\nhistorical information over a period for which comparable data is available. In determining the ACL, the Bank utilizes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period which, as of March 31, 2024, was two years followed by a one year mean reversion period. These\nassumptions are reviewed periodically to determine whether they remain appropriate.\nFor the qualitative component, management performs an assessment beyond model estimates, and applies qualitative adjustments\nas deemed necessary. The qualitative components of the ACL consider (i) the Bank’s idiosyncratic lending program attributes to\nwhich management ascribe the Bank’s lower historical losses versus the Index and the industry during periods of stress, such as\nsponsor/borrower quality, collateral valuation approach and loan-to-value, loan structure (contractual provisions, recourse to borrower)\nand collection process, among others; (ii) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios; (iii) certain portfolio characteristics, such as\nportfolio growth, concentrations of credit and delinquencies; (iv) national and local economic and industry conditions which may\naffect borrowers’ ability to pay and/or real estate values and (v) model limitations; among others.\nThe Bank segments its loan receivable population into homogeneous pools of loans which share similar risk characteristics.\nWhen a loan no longer meets the criteria of its initial pooling as a result of credit deterioration or other changes, the Bank may\nevaluate the credit for estimated losses on an individual basis. For loans with real estate collateral, when management determines that\nforeclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling\ncosts as appropriate. While an individual assessment and related ACL may be calculated for non-performing loans, no portion of the\nBank’s ACL is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire ACL is available to absorb losses from any and all\nloans, including unfunded loan commitments.\nResidential real estate – The Bank generally does not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80% (without private\nmortgage insurance). All loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate that is owner-occupied at the time of\norigination and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including\nunemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans\nin Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nCommercial real estate – Loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties throughout Massachusetts, the\nWMA and the SFBA. Underwriting and portfolio management policies are the same across all markets. Loan amounts do not exceed\n75% of the appraised value of the collateral. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties could be adversely impacted by a\ndownturn in the economy leading to increased vacancy rates which, in turn, would have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.\nManagement obtains rent rolls annually and regularly monitors the cash flows of these loans.\nConstruction – Loans in this segment include both owner-occupied and speculative real estate development loans for which payment\nis derived from sale of the property. Credit risk could be affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, the overall health\nof the economy and market conditions. The Bank only originates these loans in Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nHome equity – Loans in this segment include equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans, and are generally collateralized by\nsecond liens on residential real estate. Repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The Bank generally\ndoes not originate loans with combined loan-to-value ratios greater than 70% when taking into account both the balance of the home\nequity loans and the first mortgage loan. Similar to residential real estate, the overall health of the economy, including unemployment\nrates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans in\nMassachusetts. The Bank will not originate these loans unless it holds the senior lien position on the collateral property.\n10\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCommercial – Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is\nexpected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect\non the credit quality in this segment. These loans are not a focus of the Bank’s origination program and are only originated in\nMassachusetts.\nConsumer – Loans in this segment are generally unsecured lines of credit and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the\nindividual borrower. The Bank is no longer offering these loans.\nThe Bank has elected not to measure an ACL on accrued interest and to write off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a\ntimely manner.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are measured over the contractual period of the Bank’s exposure to credit\nrisk. The estimate of credit loss incorporates assumptions for both the likelihood and amount of funding over the estimated life of the\ncommitments, for the risk of loss, and current conditions and expectations. Management periodically reviews and updates the\nassumptions.\nLeases\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases , the Bank records operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)\nassets and operating lease liabilities relating to operating leases for some of its banking offices. These lease agreements have lease\nand non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The ROU asset is included in other assets and the operating\nlease liability is included in other liabilities on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At March 31, 2024, the ROU asset was\n$324,000 and the corresponding operating lease liability was $349,000. Operating lease costs for both the quarters ended March 31,\n2023 and 2024 were $61,000.\nThe maturities of lease liabilities are as follows at March 31, 2024:\nYears Amount\n(In Thousands)\n2024 (remaining nine months) $ 176\n2025 146\n2026 37\nTotal lease payments 359\nImputed interest (10)\nTotal lease liability $ 349\nNOTE 2: COMMITMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, outstanding loan commitments were as follows:\nDecember 31, March 31,\n2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nUnused lines of credit $ 154,917 $ 158,242\nCommitments to originate loans 56,462 57,450\nUnadvanced funds on construction loans 145,910 122,957\nStandby letters-of-credit 105 105\nTotal $ 357,394 $ 338,754\n11\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNOTE 3: DIVIDEND DECLARATION\nOn March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share to all stockholders of record as of May 6,\n2024, payable May 15, 2024.\nNOTE 4: FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nDetermination of Fair Value\nThe Bank uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances,\nthere are no quoted market prices for the Bank’s assets and liabilities. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalues are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the\nassumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be\nrealized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. There are no liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nEquity securities $ 71,517 $ 8,285 $ — $ 79,802\nMarch 31, 2024\nEquity securities $ 78,339 $ 8,917 $ — $ 87,256\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nThe Bank may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of\nindividual assets.\nThere are no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.\n12\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSummary of Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe estimated fair values, determined using the exit price notion, and related carrying amounts, of the Bank’s financial\ninstruments are as follows.

The balance at December 31, 2023 was made up of a $3.5 million investment in the subordinated debt issued by a bank\nholding company in 2021 in which the Bank also maintains a common equity investment. The notes have a 3.75% five year fixed to\nfloating rate, mature in 2031, and are callable quarterly at the option of the issuer after the fifth year anniversary.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Bank made a $2.0 million investment in the subordinated debt of another bank holding\ncompany. The notes have a 8.75% fixed rate and three year maturity, with final maturity in 2027.\nThe Bank intends to hold the bonds until maturity, and therefore they are recorded at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. There was no other-than-temporary impairment recorded during the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\nEquity securities\nAt December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, equity securities include a $8.9 million and $8.8 million investment in the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Qualified Investment Fund, respectively, and a $70.9 million and $78.5 million investment in\nmarketable common equity securities, respectively.\nThe Bank did not sell any equity securities in the three months ended March 31, 2023 or March 31, 2024. Unrealized losses\nrecognized during the first quarter of 2023 on securities still held at March 31, 2023 were $3.5 million.

The borrower may be affected by unfavorable economic, market or other external conditions that\nmay affect their ability to repay the debt. These may also include credits where there is deterioration of the collateral or have\ndeficiencies which may affect our ability to collect on the collateral. This rating is consistent with the “Other Assets Especially\nMentioned” category used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).\nLoans rated 5 : Loans in this category are considered “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately\nprotected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that\nthe Bank will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.\nLoans rated 6 : Loans in this category are considered “doubtful.” Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in\nthose classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of\ncurrently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans rated 7 : Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is\nnot warranted.\n16\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCommercial real estate loans are assigned an initial risk rating by the Bank at the origination of the loan. Subsequently, the Bank\nhas a quality control program performed by an independent third party. Quarterly, all new commercial real estate, construction and\nresidential real estate loan relationships with outstanding balances or commitments of $500,000 or more are reviewed and assigned a\nrisk rating. On a rolling quarterly basis, an in-depth review is performed on all commercial real estate relationships (and related\nresidential loans) with exposure in excess of $850,000 and all loans on the Bank’s Watch List. Commercial real estate relationships\n(and related residential loans) with exposure between $500,000 and $850,000 are reviewed at least annually. Watch List loans are\nthose loans that are more than two payments past due at the end of the quarter, loans for which the borrowing entity or sponsor has\nfiled bankruptcy, loans rated four or higher in a previous review, impaired loans, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, and loans past contractual maturity. Results of the independent loan review are reported to the Bank’s Audit\nCommittee on a quarterly basis and become the mechanism for monitoring the overall credit quality of the portfolio.\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of December 31, 2023:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,083 $ 239,232 $ — $ — $ 492,508\n4 — — — — 161 1,363 — — 1,524\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,244 $ 240,595 $ — $ — $ 494,032\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n17\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (concluded)\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of March 31, 2024:\nAs of March 31, 2024\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 6,855 $ 30,204 $ 40,017 $ 75,029 $ 64,364 $ 271,304 $ — $ — $ 487,773\n4 — — — — — 3,138 — — 3,138\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 6,855 $ 30,204 $ 40,017 $ 75,029 $ 64,364 $ 274,442 $ — $ — $ 490,911\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 32,571 $ 268,026 $ 873,131 $ 843,084 $ 466,229 $ 626,601 $ 55,663 $ — $ 3,165,305\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 32,571 $ 268,026 $ 873,131 $ 843,084 $ 466,229 $ 626,601 $ 55,663 $ — $ 3,165,305\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 4,607 $ 94,523 $ 165,025 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ 287,026\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n— — — — — — — — —\n5\nTotal $ 4,607 $ 94,523 $ 165,025 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ 287,026\nResidential real estate loans are rated 1-3B at origination with subsequent adjustments based on delinquency or upon review if\nincluded in the scope of the Bank’s loan review process described above.

Matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our\npublic disclosures, whether written or oral, relating to future events or our future performance, including any discussion, expressed or\nimplied, of our anticipated growth, operating results, future earnings per share, plans and objectives, contain forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThese statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “continue,” “intend,” “expect,”\n“future,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact. These statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including changes in political and\neconomic climate, interest rate fluctuations and competitive product and pricing pressures within the Bank’s market, bond market\nfluctuations, personal and corporate customers’ bankruptcies and inflation. Our actual results and timing of certain events could differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those\nset forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings with the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). It is routine for internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter\nin the year progresses and, therefore, it should be clearly understood that all forward-looking statements and the internal projections\nand beliefs upon which we base our expectations included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may change. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the\nfuture, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Bank’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments\ninvolving significant estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of its accounting policies about the effects of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and\nchanges in this information over time could materially impact amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements as a result of\nthe use of different estimates and assumptions. Certain accounting policies, by their nature, have a greater reliance on the use of\nestimates and assumptions and could produce results materially different from those originally reported.\nBased on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates and assumptions underlying reported amounts,\nthe most significant accounting estimate followed by the Bank has been identified by management as the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”). This policy requires the most subjective and complex judgments and, as such, could be most\nsubject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying\nthis accounting estimate is essential in order to understand the Bank’s reported financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which impacted the Bank’s methodology for estimating the ACL. This accounting\npolicy and its application in recent periods is described in more detail in the “Provision for Credit Losses” section of this discussion\nand analysis and in Note 1 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements”\nelsewhere in this report.\nIn developing the ACL estimate, management considers historical charge-offs, loan-to-value ratios, underlying collateral values,\npayment history, the size of the loan portfolio and the risks associated with certain loan types as well as other factors such as local\neconomic trends, market conditions and credit concentrations. The Bank’s ACL estimate is determined using a probability-of-default\n/ loss-given default undiscounted cash flow model (“Model”), adjusted by management’s qualitative factors. Given the Bank’s long\nterm history of immaterial net charge-offs, the Model relies on statistical information derived from the loss experience of an index\ncomposed of other community banks, and is largely dependent on management’s qualitative factors, which are determined based on\nthe elements described above. Therefore, the estimate is sensitive to the Model’s parameters and assumptions, and management’s\nsubjectivity in the assessment of the qualitative factors.\nIf management’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the ACL is inadequate to absorb expected losses, or if\nbank regulatory authorities require the Bank to increase the ACL as a part of their examination process, the Bank’s earnings and\ncapital could be significantly and adversely affected.\nNote on Core Return on Average Equity and Core Return on Average Assets\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities , equity securities (except those\naccounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income, regardless of\nwhether such gains and losses are realized, and included in the other income (loss) category. This change affects the Bank’s portfolio\n19\nof marketable equity securities, which includes common equity securities and a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify\nfor the Community Reinvestment Act securities test. This portfolio primarily includes common equity investments, which the Bank\nviews as long-term partnership interests in operating companies. Consequently the Bank does not view the quarterly fluctuation in\nmarket value as indicative of the change in the intrinsic value of these portfolio holdings. The performance of these holdings should\nbe evaluated on the basis of their contribution to growth in book value per share over time, not via quarterly adjustments to net\nincome.\nConsistent with this view, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nincorporates core net income, core return on average equity, and core return on average assets, which are non-U.S. GAAP\nmeasurements that exclude the after-tax effect of gain (loss) on equity securities, net, both realized and unrealized. These disclosures\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable to non-U.S. GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between net income and core net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2024:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024\nNon-U.S. GAAP reconciliation:\nNet Income $ 8,510 $ 6,868\nGain loss on equity securities, net (3,548) (5,971)\nIncome tax expense (1) 782 1,316\nCore Net Income 5,744 2,213\n(1) The equity securities are held in a tax-advantaged subsidiary corporation.

The Bank’s\nannualized return on average equity for the first quarter of 2024 was 6.63%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.63%,\ncompared to 8.67% and 0.82% for the same period in 2023. Core net income for the first quarter of 2024, which represents net\nincome excluding the after-tax gains and losses on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, was $2,213,000 or $1.02 per share\nbasic and $1.01 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 2.14% and an annualized core return on\naverage assets of 0.20%. This compares to core net income of $5,744,000 or $2.67 per share basic and $2.61 per share diluted,\nrepresenting an annualized core return on average equity of 5.85% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.56% for the\nsame period in 2023.\nThe net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 61 basis points to 0.85%, as compared to 1.46% for the same period\nin 2023. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the prior year. This\nwas driven primarily by the repricing of the Bank’s wholesale borrowings, wholesale deposits and higher rates on the Bank’s retail and\n20\ncommercial deposits. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was partially offset by a higher yield on interest-earning\nassets, driven primarily by an increase in the interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (“FRBB”), a higher\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB”) stock dividend and an increase in the yield on loans.\nTotal assets increased by $45.4 million from December 31, 2023 and $323.4 million from March 31, 2023, representing 4%\nannualized growth year-to-date and 8% growth from March 31, 2023. Net loans increased by $24.0 million from December 31, 2023\nand $266.0 million from March 31, 2023, representing 2% annualized growth year-to-date and 7% growth from March 31, 2023.\nTotal deposits, including wholesale deposits, increased to $2.393 billion at March 31, 2024, representing 7% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and a 5% decline from March 31, 2023. Total retail and business deposits increased to $1.893 billion at March 31, 2024,\nrepresenting 7% annualized growth year-to-date and a 5% decline from March 31, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included in\nretail and business deposits, increased to $347.4 million at March 31, 2024, representing a 10% annualized growth year-to-date and a\n8% decline from March 31, 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank continued to focus on developing and deepening deposit\nrelationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit customers, retaining maturing time deposit balances, and managing its\nwholesale funding mix between wholesale time deposits and FHLB advances in order to mitigate the negative impact of increasing\nshort term rates in the cost of funds.\nStockholders’ equity increased to $414.4 million as of March 31, 2024, representing 7% annualized growth year-to-date and a 6%\nincrease from March 31, 2023. Book value per share increased to $190.07 per share at March 31, 2024, from $188.50 per share at\nDecember 31, 2023 and $182.89 per share at March 31, 2023. Since March 31, 2023, the Bank declared dividends of $2.52 per share.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the first quarter of 2024. At March 31, 2024, non-performing assets totaled\n0.04% of total assets, compared with 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and 0.01% at March 31, 2023. Non-performing loans as a\npercentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.04% at March 31, 2024, as compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 0.01% at\nMarch 31, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents total operating expenses, divided by the sum of net interest income and total other income ,\nexcluding gain on equity securities, net, increased to 77.24% for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to 45.96% in the same period\nlast year. Operating expenses (annualized) as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.67% for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to\n0.68% for the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the\nBank utilizes these paired figures together to assess its operational efficiency over time. During periods of significant net interest\nincome volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational efficiency of the Bank. The Bank\nremains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of continuous improvement and standard work that supports\noperational leverage. These figures reflect the Bank’s continued focus on credit quality and disciplined expense management.\nThe Bank continues to exceed all of the minimum regulatory capital requirements.\n21\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\nGeneral\nThe Bank reported net income of $6.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $8.5 million for the quarter\nended March 31, 2023. Net income was $3.17 per share basic and $3.13 per share diluted for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as\ncompared to $3.96 per share basic and $3.87 per share diluted for the same period in 2023. Earnings for the quarter ended March 31,\n2024 were negatively impacted by a decrease of $5.8 million in net interest income and a $244,000 increase in operating expenses,\npartially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in other income, a $48,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses and a decrease of\n$2.0 million in the income tax provision. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was\n6.63%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.63%, compared to 8.67% and 0.82%, respectively, for the same period in\n2023.\nCore net income for the first quarter of 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gains on equity securities, both\nrealized and unrealized, was $2.2 million or $1.02 per share basic and $1.01 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return\non average equity of 2.14% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.20%. This compares to core net income of $5.7\nmillion or $2.67 per share basic and $2.61 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 5.85% and an\nannualized core return on average assets of 0.56% for the same period in 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $9.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. The $5.8 million\ndecrease was due to a 79 basis point decrease in the weighted average spread, partially offset by a $203.9 million, or 5%, increase in\naverage interest-earning assets in the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, the weighted average rate spread and net interest margin were 0.13% and 0.85%, respectively, compared to\n0.92% and 1.46%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $220.0\nmillion, or 7% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 122 basis points during the same period.\nIn early 2022, after a sustained period of lower short term market rates, the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities began to\nmove up sharply following the increase in short term market interest rates. This trend accelerated in the second half of 2022 and in\n2023. The higher average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a higher average yield on interest-earning assets,\ndriven primarily by an increase in the yield on loans and an increase in the interest on reserves held at the FRBB. This resulted in a\nsignificantly lower net interest margin in the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $6.7 million to $47.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $40.7 million\nfor the first quarter of 2023, driven by the increase in average interest-earning assets discussed above. The yield on total\ninterest-earning assets was 4.43% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 4.00% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased by $6.7 million when comparing the two periods, primarily resulting from a 7% increase in\naverage loan balances, combined with a 40 basis point increase in yield.\nSecurities and short-term investments accounted for 8% of the total average interest-earning assets for the quarter ended March\n31, 2024 compared to 10% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as the Bank continued to manage its balance sheet to reduce the\ncarrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. This was partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the Bank’s equity securities\nportfolio when compared to the prior year. This includes the Bank’s cash holdings at the FRBB. Combined income for these\ncategories increased by $12,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to higher average yields, partially offset by a $70.0\nmillion decrease in combined average balances. The decrease in the Bank's cash held at the FRBB as a percentage of interest-earning\nassets was partially offset by a higher interest rate paid on excess reserves. Also, the dividend on the Bank’s stock investment at the\nFHLB increased during the period, driven by a larger average balance of FHLB stock and a higher dividend yield.\nThe average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.30% for the first quarter of 2024 from 3.08% for the comparable\nquarter of 2023. Total interest expense increased by $12.5 million when comparing the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 due\nto higher interest rates on deposits and borrowings, combined with higher aggregate average balances.\nInterest expense on deposits for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $7.4 million over the same period in 2023, due to a 158\nbasis point increase in the weighted average rate, partially offset by a decrease of $151.3 million in average interest-bearing deposits.\nAfter a sustained period of historically low short term rates, beginning in early 2022 the Bank observed rising market pricing for term\ndeposits, money market accounts, and wholesale funds. This trend, which was sustained during 2022 and 2023, began to abate in the\nfirst quarter of 2024. The Bank continued to manage core product rates, implemented special offerings, and continued to use\nwholesale time deposits to remain competitive while balancing cost versus growth.\nInterest expense on borrowed funds for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $5.2 million as compared to the same quarter in\n2023, primarily due to a 31 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, combined with a $370.9 million increase in average\nbalances. The increase in the FHLB borrowings rate was primarily driven by the higher short-term market rates, partially offset by the\nuse of lower rate FHLB HLB-Option advances taken in 2023. The FHLB of Boston provides an explanation of HLB-Option\nAdvances on its website under the “Products' ' section that explains the features of this product.\n22\nThe following tables detail components of net interest income and yields/rates on daily average earning assets/liabilities.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023 2024\nAVERAGE YIELD/ AVERAGE YIELD/\nBALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9) BALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9)\n(In Thousands)\nLoans (1) (2) $ 3,682,517 $ 36,416 3.96 % $ 3,956,135 $ 43,120 4.36 %\nSecurities (3) (4) 99,693 936 3.76 116,203 1,495 5.15\nFederal Reserve and other short-term investments 294,513 3,374 4.58 208,245 2,827 5.43\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,076,723 40,726 4.00 4,280,583 47,442 4.43\nOther assets 53,809 64,034\nTotal assets $ 4,130,532 $ 4,344,617\nInterest-bearing deposits (5) $ 2,250,188 13,800 2.45 $ 2,098,851 21,146 4.03\nBorrowed funds 1,100,156 12,015 4.37 1,471,027 17,212 4.68\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,350,344 25,815 3.08 3,569,878 38,358 4.30\nDemand deposits 378,089 346,136\nOther liabilities 9,452 14,261\nTotal liabilities 3,737,885 3,930,275\nStockholders’ equity 392,647 414,342\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,130,532 $ 4,344,617\nNet interest income $ 14,911 $ 9,084\nWeighted average spread 0.92 % 0.13 %\nNet interest margin (6) 1.46 % 0.85 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average\ninterest-bearing liabilities (7) 121.68 % 119.91 %\n(1) Before allowance for credit losses.\n(2) Includes average non-accrual loans.\n(3) Excludes the impact of the average net unrealized gain or loss on securities.\n(4) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n(5) Includes mortgagors' escrow accounts.\n(6) Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(7) Total interest-earning assets divided by total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8) Average balances are calculated on a daily basis.\n(9) Annualized.\nThe following table presents information regarding changes in interest and dividend income and interest expense of the Bank for\nthe periods indicated.

The Bank determined that a $545,000 adjustment to increase the allowance\nfor credit losses and no reserve for unfunded commitments was required upon adoption. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nAt March 31, 2024, management's review of the allowance for credit losses concluded that a balance of $26.8 million was\nadequate to provide for losses based upon evaluation of risk in the loan portfolio. During the first quarter of 2024, management\nprovided $108,000 to achieve such an allowance for credit loss balance at March 31, 2024. Comparably, at March 31, 2023,\nmanagement’s evaluation of the balance of the allowance for loan losses indicated the need for a quarterly provision of $156,000.\nCredit quality remained strong with no delinquent or non performing commercial real estate loans as of March 31, 2024. The Bank\ndid not record any charge-offs in the first quarters of 2024 or 2023.\nSee Notes 1 and 6 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and “Loans and Foreclosed Real Estate”\nincluded in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information pertaining to the allowance for credit losses.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of gain on equity securities, net, customer service fees on deposits, increases in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance policies and miscellaneous income. Total other income was $6.2 million for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024, compared to other income of $3.8 million for the same period in 2023. In the first three months of 2024, the Bank\nrecorded gains totaling $6.0 million on equity securities, comprised solely of unrealized gains on equity securities held at the end of\nthe period. In the first three months of 2023, the Bank recorded gains totaling $3.5 million on equity securities, comprised solely of\nunrealized gains on equity securities held at the end of the period\nCustomer service fees on deposits decreased marginally in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In\nrecent years, there has been a continuous decline in deposit account transaction fees, as the Bank has eliminated many fees on deposit\nproducts to simplify offerings and enhance the value proposition of our consumer and business checking accounts to customers.\nGenerally, the Bank’s strategy does not rely on generating substantial non-interest fee-based revenue from our deposit accounts.\nAn increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance also contributed to other income during the first quarter of\n2024 and 2023. The Bank held $13.7 million in life insurance policies at March 31, 2024 as compared to $13.4 million at March 31,\n2023. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. Income from these assets is fully\nexcludable from federal income taxes and contributed $81,000 to other income in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $83,000 for\nthe same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, deposit insurance,\nmarketing, foreclosure and related, and other general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses were $7.2 million, or an\nannualized 0.67% of average total assets, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $7.0 million, or an annualized 0.68%\nof average total assets, for the same period of 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses decreased by $9,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to reductions in executive pay implemented during 2023, partially offset by annual merit-based salary\nincreases and enhancements to our operational teams. The number of employees remained stable, reflecting additional staff in our\nCommercial Real Estate group and Specialized Deposit Group (“SDG”) and operational teams, partially offset by a smaller branch\nstaff.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses increased by $40,000, or 10%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher depreciation expenses, as the Bank made improvements to\nthe corporate offices, which were completed in the second half of 2023. Lower rental income recorded in the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 also contributed to the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The Bank owns rental apartments located\nabove its Nantucket branch which are rented during the summer season.\nData processing expenses for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $102,000, or 16%, when compared to the same period in 2023,\ndriven primarily by higher data processing charges associated with improvements made to the Bank's systems and volume increases in\n2024. Technology spending at the Bank remains focused on three primary objectives: delivering new or improved customer\nexperience, reducing costs through simplification and automation of internal processes, and securing customer and Bank confidential\ninformation.\nDeposit insurance expense for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $160,000, or 25%, when compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase was the result of a higher assessed rate, combined with a larger assessment base, driven by the Bank’s balance\nsheet growth. Deposit insurance expense consists of premiums paid to the FDIC and the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund\n(“DIF”). The FDIC assessment rate is determined based on several factors, including capitalization, asset growth, earnings, use of\nbrokered deposits and level of non-performing assets, among others, and is calculated on an assessment base that takes into\nconsideration the Bank’s average total assets and average tangible equity, among other factors. The DIF assessment rate is based on\nan institution’s risk category, which is defined based on similar factors. Effective the first quarterly assessment period of 2023, the\nFDIC implemented a system-wide increase that applied to all banks, which increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate\n24\nby 2 basis points. The Bank carefully manages its balance sheet to control the deposit insurance expense associated with excess\nliquidity while optimizing its funding mix.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $123,000, or 58%, for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as the\nBank continues to carefully manage these expenses focusing on business development for the Bank’s Commercial Real Estate Group\nand SDG. The Bank continued to shift its marketing spending during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 towards supporting its\ncommercial deposit acquisition activities in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and the San Francisco Bay Area\n(“SFBA”).\nForeclosure and related expenses include expenses associated with the collection and foreclosure process, such as legal, tax,\nappraisal, insurance and other related foreclosure expenses. These expenses may be recovered when the loan returns to performing\nstatus or when the Bank exercises its remedies, as they are generally secured by the Bank’s mortgages. Such recoveries, if any, are\nreflected in future periods as contra-expense. The Bank recorded $32,000 in foreclosure and related expenses in the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 as compared to a $74,000 credit in the same period in 2023. The credit in the prior year was attributed to the recovery\nof expenses in connection with the resolution of certain non-performing loans recorded in the first quarter of 2023, including an\n$85,000 gain on disposal recorded on the sale of a foreclosed property. At March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023,\nthe Bank did not own any foreclosed property.\nOther general and administrative expenses, which include director fees, supplies, deposit related losses and audit-related\nexpenses, among others, decreased by $32,000, or 4%, when comparing the two periods, reflecting lower miscellaneous expenses,\nincluding supplies, travel and legal expenses, partially offset by higher loan and audit-related expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Bank recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established\nfor the temporary difference between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. The Bank's deferred tax asset\nis reviewed quarterly by management as to the realizability of such asset.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded $1.1 million, or 14.1% of pre-tax income, in tax expense as compared to $3.1\nmillion, or 26.7%, for the same quarter in 2023. The lower effective tax rate was the result of higher unrealized gains on equity\nsecurities recognized during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, as these securities are held at a\ntax-advantaged subsidiary, combined with $465,000 of stock options excess tax benefit and the revision of income tax estimates\nrecorded in the first quarter of 2024. There was no stock option excess tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2023.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nCOMPARISON AT MARCH 31, 2024 TO DECEMBER 31, 2023\nAssets totaled $4.529 billion at March 31, 2024, as compared to $4.484 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $45.4\nmillion, or 4% annualized. During the first quarter of 2024, the Bank continued to manage the balance of excess reserves held at the\nFRBB, in order to minimize the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity.\nSecurities, Short-term Investments and FHLB Stock\nSecurities were $92.8 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $9.5 million when compared to $83.3 million at December 31,\n2023, reflecting an increase in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio and a $2.0 million increase in debt securities held to\nmaturity. The fair value of equity securities fluctuates with the performance of equity markets.\nAt both March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank held a $3.5 million investment in the subordinated debt issued by a bank holding\ncompany in which the Bank also maintains an equity investment. The notes have a 3.75% five year fixed to floating rate, mature in\n2031, and are callable quarterly at the option of the issuer beginning in May 2026. At March 31, 2024, the Bank also held a $2.0\nmillion investment in the subordinated debt of another bank holding company. The notes have a 8.75% fixed rate and three year\nmaturity in 2027. These investments are included in securities held to maturity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt March 31, 2024, equity securities accounted for approximately 94% of the investment portfolio. At March 31, 2024, the Bank\nheld a $8.8 million investment in the CRA Fund, a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify under the CRA securities\ntest. Additionally, the portfolio included $78.5 million in marketable common equity securities. The Bank’s marketable common\nequity securities are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior returns on capital over a longer time\nhorizon. The Bank’s process is focused on identifying businesses with strong returns on capital, owner-oriented management teams,\ngood reinvestment opportunities or capital discipline, and reasonable valuations. The portfolio is concentrated in a relatively small\nnumber of investments in the financial services and technology areas. The Bank receives two sources of advantageous tax treatment\nthrough these investments. First, dividend distributions from these companies to the Bank are partially excluded from the Bank’s\ntaxable income due to the Dividends Received Deduction. Second, to the extent that these companies are capable of internal\nreinvestment at high rates of return or deploy capital via tax-advantaged repurchases, the deferred tax liability associated with any\nlong-term unrealized gains on our investments constitutes an interest-free source of financing.\nAs a member of the FHLB of Boston, the Bank is required to hold a Membership Stock Investment plus an Activity-based Stock\nInvestment in the FHLB, which is based primarily on the amount of FHLB borrowings. The Bank recorded dividends on FHLB stock\n25\ntotaling $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $747,000 for the same period in 2023. The increase\nreflected the dividend rate increase implemented by the FHLB, as well as a higher balance of FHLB stock. At March 31, 2024, the\nBank held $69.5 million in FHLB stock compared to $69.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nLoans and Foreclosed Real Estate\nDuring the first three months of 2024, net loans outstanding increased by $24.0 million to $3.938 billion, from $3.914 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, attributable primarily to originated loans of $57.2 million, partially offset by payoffs and amortization.\nComparably, loan originations for the same period in 2023 were $62.9 million. At both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net\nloans outstanding represented 87% of assets. Mortgage loans continue to account for more than 99% of the loan portfolio.\nA breakdown of the originated loan by geography follows:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMassachusetts $ 36,825 59 % $ 40,473 71 %\nWashington Metropolitan Area 24,714 39 16,743 29\nSan Francisco Bay Area 1,400 2 — —\nTotal $ 62,939 100 % $ 57,216 100 %\nAt March 31, 2024, the Bank had $1.199 billion and $118.1 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loans originated in the\nWMA and the SFBA outstanding (including construction loans). At December 31, 2023, the Bank had $1.199 billion and $118.5\nmillion, respectively, of loans originated in the WMA and the SFBA outstanding.\nWMA: The Bank began lending to commercial real estate borrowers in the WMA in November 2016, after several years of\nresearch and preparation. The Bank had also held direct equity investments in other WMA area banks prior to entering the market\noperationally. In 2019, the Bank opened a commercial lending office at a temporary location and hired a commercial real estate\nlender. In February 2020, the Bank acquired a property in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., renovated the property,\nand opened a commercial banking office in 2022. The Bank obtained regulatory approval to exercise branch powers at this office in\n2023. The Bank has a senior commercial real estate lender based in the WMA, along with a relationship manager from the Bank’s\nSDG. When needed, the Bank also utilizes Boston-based staff in its Commercial Real Estate Group and SDG with experience in the\nWMA, on a fly-away basis from its main office.\nThe Bank originally identified the WMA as an attractive opportunity for three reasons. First, the region has favorable economic\ncharacteristics that will support long-term investments in commercial real estate. It is the capital of the world’s largest economy, it is\nan international economic gateway, it has one of the highest household median income of any of the nation’s major metropolitan areas,\nand it has a relatively high concentration of young people. Second, the commercial real estate product in the market bears significant\nsimilarity to Boston, characterized by high density, urban infill development, transit-oriented multifamily, and scarcity imposed by\nland supply and restrictions on vertical development. Third, we believe that the banking market in Washington, D.C. has experienced\na level of consolidation and disruption that has left smaller and mid-sized real estate investors underserved as compared to the Boston\nmarket. Although we are relatively new to this marketplace, we believe that our history as one of America’s oldest banks and our\nfamily management team provide stability and surety of execution that is valued by our customers. With over five years of operation\nin the market, we have gained increasing confidence in this thesis. We view this as an attractive opportunity for internal capital\nallocation and superior to geographically proximate, product-adjacent businesses like wealth management, insurance, or\ncommercial-industrial lending in our home marketplace. The Bank did not initially make commercial construction loans in this\nmarket, as these loans have a higher level of inherent risk. As the Bank developed greater familiarity with the market and the portfolio\ngrew, the Bank made the investment in the operational capacity to originate and manage such loans in the WMA and the Bank now\noriginates the full range of commercial mortgages in Washington. For similar reasons, the Bank also delayed originating residential\nowner occupant loans in the WMA, but as the Bank’s customer base has grown, the Bank has seen significant demand for this service.\nIn 2023, the Bank began offering such loans to existing commercial and private clients of the Bank in the WMA.\nSFBA: The San Francisco Bay Area is the Bank’s newest and smallest market, having begun operations in 2021 with a focus on\ncommercial real estate customers and commercial and nonprofit deposit relationships. The Bank relies to a large extent on Boston and\nWMA-based staff to cover the initial operations in this market. The Bank recently hired a deposit-focused relationship manager in\nSan Francisco to join the SDG and is actively looking to hire a dedicated commercial real estate lender in this market. The Bank does\nnot have a retail branch in this market. The Bank built the operational framework for originating commercial real estate loans in the\nSFBA and began engaging with prospective customers in 2021. The Bank closed its first loan in the SFBA in the fourth quarter of\n2021 and continued to originate loans in 2022, and to a lesser extent, in 2023. Ther Bank did not originate loans in the SFBA in the\nfirst quarter of 2024.\nThis initiative builds on several years of research and direct equity investments that provided the Bank with exposure and insight\ninto the SFBA real estate and banking markets, but the Bank’s long-term plans were accelerated to capitalize the pandemic-related\n26\ndisruption in those markets. The Bank continues to believe that the most attractive markets for its business are coastal, urban, gateway\ncities with substantial wealth, favorable demographics, substantial multifamily real estate, and consolidation among small and\nmid-sized banks. This initiative has initially focused on both investor and owner-occupied commercial real estate and multifamily\nproperties. The Bank does not yet originate commercial construction or owner-occupied residential loans in the SFBA.\nOriginations in the SFBA have been materially lower when compared to the WMA and Boston markets. This is largely the\nproduct of the changes in market conditions in 2023 and 2024 in the SFBA market, as opposed to a deliberate choice by the Bank to\nalter its approach to the marketplace. There were some SFBA market-specific conditions in 2023, including disruption in the local\nbanking market and several well-publicized portfolios of distressed multifamily properties, that appear to have had a differential\nimpact on the SFBA multifamily market. The Bank continues to engage actively with prospective customers in the SFBA for both\nlending and deposit opportunities.\nAll WMA and SFBA underwriting and approval processes are identical to those utilized in the Boston marketplace and all loans\nare reviewed and approved by the Bank’s Executive Committee and when larger than $2.0 million, by the Bank’s full Board of\nDirectors. A member of the Executive Committee performs a site visit for every collateral property. The Bank has retained local\ncounsel in both markets to advise on all of its transactional needs, with oversight on each individual transaction by the Bank’s primary\nreal estate counsel in Boston. The Bank uses the same consulting firm in Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco for\nenvironmental assessments and property condition reports to ensure quality of execution and manage risk. This firm also performs\nseismic risk assessments in San Francisco for the Bank. The Bank generally requires that all third-party assessments are conducted by\nthe Bank’s consultants and will not generally accept reports ordered separately by a borrower. Once closed, these loans are subject to\nall of the Bank’s regular quality control and portfolio management processes.\nThe Bank approaches prospective borrowers directly via advertising programs, and indirectly via intermediaries such as attorneys,\naccountants and mortgage brokers. The Bank also has existing Boston-based customers with real estate investment holdings in both\nthe Massachusetts and the WMA or SFBA markets.\nCommercial real estate loans by collateral type at December 31, 2023 and March, 31 2024 , are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 March 31, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMultifamily (5+) $ 1,077,174 34 % $ 1,092,830 35 %\nResidential (1-4) 481,014 15 485,853 15\nOffice 508,397 16 482,314 15\nMixed use 524,657 17 540,469 17\nRetail 300,429 10 302,965 10\nIndustrial 133,863 4 132,488 4\nLand 59,508 2 59,130 2\nOthers 70,242 2 69,256 2\nTotal $ 3,155,284 100 % $ 3,165,305 100 %\nMixed-use properties generally consist of urban properties which combine a substantial multifamily use with street level retail or\noffice uses.\nLoans are carried net of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is maintained at a level to absorb losses within the loan\nportfolio. At March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses had a balance of $26.8 million, as compared to $26.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.67% of gross loans as of March 31, 2024, as compared to 0.68% at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Bank’s non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and foreclosed real estate. At March 31, 2024, there were eight\nresidential loans classified as non-accrual totaling $1.7 million as compared to five non-accrual loans totaling $1.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, non-performing assets were 0.04% of total assets, as compared to 0.03% at December 31,\n2023. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no foreclosed assets. The Bank works closely with delinquent\nmortgagors to bring their loans current and commences foreclosure proceedings if the mortgagor is unable to satisfy their outstanding\nobligation. Although regulatory changes have slowed the foreclosure process in recent years, the Bank continues to pursue\ndelinquencies vigorously.\nManagement believes that its loans classified as non-accrual are significantly collateralized, pose minimal risk of loss to the Bank,\nand the allowance for credit losses allocated to these loans is sufficient to absorb such losses, if any. However, management continues\nto monitor the loan portfolio and additional reserves will be recorded if necessary.\n27\nBelow is a summary of non-performing assets:\nDecember 31, March 31,\n2023 2024\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-accrual loans:\nResidential real estate $ 877 $ 1,148\nCommercial real estate — —\nHome equity 602 601\nTotal non-accrual loans 1,479 1,749\nForeclosed real estate — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 1,479 $ 1,749\nPercent of non-accrual loans to:\nTotal loans 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nPercent of non-performing assets to:\nTotal loans and foreclosed real estate 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 0.68 % 0.67 %\nOther Assets\nThe Bank held $13.7 million in bank-owned life insurance at March 31, 2024, as compared to $13.6 million at December 31,\n2023. The $81,000 increase during the first three months of 2024 is due to increases in the cash surrender value of policies insuring\nthe life of a current Bank executive. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. The\nBank monitors the financial strength and counterparty credit ratings of the policy issuers and has determined that at March 31, 2024,\none of three issuers was rated at or above Bank guidelines. Of the other two issuers, one retained a rating from A.M. Best two notches\nbelow Bank guidelines at B++ , while the other retained a rating from Moody’s and Fitch two and one notches below Bank guidelines\nat Baa1 and A-, respectively (with a stable outlook).\nAs of March 31, 2024, the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability related to operating leases for two of the Bank’s\nbanking offices was $324,000 and $349,000, respectively. The right-of-use asset is included in other assets and the lease liability is\nincluded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Bank holds a $2.4 million investment in the common stock of Founders Bank, a de novo bank in\nWashington, D.C. This balance includes a $2.3 million initial investment in common stock and related unrealized gains.\nAs of March 31, 2024, other assets included a $741,000 investment in the WHI, a CRA investment vehicle that provides low cost\nloans to acquire and develop affordable workforce housing in Washington D.C. and a $5.0 million investment in the SFHA Fund, a\nCRA investment vehicle that provides low cost loans to acquire and develop affordable workforce housing in San Francisco.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased by $42.9 million to $2.393 billion at March 31, 2024, from $2.350 billion at December 31, 2023.\nNon-certificate accounts, which include regular, money market, NOW and demand deposits, increased by $17.1 million from\nDecember 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, while certificate balances increased by $25.8 million. The increase in non-certificate accounts\nwas driven by money market and demand deposit accounts, as the Bank enhanced the team of relationship managers to improve\ndeposit retention and drive growth. The increase in certificate account balances primarily reflects a $11.7 million increase in\nwholesale time deposits, which includes both brokered and Internet listing services time deposits, combined with $14.1 million growth\nin retail and commercial time deposits, as the Bank focused on improving retention of maturing deposits while continuing to offer\ncompetitive rates to drive growth. Non-certificate accounts represent 49.0% of total deposits at both March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.\nOther banks and credit unions in the Bank's market areas, banking services through the Internet, and mutual funds make up the\nBank’s primary competition for deposits. At times, the Bank also faces direct and indirect competition from fixed income securities\nsuch as U.S Treasury bills or non-bank financial services companies with access to the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. The Bank's ability to attract and retain deposits depends upon satisfaction of depositors' requirements with\nrespect to insurance, product, rate and service. The Bank offers traditional deposit products, competitive rates, convenient branch\nlocations, ATMs, debit cards and Internet-based banking for consumers and commercial account holders. The Bank also opens deposit\naccounts, including checking accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, directly online for personal customers.\nOccasionally, the Bank implements special offerings based on market conditions and the competitive environment. The Bank also\noffers a limited range of certificate of deposit products using national Internet listing services and brokered deposits. These\nalternatives, at times, provide the Bank with a source of funding across different maturities at lower cost and/or longer duration than\n28\nmay be available via retail or other wholesale channels. At March 31, 2024, the Bank had $500.4 million in deposits from these\nsources, as compared to $488.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank carefully manages its wholesale funding mix allocation\nbased on market conditions to reduce the Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities and minimize the negative effect of higher\nshort-term rates on the Bank’s net interest margin. In doing this, the Bank takes into consideration each funding source’s interest rate,\nbroker commission and FDIC insurance assessment implications (as applicable), speed of execution as well as the operational\ncharacteristics. This approach has allowed the Bank to maintain deposit balances to fund lending activity and operate with an elevated\nlevel of liquidity.\nDeposits are insured in full through the combination of the FDIC and the DIF. Generally, separately insured deposit accounts are\ninsured up to $250,000 by the FDIC and deposit balances in excess of this amount are insured by the DIF. DIF insurance provides an\nadvantage for the Bank as some competitors cannot offer this coverage.\nBelow is a summary of deposits:\nDeposit Balances by Type\nDecember 31, % of March 31, % of\n2023 Total 2024 Total\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-certificate accounts\nRegular $ 82,050 3.5 % $ 75,910 3.2 %\nMoney market deposits 723,786 30.8 738,045 30.9\nNOW 11,425 0.5 12,092 0.5\nDemand 339,059 14.4 347,397 14.5\nTotal non-certificate accounts 1,156,320 49.2 1,173,444 49.1\nTerm certificates of less than $250,000 836,382 35.6 847,586 35.4\nTerm certificates of $250,000 or more 357,275 15.2 371,891 15.5\nTotal certificate accounts 1,193,657 50.8 1,219,477 50.9\nTotal deposits $ 2,349,977 100.0 % $ 2,392,921 100.0 %\nBorrowings\nFHLB advances were $1.685 billion, or 37% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, as compared to $1.693 billion, or 38% of total\nassets, at December 31, 2023. The Bank continued to manage its wholesale funding mix opportunistically during the first three\nmonths of 2024. During this period, borrowings decreased by $8.0 million, as the Bank used wholesale deposits to replace maturing\nFHLB advances. In late 2023 and early 2024, the Bank slightly extended the duration of its FHLB Classic Advances to capture the\nbenefit of the FHLB curve inversion and, to a lesser extent, to protect against unexpected increases or a slower pace of decline in\nshort-term market rates. Additionally, at March 31, 2024, the Bank had $785.0 million in FHLB HLB-Option Advances outstanding.\nThese are 3-year, 4-year, 5-year and to a lesser extent 7-year maturity fixed rate advances callable quarterly by the FHLB after an\ninitial lockout period of three or six months, which provide the Bank with a lower fixed rate in exchange for the call option granted to\nthe FHLB. At March 31, 2024, the Bank had $110.0 million, $265.0 million, $380.0 million and $30.0 million in HLB-Option\nAdvances outstanding, with original maturities in 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2030, respectively, all of which were past their lockout\nperiods and were callable by the FHLB in the second quarter of 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to ensure the Bank has sufficient liquidity to fund its lending operations, off-balance sheet commitments and contractual\nobligations, the Bank maintains an adequate level of readily available liquidity, both on and off-balance sheet.\nThe Bank also assesses its liquidity position regularly by forecasting incoming and outgoing cash flows. In some cases,\ncontractual maturity dates are used to anticipate cash flows. However, when an asset or liability has no contractual maturity, or is\nsubject to early repayment or redemption at the discretion of the issuer or customer, cash flows can be difficult to predict. Generally,\nthese rights are exercised when it is most financially favorable to the issuer or customer.\nMarketable common equity holdings, although liquid, are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior\nreturns on capital over a longer time horizon.\nInvestment in FHLB stock is illiquid.\nResidential loans are susceptible to principal repayment at the discretion of the borrower. Commercial mortgage loans, while\nsubject to significant penalties for early repayment in most cases, can also prepay at the borrower’s discretion. In the first quarter of\n2024, prepayment rates were significantly lower when compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe Bank invests in key executive life insurance policies that are illiquid during the life of the executive. Such policies totaled\n$13.7 million, or less than 1% of total assets, at March 31, 2024.\nNon-certificate deposit balances can generally be withdrawn from the Bank at any time. The Bank estimates the volatility of its\ndeposits in light of the general economic climate and recent actual experience. Over the past 10 years, deposits have exceeded\n29\nwithdrawals resulting in net cash inflows from depositors.\nTime certificates of deposit, which have predefined maturity dates, have different redemption characteristics based on their nature.\nRetail certificates of deposit, subject to early redemption penalties, can be withdrawn subject to the discretion of the Bank. Internet\nlisting service certificates are offered on the same terms as retail certificates, although the Bank generally does not permit early\nwithdrawal. Brokered certificates generally may not be withdrawn before the stated maturity. The Bank had $1.219 billion in time\ndeposits outstanding at March 31, 2024, of which $1.196 billion have a contractual maturity within one year.\nAt March 31, 2024, $900.0 million of the Bank’s borrowings were fixed in terms of maturity and $785.0 million can be called\nquarterly by the FHLB during the second quarter of 2024. The Bank had no amortizing advances as of March 31, 2024.\nThe Bank also monitors its off-balance sheet items. At March 31, 2024, the Bank had approximately $338.8 million in\ncommitments to extend credit, as compared to $357.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has commitments for data\nprocessing agreements totaling $7.3 million at March 31, 2024.\nThe Bank takes each of these preceding issues into consideration when measuring its liquidity position. Specific measurements\ninclude the Bank’s cash flow position from the 30-day to 365-day horizon, the level of price-sensitive liabilities to earning assets and\nloan to deposit ratios. Additionally, the Bank “shocks” its cash flows by assuming significant cash outflows in both non-certificate\nand certificate deposit balances. At March 31, 2024, each measurement was within predefined Bank guidelines, with the exception of\nthe loan to deposit ratio and the dependency ratio, which were above the guidelines. The loan to deposit ratio has increased in recent\nyears driven primarily by the significant growth in the loan portfolio in 2022, and to a lesser extent in 2023, and the modest deposit\ngrowth by comparison. This ratio has also been impacted by the Bank’s allocation of the wholesale funding mix between wholesale\ndeposits and borrowings - particularly by management’s deliberate efforts to replace maturing Internet listing services time deposits\nwith FHLB advances. The dependency ratio is an internal Bank defined measure of the share of longer term assets funded with\npotentially price-sensitive liabilities and, at March 31, 2024, was above the Bank’s guideline driven by the same factors described\nabove. The Bank’s calculation of the dependency ratio generally treats some portion of certificates of deposit as being potentially price\nsensitive, whereas it does not treat money market funds in the same way. Consequently, the migration of deposits from money market\naccounts to certificates of deposit has also contributed to an increase in the dependency ratio. The Bank continues to carefully manage\nloan growth and focusing on gathering retail and commercial deposits, while maintaining significant on and off-balance sheet\nliquidity.\nThe Bank’s initial source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents which were $373.2 million, or 8% of total assets, at March 31,\n2024. Virtually all cash and cash equivalents are held in overnight cash balances at the FRBB, which are immediately accessible for\nliquidity. The Bank carefully monitors these overnight cash balances to minimize the carrying cost of on-balance sheet liquidity.\nTo supplement its liquidity position, should the need arise, the Bank maintains its membership in the FHLB where it is eligible to\nobtain both short and long-term credit advances and is eligible to access the FRBB discount window. The FHLB does not accept\ncertain types of real estate loans and establishes certain limits on borrowing activity, including a limitation on commercial real estate\ncollateral discounted value up to two times the Bank’s GAAP shareholders’ equity and an overall limit of total extension of credit up\nto 50% of the Bank’s total assets. Effective in March 2024, the overall limit was reduced to 40% of the Bank’s total assets (“40%\ncap”) for all member banks with total assets below $50.0 billion. A dual relationship with the FHLB and FRBB provides the Bank\nwith the flexibility to maximize available capacity and to access immediately available liquidity using the FRBB discount window if\nthe FHLB was unavailable to provide liquidity or were to establish more stringent limits in the future. The Bank actively pledges new\ncollateral as loans are originated and manages the collateral allocation between the FHLB and the FRBB to maximize borrowing\ncapacity. In aggregate, the Bank had available borrowing capacity of $677.8 million from these sources at March 31, 2024, as\ncompared to $598.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to approximately $1.828 billion from the FHLB to meet its borrowing needs,\nbased on the Bank's available qualified collateral which consists primarily of one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, certain\nmultifamily residential property and commercial mortgage loans. At March 31, 2024, the Bank had $1.685 billion in advances\noutstanding from the FHLB and had $138.1 million in available unused capacity (net of accrued interest on outstanding advances).\nThis compares to an unused capacity of $355.1 million at December 31, 2023. The FHLB unused capacity decreased in the first three\nmonths of 2024 as a result of a decrease of $224.6 million in gross FHLB capacity during this period, partially offset by a $8.0 million\ndecrease in outstanding advances. The decline in gross FHLB capacity was a result of the adoption of the 40% cap discussed above,\nwhich resulted in the Bank transferring collateral to the FRBB in the first quarter of 2024.\nAt March 31, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to $540.0 million by accessing the FRBB Discount Window, based on the Bank's\navailable qualified collateral which consists primarily of HELOCs, one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, multifamily\nresidential property and commercial mortgages.and construction loans. The Bank initially obtained approval to pledge HELOCs, and\nin 2023, obtained approval and began pledging commercial and residential real estate loans. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank\nobtained approval to pledge additional loans to the FRBB in anticipation of the FHLB 40% cap adoption, and transferred collateral\nfrom the FHLB to the FRBB. At March 31, 2024 the Bank did not have any advances outstanding at the FRBB and had $540.0\nmillion in available unused capacity.\nThe Bank obtains the necessary capital to support its current and future requirements from the retained earnings generated though\nits operations.\n30\nAt March 31, 2024, the Bank had capital of $414.4 million, or 9.1% of total assets, as compared to $407.6 million, or 9.1% of\ntotal assets, at December 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, stockholders' equity increased by $6.8 million\ndue primarily to net income for the period of $6.9 million and additional capital of $1.3 million associated to stock options exercised,\npartially offset by the declaration of dividends of $0.63 per share, which reduced capital by $1.4 million.\nThe Bank is subject to minimum capital maintenance requirements. Regulatory guidelines define the minimum amount of\nqualifying capital an institution must maintain as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and average total assets. The Bank's ratios\nexceeded these regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following table details the Bank’s actual capital ratios and minimum regulatory ratios as of December 31, 2023 and\nMarch 31, 2024.\nMinimum Minimum To Be Well\nCapital Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Requirement* Corrective Actions Provisions\nAmounts Ratio Amounts Ratio Amounts Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 434,272 13.17 % $ 346,214 10.50 % $ 329,728 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 407,620 12.36 230,810 7.00 214,323 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 407,620 12.36 280,269 8.50 263,782 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 407,620 9.52 171,297 4.00 214,121 5.00\nMarch 31, 2024\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 441,158 13.43 % $ 344,836 10.50 % $ 328,415 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 414,398 12.62 229,890 7.00 213,470 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 414,398 12.62 279,153 8.50 262,732 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 414,398 9.54 173,785 4.00 217,231 5.00\n* Minimum risk-based regulatory capital ratios and amounts at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 include the applicable\nminimum risk-based capital ratios and capital conservation buffer of 2.5%\n31\nItem 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe earnings of most banking institutions are exposed to interest rate risk because their balance sheets, both assets and liabilities,\nare predominantly interest-bearing. It is the Bank's objective to maximize the Bank’s net interest income through the cycle while\nminimizing, to the degree prudently possible, its exposure to interest rate risk, bearing in mind that the Bank, by its very nature, will\nalways be in the business of taking on interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Asset Liability\nCommittee (the “ALCO”) and Board of Directors of the Bank. The ALCO is composed of members of Bank Management and the\nExecutive Committee of the Board. The ALCO establishes and monitors the various components of the balance sheet including\nvolume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets along with funding sources. The goal is to balance liquidity, interest rate risk and\nprofitability. The primary tool used in managing interest rate risk is income simulation modeling. Income simulation modeling\nmeasures changes in net interest income by projecting the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet and applying different\ninterest rate scenarios. Management incorporates numerous assumptions into the simulation model, such as asset prepayment speeds,\nbalance sheet growth and non-maturity deposits elasticity. Management believes that there have been no material changes in the\ninterest rate risk reported in the Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The information is contained in the Form 10-K within the section “Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nItem 4 – Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Bank’s management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness, as of March 31, 2024, of the Bank’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, the\nCEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable\nassurance level.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control\nThere were no significant changes in the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e), during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nBank’s internal control over financial reporting.\n32\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 – Legal Proceedings\nThe Bank is involved, from time to time, as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business and\ntypically related to loan collection activities. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank was not involved in any material legal proceedings the\noutcome of which, if determined in a manner adverse to the Bank, would have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nThere have generally been no material changes to the nature of the risk factors previously disclosed in the Bank’s most recent Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the FDIC.\nItem 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3 – Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4 – Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5 – Other Information\nNone.\nItem 6 – Exhibits\nExhibit No.\n31.1 Certifications – Chief Executive Officer\n31.2 Certifications – Chief Financial Officer\n32.1 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Executive Officer\n32.2 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Financial Officer\n33\nsignatures\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS\nDate: May 8, 2024 /s/\nRobert H.

Gaughen, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nHingham Institution for Savings\nHingham, MA (NASDAQ: HIFS)\nDATE: July 12, 2024\nCONTACT: Patrick R. Gaughen, President and Chief Operating Officer (781) 783-1761\nHINGHAM REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS (NASDAQ: HIFS), Hingham, Massachusetts\nannounced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nEarnings\nNet income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $4,102,000 or $1.88 per share basic and diluted,\nas compared to $8,248,000 or $3.84 per share basic and $3.76 per share diluted for the same period\nlast year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the second quarter of 2024 was 3.92%,\nand the annualized return on average assets was 0.38%, as compared to 8.27% and 0.80% for the\nsame period last year. Net income per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2024 decreased by\n50% compared to the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which represents net income excluding the\nafter-tax gains on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, was $2,181,000 or $1.00 per share\nbasic and per share diluted, as compared to $4,046,000 or $1.88 per share basic and $1.85 per share\ndiluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for the\nsecond quarter of 2024 was 2.08% and the annualized core return on average assets was 0.20%, as\ncompared to 4.06% and 0.39% for the same period last year. Core net income per share (diluted) for\nthe second quarter of 2024 decreased by 46% over the same period in 2023.\nNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $10,970,000 or $5.04 per share basic and\n$5.01 per share diluted, as compared to $16,759,000 or $7.80 per share basic and $7.63 per share\ndiluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the first six\nmonths of 2024 was 5.27%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.50%, as compared to\n8.47% and 0.81% for the same period in 2023. Net income per share (diluted) for the first six months\nof 2024 decreased by 34% over the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which represents net income excluding the\nafter-tax gains on securities, both realized and unrealized, was $4,395,000 or $2.02 per share basic\nand $2.01 per share diluted, as compared to $9,791,000 or $4.56 per share basic and $4.46 per share\ndiluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for the\nfirst six months of 2024 was 2.11%, and the annualized core return on average assets was 0.20%, as\nPage 1 of 10\ncompared to 4.95% and 0.47% for the same period in 2023. Core net income per share (diluted) for\nthe first six months of 2024 decreased by 55% over the same period in 2023.\nSee Page 10 for a reconciliation between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) net\nincome and Non-GAAP core net income. GAAP requires that gains and losses on equity securities,\nnet of tax, realized and unrealized, be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In\ncalculating core net income, the Bank did not make any adjustments other than those relating to\nafter-tax gains on equity securities, realized and unrealized. The Bank did not realize any equity\nsecurities gains or losses in the first six months of 2024.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased to $4.521 billion at June 30, 2024, representing 2% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 5% growth from June 30, 2023.\nNet loans were $3.933 billion at June 30, 2024, representing 1% annualized growth year-to-date and\n5% growth from June 30, 2023. Origination activity was concentrated in the Boston and Washington\nD.C. markets and remained focused on stabilized multifamily commercial real estate and multifamily\nconstruction. The Bank continues to evaluate new opportunities in the San Francisco market, where\ninterest in acquisitions and refinancing activity from the Bank’s customers began to pick up in 2024.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Bank experienced loan prepayments more consistent with historic\ntrends, including the completion and sale of several significant construction projects in Boston and\nWashington, D.C. As noted below, asset quality remained strong.\nRetail and business deposits were $1.921 billion at June 30, 2024, representing 6% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and stable from June 30, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included in retail and\nbusiness deposits, were $343.3 million at June 30, 2024, representing 2% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and a 6% decline from June 30, 2023.\nGrowth in non-interest bearing and money market balances in the first six months of 2024 reflected\nthe Bank’s focus on developing and deepening deposit relationships with new and existing\ncommercial and non-profit customers. Investments in new relationship managers over the last nine\nmonths combined with changes to our marketing approach, continued to contribute to deposit growth\nin the second quarter of 2024. The Bank continues to recruit actively for talented commercial\nbankers in Boston, Washington, and San Francisco, particularly as respected competitors have exited\nthese markets or merged with larger regional banks.\nThe stability of the Bank’s balance sheet, as well as full and unlimited deposit insurance through the\nBank’s participation in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund, continues to be appealing to\ncustomers in times of uncertainty.\nWholesale funds, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, brokered deposits, and\nInternet listing service deposits were $2.146 billion at June 30, 2024, representing a 3% annualized\ndecline year-to-date and 9% growth from June 30, 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the Bank\ncontinued to manage its wholesale funding mix to optimize the cost of funds while taking advantage\nof the inverted yield curve by adding lower rate longer term liabilities. Wholesale deposits, which\ninclude brokered and Internet listing service time deposits, were $497.6 million at June 30, 2024,\nrepresenting 4% annualized growth year-to-date and less than 1% growth from June 30, 2023.\nBorrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $1.649 billion at June 30, 2024, representing a\n5% annualized decline from December 31, 2023, and 12% growth from June 30, 2023. As of June\n30, 2024, the Bank maintained an additional $725.9 million in immediately available borrowing\nPage 2 of 10\ncapacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank, in addition to\n$369.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nBook value per share was $191.34 as of June 30, 2024, representing a 3% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 3% growth from June 30, 2023. In addition to the increase in book value per share,\nthe Bank declared $2.52 in dividends per share since June 30, 2023.\nOn June 26, 2024, the Bank declared a regular cash dividend of $0.63 per share. This dividend will\nbe paid on August 7, 2024 to stockholders of record as of July 29, 2024. This was the Bank’s 122nd\nconsecutive quarterly dividend.\nThe Bank has also generally declared special cash dividends in each of the last twenty-nine years,\ntypically in the fourth quarter, but did not declare a special dividend in 2023. The Bank sets the level\nof the special dividend based on the Bank’s capital requirements and the prospective return on other\ncapital allocation options, particularly the incremental return on capital from new loan originations.\nThis may result in special dividends, if any, significantly above or below the regular quarterly\ndividend. Future regular and special dividends will be considered by the Board of Directors on a\nquarterly basis.\nOperational Performance Metrics\nThe net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 increased 11 basis points to 0.96%, as\ncompared to 0.85% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This reflected a gradual improvement\nthroughout the second quarter and it was the first quarter the net interest margin expanded since the\nFederal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates in early 2022. This improvement was\nprimarily the result of an increase in the yield on earning assets, as the cost of interest-bearing\nliabilities remained relatively stable when compared to the prior quarter. The 13 basis points increase\nin the yield on earning assets was driven primarily by a higher yield on loans, reflecting both an\nincrease in average loan rate - as the Bank continued to originate loans at higher rates and reprice\nexisting loans, as well as higher loan fees. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was up one basis\npoint, as the pace of increase in the Bank’s deposit costs has slowed or reversed in some products and\nthe Bank continued to take advantage of the inverted yield curve by adding lower rate FHLB\nadvances. The net interest margin in the final month of the second quarter of 2024 was 1.03%\nannualized.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the second quarter of 2024. At June 30, 2024,\nnon-performing assets totaled 0.04% of total assets, compared to 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and\n0.00% at June 30, 2023. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled\n0.04% at June 30, 2024, compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 0.00% at June 30, 2023. The\nBank did not record any charge-offs in the first six months of 2024 or 2023. All non-performing\nassets and loans cited above were and are residential, owner-occupant loans.\nThe Bank did not have any delinquent or non-performing commercial real estate loans as of June 30,\n2024, December 31, 2023, or June 30, 2023. The Bank did not own any foreclosed property as of\nJune 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 or June 30, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, as defined on page 5 below, decreased to 68.57% for the second quarter of 2024,\nas compared to 77.24% in the prior quarter, but increased when compared to 55.03% for the same\nperiod last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.67% for the second\nquarter of 2024, as compared to 0.71% for the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be\nsignificantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank utilizes these paired figures\nPage 3 of 10\ntogether to assess its operational efficiency over time. During periods of significant net interest\nincome volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational\nefficiency of the Bank. The Bank remains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of\ncontinuous improvement and standard work that supports operational leverage, positioning the Bank\nto operate more efficiently in future.\nChairman Robert H. Gaughen Jr. stated, “Returns on equity and assets in the second quarter of 2024\nwere significantly lower than our long-term performance, reflecting the challenge from the increase\nin short-term interest rates over the last twenty-four months and a historically long and deep inversion\nof the yield curve. These conditions have posed a significant - albeit ultimately temporary -\nchallenge to our business model. Our core business has been particularly challenged during this\nperiod and our investment operations have been critical to sustaining growth in book value per share\nin this environment.\nThis challenge will begin to fade this year, as our assets continue to reprice. Where the yield curve\nremains inverted, we will continue to capitalize on it via our wholesale funding activities.\nWhile this market environment has been extraordinarily challenging, the Bank’s business model has\nbeen built over time to compound shareholder capital through economic cycles. During all such\nperiods, we remain focused on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting and disciplined cost\ncontrol - the building blocks for compounding shareholder capital through all stages of the economic\ncycle. These remain constant, regardless of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. I\nbelieve that over the past twenty-four months we have retained this focus and it will serve us well as\nwe begin to emerge from this challenge.”\nThe Bank’s quarterly financial results are summarized in this earnings release, but shareholders are\nencouraged to read the Bank’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is generally available several\nweeks after the earnings release. The Bank expects to file Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,\n2024 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on or about August 7, 2024.\nIncorporated in 1834, Hingham Institution for Savings is one of America’s oldest banks. The Bank\nmaintains offices in Boston, Nantucket, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\nThe Bank’s shares of common stock are listed and traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the\nsymbol HIFS.\nPage

Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2024\nNOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated interim financial statements of Hingham Institution for Savings (the “Bank”) have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial statements and\nwith the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nFinancial information as of June 30, 2024, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, is unaudited and, in\nthe opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information. Such adjustments were of a\nnormal recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. The unaudited\ninterim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Bank\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on Form 10-K.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2016-13 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ”\n(“ASC 326”) This new guidance, also referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) method, replaced the incurred loss\nmethod that was utilized in estimating the Bank’s allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) as of December 31, 2022. Under CECL, the\nBank is required to estimate credit losses expected to occur over the life of the financial instrument and to recognize those estimated\nlosses at the time of loan origination.\nThe Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method; therefore, results for reporting periods beginning on or\nafter January 1, 2023 are presented in accordance with this new guidance while prior period results are reported in accordance with the\npreviously applicable U.S. GAAP. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023 and recorded a $545,000 increase in the\nBank’s ALL for outstanding loans and no change in the reserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments, resulting in a total increase\nin the Bank’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) of $545,000. The transition adjustment, net of related tax effects, was recorded as a\ncumulative effect from the change in accounting principle and reduced the Bank’s retained earnings by $392,000.\nThe following table shows the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13.\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAs Reported Under Pre-adoption of Impact of\nASU 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 Adoption\n(In Thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses $ 25,534 $ 24,989 $ 545\nReserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments — — —\nDeferred tax asset 4,061 3,908 153\nRetained earnings 370,366 370,758 (392)\nThe amounts presented for the ACL in the table above reflect changes associated to the Bank’s loan portfolio as of adoption date.\nThe Bank also held $3.5 million in held-to-maturity debt securities as of the adoption date which, based upon management’s\nevaluation, did not require an ACL. The Bank did not hold any securities available-for-sale as of the adoption date.\nManagement also evaluated the Bank’s unfunded commitments, which at the adoption date, included primarily construction loans\nand commercial real estate lines of credit, and determined, based upon an evaluation of probability of funding and risk of loss, that the\nrequired reserve was not material.\nEarnings per common share\nBasic earnings per share represent income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive\npotential shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential shares\nthat may be issued by the Bank relate solely to outstanding stock options and are determined using the treasury stock method. The\namount of excess tax benefit that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the options is not considered in\nthe proceeds when applying the treasury stock method.\n9\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEarnings per common share have been computed based on the following:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nAverage number of shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings\nper share 2,149 2,180 2,148 2,175\nEffect of dilutive options 42 6 48 14\nAverage number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings\nper share 2,191 2,186 2,196 2,189\nThere were 1,000 antidilutive options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 16,000 antidilutive\noptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe Bank groups its assets measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the\nreliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 1 assets generally include debt and\nequity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for\nmarket transactions involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; quoted prices\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the\nfair value of the assets. Level 3 assets include those whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets for which the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\nLoans\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio includes residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, home equity, commercial and\nconsumer segments. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in the eastern Massachusetts area. The Bank\nalso lends to commercial real estate borrowers in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and in the San Francisco\nBay Area (“SFBA”). The ability of the Bank's debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon real estate, construction, and general\neconomic conditions in these markets.\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at the\namount of their outstanding principal, including deferred loan origination fees and costs, reduced by unearned discounts, and the ACL.\nInterest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred\nand recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method.\nAccrued interest is presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial\nloans is discontinued at the time a loan is 90 days past due (the loan is in default) unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Personal loans are typically charged off no later than becoming 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual\nterms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is\nconsidered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income.\nThe interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status.\nLoans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future\npayments are reasonably assured.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Bank’s ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged against income. All, or portions of, loans deemed to\nbe uncollectible are charged against the ACL when the Bank believes that collectability of all, or some portion of, outstanding\nprincipal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, of loans previously charged off are credited to the ACL when collected.\n10\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLosses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life\nof the loan balance as of the period end date. The ACL is evaluated quarterly by management and is maintained at a level the Bank\nbelieves will be adequate to absorb expected credit losses in future periods associated with its loan portfolio and unfunded loan\ncommitments as of the period end date. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to\nsignificant revision as more information becomes available. The Bank’s CECL methodology consists of quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents, as described below. This methodology applies to the Bank’s real estate loan portfolio, which at June 30, 2024, comprised\nvirtually 100% of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Consumer and commercial loans that are not secured by real estate are evaluated\nqualitatively.\nFor the quantitative component, the Bank uses an undiscounted cash flow probability-of-default (“PD”) / loss-given-default\n(“LGD”) method, forecasted based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers and using a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast (national unemployment rate). Given the minimal level of loan losses experienced by the Bank over recent\ndecades, the Bank uses statistical data derived from a large group of community banks’ loss experience (“Index”), which incorporates\na combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available. This process includes estimates\nwhich involve projecting loan prepayments, PD and LGD throughout the life of the loan. The PD component is driven by the Call\nReport code and risk rating of the loan (Pass, Watch, Special Mention or Substandard), while the LGD component is driven by the\nCall Report code. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is determined based upon the reasonableness and level of national\nunemployment rate forecast estimates. For periods beyond a reasonable and supportable forecast time frame, the Bank reverts to\nhistorical information over a period for which comparable data is available. In determining the ACL, the Bank utilizes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period which, as of June 30, 2024, was two years followed by a one year mean reversion period. These\nassumptions are reviewed periodically to determine whether they remain appropriate.\nFor the qualitative component, management performs an assessment beyond model estimates, and applies qualitative adjustments\nas deemed necessary. The qualitative components of the ACL consider (i) the Bank’s idiosyncratic lending program attributes to\nwhich management ascribe the Bank’s lower historical losses versus the Index and the industry during periods of stress, such as\nsponsor/borrower quality, collateral valuation approach and loan-to-value, loan structure (contractual provisions, recourse to borrower)\nand collection process, among others; (ii) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios; (iii) certain portfolio characteristics, such as\nportfolio growth, concentrations of credit and delinquencies; (iv) national and local economic and industry conditions which may\naffect borrowers’ ability to pay and/or real estate values and (v) model limitations; among others.\nThe Bank segments its loan receivable population into homogeneous pools of loans which share similar risk characteristics.\nWhen a loan no longer meets the criteria of its initial pooling as a result of credit deterioration or other changes, the Bank may\nevaluate the credit for estimated losses on an individual basis. For loans with real estate collateral, when management determines that\nforeclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling\ncosts as appropriate. While an individual assessment and related ACL may be calculated for non-performing loans, no portion of the\nBank’s ACL is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire ACL is available to absorb losses from any and all\nloans, including unfunded loan commitments.\nResidential real estate – The Bank generally does not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80% (without private\nmortgage insurance). All loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate that is owner-occupied at the time of\norigination and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including\nunemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans\nin Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nCommercial real estate – Loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties throughout Massachusetts, the\nWMA and the SFBA. Underwriting and portfolio management policies are the same across all markets. Loan amounts do not exceed\n75% of the appraised value of the collateral. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties could be adversely impacted by a\ndownturn in the economy leading to increased vacancy rates which, in turn, would have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.\nManagement obtains rent rolls annually and regularly monitors the cash flows of these loans.\nConstruction – Loans in this segment include both owner-occupied and speculative real estate development loans for which payment\nis derived from sale of the property. Credit risk could be affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, the overall health\nof the economy and market conditions. The Bank only originates these loans in Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nHome equity – Loans in this segment include equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans, and are generally collateralized by\nsecond liens on residential real estate. Repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The Bank generally\ndoes not originate loans with combined loan-to-value ratios greater than 70% when taking into account both the balance of the home\nequity loans and the first mortgage loan. Similar to residential real estate, the overall health of the economy, including unemployment\nrates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans in\nMassachusetts. The Bank will not originate these loans unless it holds the senior lien position on the collateral property.\n11\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCommercial – Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is\nexpected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect\non the credit quality in this segment. These loans are not a focus of the Bank’s origination program and are only originated in\nMassachusetts.\nConsumer – Loans in this segment are generally unsecured lines of credit and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the\nindividual borrower. The Bank is no longer offering these loans.\nThe Bank has elected not to measure an ACL on accrued interest and to write off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a\ntimely manner.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are measured over the contractual period of the Bank’s exposure to credit\nrisk. The estimate of credit loss incorporates assumptions for both the likelihood and amount of funding over the estimated life of the\ncommitments, for the risk of loss, and current conditions and expectations. Management periodically reviews and updates the\nassumptions.\nLeases\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases , the Bank records operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)\nassets and operating lease liabilities relating to operating leases for some of its banking offices. These lease agreements have lease\nand non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The ROU asset is included in other assets and the operating\nlease liability is included in other liabilities on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2024, the ROU asset was\n$265,000 and the corresponding operating lease liability was $287,000. Operating lease costs for both the quarters ended June 30,\n2023 and 2024 were $61,000. Operating lease costs for both the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were $122,000.\nThe maturities of lease liabilities are as follows at June 30, 2024:\nYears Amount\n(In Thousands)\n2024 (remaining six months) $ 111\n2025 146\n2026 37\nTotal lease payments 294\nImputed interest (7)\nTotal lease liability $ 287\nNOTE 2: COMMITMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, outstanding loan commitments were as follows:\nDecember 31, June 30,\n2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nUnused lines of credit $ 154,917 $ 157,181\nCommitments to originate loans 56,462 29,190\nUnadvanced funds on construction loans 145,910 99,190\nStandby letters-of-credit 105 105\nTotal $ 357,394 $ 285,666\nNOTE 3: DIVIDEND DECLARATION\nOn June 26, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share to all stockholders of record as of July 29,\n2024, payable on August 7, 2024.\n12\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNOTE 4: FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nDetermination of Fair Value\nThe Bank uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances,\nthere are no quoted market prices for the Bank’s assets and liabilities. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalues are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the\nassumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be\nrealized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. There are no liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nEquity securities $ 71,517 $ 8,285 $ — $ 79,802\nJune 30, 2024\nEquity securities $ 80,717 $ 11,865 $ — $ 92,582\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nThe Bank may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of\nindividual assets.\nThere are no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024.\n13\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSummary of Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe estimated fair values, determined using the exit price notion, and related carrying amounts, of the Bank’s financial\ninstruments are as follows.

This category includes loans on the\nBank’s watchlist that do not warrant a lower rating.\nLoans rated 4 : Loans in this category are considered “special mention.” These loans are currently protected, but exhibit conditions\nthat have the potential for weakness. The borrower may be affected by unfavorable economic, market or other external conditions that\nmay affect their ability to repay the debt. These may also include credits where there is deterioration of the collateral or have\ndeficiencies which may affect our ability to collect on the collateral. This rating is consistent with the “Other Assets Especially\nMentioned” category used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).\n17\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLoans rated 5 : Loans in this category are considered “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately\nprotected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that\nthe Bank will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.\nLoans rated 6 : Loans in this category are considered “doubtful.” Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in\nthose classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of\ncurrently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans rated 7 : Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is\nnot warranted.\nCommercial real estate loans are assigned an initial risk rating by the Bank at the origination of the loan. Subsequently, the Bank\nhas a quality control program performed by an independent third party. Quarterly, all new commercial real estate, construction and\nresidential real estate loan relationships with outstanding balances or commitments of $500,000 or more are reviewed and assigned a\nrisk rating. On a rolling quarterly basis, an in-depth review is performed on all commercial real estate relationships (and related\nresidential loans) with exposure in excess of $850,000 and all loans on the Bank’s watchlist. Commercial real estate relationships (and\nrelated residential loans) with exposure between $500,000 and $850,000 are reviewed at least annually. Watchlist loans are those\nloans that are more than two payments past due at the end of the quarter, loans for which the borrowing entity or sponsor has filed\nbankruptcy, loans rated four or higher in a previous review, impaired loans, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, and loans past contractual maturity. Results of the independent loan review are reported to the Bank’s Audit\nCommittee on a quarterly basis and become the mechanism for monitoring the overall credit quality of the portfolio.\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of December 31, 2023:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,083 $ 239,232 $ — $ — $ 492,508\n4 — — — — 161 1,363 — — 1,524\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,244 $ 240,595 $ — $ — $ 494,032\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n18\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (concluded)\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of June 30, 2024:\nAs of June 30, 2024\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 10,535 $ 29,230 $ 38,552 $ 72,744 $ 62,525 $ 262,825 $ — $ — $ 476,411\n4 — — — — — 1,694 — — 1,694\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 10,535 $ 29,230 $ 38,552 $ 72,744 $ 62,525 $ 264,519 $ — $ — $ 478,105\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 66,313 $ 271,123 $ 895,511 $ 836,297 $ 463,201 $ 616,440 $ 56,488 $ — $ 3,205,373\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 66,313 $ 271,123 $ 895,511 $ 836,297 $ 463,201 $ 616,440 $ 56,488 $ — $ 3,205,373\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 19,998 $ 74,674 $ 137,674 $ 18,304 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 250,650\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n— — — — — — — — —\n5\nTotal $ 19,998 $ 74,674 $ 137,674 $ 18,304 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 250,650\nResidential real estate loans are rated 1-3B at origination with subsequent adjustments based on delinquency or upon review if\nincluded in the scope of the Bank’s loan review process described above.

Matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our\npublic disclosures, whether written or oral, relating to future events or our future performance, including any discussion, expressed or\nimplied, of our anticipated growth, operating results, future earnings per share, plans and objectives, contain forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThese statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “continue,” “intend,” “expect,”\n“future,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact. These statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including changes in political and\neconomic climate, interest rate fluctuations and competitive product and pricing pressures within the Bank’s market, bond market\nfluctuations, personal and corporate customers’ bankruptcies and inflation. Our actual results and timing of certain events could differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those\nset forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings with the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). It is routine for internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter\nin the year progresses and, therefore, it should be clearly understood that all forward-looking statements and the internal projections\nand beliefs upon which we base our expectations included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may change. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the\nfuture, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Bank’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments\ninvolving significant estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of its accounting policies about the effects of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and\nchanges in this information over time could materially impact amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements as a result of\nthe use of different estimates and assumptions. Certain accounting policies, by their nature, have a greater reliance on the use of\nestimates and assumptions and could produce results materially different from those originally reported.\nBased on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates and assumptions underlying reported amounts,\nthe most significant accounting estimate followed by the Bank has been identified by management as the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”). This policy requires the most subjective and complex judgments and, as such, could be most\nsubject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying\nthis accounting estimate is essential in order to understand the Bank’s reported financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which impacted the Bank’s methodology for estimating the ACL. This accounting\npolicy and its application in recent periods is described in more detail in the “Provision for Credit Losses” section of this discussion\nand analysis and in Note 1 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements”\nelsewhere in this report.\nIn developing the ACL estimate, management considers historical charge-offs, loan-to-value ratios, underlying collateral values,\npayment history, the size of the loan portfolio and the risks associated with certain loan types as well as other factors such as local\neconomic trends, market conditions and credit concentrations. The Bank’s ACL estimate is determined using a probability-of-default\n/ loss-given default undiscounted cash flow model (“Model”), adjusted by management’s qualitative factors. Given the Bank’s long\nterm history of immaterial net charge-offs, the Model relies on statistical information derived from the loss experience of an index\ncomposed of other community banks, and is largely dependent on management’s qualitative factors, which are determined based on\nthe elements described above. Therefore, the estimate is sensitive to the Model’s parameters and assumptions, and management’s\nsubjectivity in the assessment of the qualitative factors.\nIf management’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the ACL is inadequate to absorb expected losses, or if\nbank regulatory authorities require the Bank to increase the ACL as a part of their examination process, the Bank’s earnings and\ncapital could be significantly and adversely affected.\nNote on Core Return on Average Equity and Core Return on Average Assets\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities , equity securities (except those\naccounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income, regardless of\nwhether such gains and losses are realized, and included in the other income (loss) category. This change affects the Bank’s portfolio\n20\nof marketable equity securities, which includes common equity securities and a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify\nfor the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) securities test. This portfolio primarily includes common equity investments, which\nthe Bank views as long-term partnership interests in operating companies. Consequently, the Bank does not view the quarterly\nfluctuation in market value as indicative of the change in the intrinsic value of these portfolio holdings. The performance of these\nholdings should be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to growth in book value per share over time, not via quarterly\nadjustments to net income.\nConsistent with this view, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nincorporates core net income, core return on average equity, and core return on average assets, which are non-U.S. GAAP\nmeasurements that exclude the after-tax effect of gain (loss) on equity securities, net, both realized and unrealized. These disclosures\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable to non-U.S. GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between net income and core net income for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNon-U.S. GAAP reconciliation:\nNet Income $ 8,248 $ 4,102 $ 16,759 $ 10,970\n(Gain) on equity securities, net (5,390) (2,464) (8,938) (8,434)\nIncome tax expense (1) 1,188 543 1,970 1,859\nCore Net Income $ 4,046 $ 2,181 $ 9,791 $ 4,395\n(1) The equity securities are held in a tax-advantaged subsidiary corporation. The income tax effect of the gain on equity securities,\nnet, was calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to the subsidiary.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents total operating expenses, divided by the sum of net interest income and total other income,\nexcluding gain on equity securities, net, is a non-U.S. GAAP performance measure used by management to assess operational\nefficiency. The table below presents the calculation of the efficiency ratio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNon-U.S. GAAP efficiency ratio calculation:\nOperating expenses $ 7,324 $ 7,294 $ 14,306 $ 14,521\nNet interest income $ 13,030 $ 10,368 $ 27,941 $ 19,452\nOther income 5,668 2,733 9,500 8,976\nGain on equity securities, net (5,390) (2,464) (8,938) (8,434)\nTotal revenue $ 13,308 $ 10,637 $ 28,503 $ 19,994\nEfficiency ratio 55.03 % 68.57 % 50.19 % 72.63 %\nAs the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank also utilizes annualized\noperating expenses as a percentage of average assets to evaluate operational efficiency.\nINTRODUCTION\nNet income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $4,102,000 or $1.88 per share basic and diluted, as compared to $8,248,000\nor $3.84 per share basic and $3.76 per share diluted in earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The Bank’s annualized return on\naverage equity for the second quarter of 2024 was 3.92%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.38%, as compared to\n8.27% and 0.80% for the same period in 2023. Core net income for the second quarter of 2024, which represents net income\nexcluding the after-tax gain on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, was $2,181,000 or $1.00 per share basic and diluted,\nrepresenting an annualized core return on average equity of 2.08% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.20%. This\ncompares to core net income of $4,046,000 or $1.88 per share basic and $1.85 per share diluted, representing an annualized core\nreturn on average equity of 4.06% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.39% for the same period in 2023.\nNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $10,970,000 or $5.04 per share basic and $5.01 per share diluted as\ncompared to $16,759,000 or $7.80 per share basic and $7.63 per share diluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized\nreturn on average equity for the first six months of 2024 was 5.27%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.50%, as\n21\ncompared to 8.47% and 0.81% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities, both realized and\nunrealized, core net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $4,395,000 or $2.02 per share basic and $2.01 per share\ndiluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 2.11% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.20%.\nThis compares to core net income of $9,791,000 or $4.56 per share basic and $4.46 per share diluted, representing an annualized core\nreturn on average equity of 4.95% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.47% for the same period in 2023.\nThe net interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 32 basis points to 0.96%, as compared to 1.28% for the same\nperiod in 2023. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the prior year.\nThis was driven primarily by the repricing of the Bank’s wholesale borrowings, wholesale deposits and higher rates on the Bank’s\nretail and commercial deposits. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was partially offset by a higher yield on\ninterest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n(“FRBB”), a higher Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB”) stock dividend and an increase in the yield on loans.\nThe net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased 46 basis points to 0.91%, as compared to 1.37% for the\nsame period last year. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the\nprior year. This was driven primarily by the repricing of the Bank’s wholesale borrowings, wholesale deposits and higher rates on the\nBank’s retail and commercial deposits. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was partially offset by a higher yield on\ninterest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the interest on reserves held at the FRBB, a higher FHLB stock dividend and\nan increase in the yield on loans.\nTotal assets increased by $36.8 million from December 31, 2023 and $210.0 million from June 30, 2023, representing 2%\nannualized growth year-to-date and 5% growth from June 30, 2023. Net loans increased by $19.2 million from December 31, 2023\nand $171.8 million from June 30, 2023, representing 1% annualized growth year-to-date and 5% growth from June 30, 2023. Total\ndeposits, including wholesale deposits, increased to $2.418 billion at June 30, 2024, representing 6% annualized growth year-to-date\nand relatively stable from June 30, 2023. Total retail and business deposits increased to $1.921 billion at June 30, 2024, representing\n6% annualized growth year-to-date and relatively stable from June 30, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included in retail and\nbusiness deposits, increased to $343.3 million at June 30, 2024, representing a 2% annualized growth year-to-date and a 6% decline\nfrom June 30, 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the Bank continued to focus on developing and deepening deposit relationships\nwith new and existing commercial and non-profit customers, retaining maturing time deposit balances, and managing its wholesale\nfunding mix between wholesale time deposits and FHLB advances in order to mitigate the negative impact of elevated short term rates\nin the cost of funds.\nStockholders’ equity increased to $417.2 million as of June 30, 2024, representing 5% annualized growth year-to-date and a 4%\nincrease from June 30, 2023. Book value per share increased to $191.34 per share at June 30, 2024, from $188.50 per share at\nDecember 31, 2023 and $185.94 per share at June 30, 2023. Since June 30, 2023, the Bank declared dividends of $2.52 per share.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the second quarter of 2024. At June 30, 2024, non-performing assets\ntotaled 0.04% of total assets, compared with 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and 0.00% at June 30, 2023. Non-performing loans as a\npercentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.04% at June 30, 2024, as compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 0.00% at June\n30, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents total operating expenses, divided by the sum of net interest income and total other income,\nexcluding gain on equity securities, net, increased to 68.57% for the second quarter of 2024, as compared to 55.03% in the same\nperiod last year. Operating expenses (annualized) as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.67% for the second quarter of 2024, as\ncompared to 0.71% for the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest\nincome, the Bank utilizes these paired figures together to assess its operational efficiency over time. During periods of significant net\ninterest income volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational efficiency of the Bank.\nThe Bank remains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of continuous improvement and standard work that supports\noperational leverage. These figures reflect the Bank’s continued focus on credit quality and disciplined expense management.\nThe Bank continues to exceed all of the minimum regulatory capital requirements.\n22\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024 AND 2023\nGeneral\nThe Bank reported net income of $4.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $8.2 million for the quarter\nended June 30, 2023. Net income was $1.88 per share basic and diluted for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $3.84 per\nshare basic and $3.76 per share diluted for the same period in 2023. Earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were negatively\nimpacted by a decrease of $2.7 million in net interest income and a decrease of $2.9 million in other income, partially offset by a\n$270,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses, a decrease of $1.2 million in the income tax provision and a $30,000 decrease in\noperating expenses. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 3.92%, and the\nannualized return on average assets was 0.38%, compared to 8.27% and 0.80%, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the second quarter of 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities,\nboth realized and unrealized, was $2.2 million or $1.00 per share basic and diluted, representing an annualized core return on average\nequity of 2.08% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.20%. This compares to core net income of $4.0 million or $1.88\nper share basic and $1.85 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 4.06% and an annualized core\nreturn on average assets of 0.39% for the same period in 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $10.4 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $13.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. The $2.7\nmillion decrease was due to a 41 basis point decrease in the weighted average spread, partially offset by a $227.7 million, or 6%,\nincrease in average interest-earning assets in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024, the weighted average rate spread and net interest margin were 0.25% and 0.96%, respectively, compared\nto 0.66% and 1.28%, respectively, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $238.1\nmillion, or 7% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 85 basis points during the same period.\nIn early 2022, after a sustained period of lower short term market rates, the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities began to\nmove up sharply following the increase in short term market interest rates. This trend, which accelerated in the second half of 2022\nand in 2023, began to abate in 2024. The higher average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a higher average\nyield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the yield on loans and an increase in the interest on reserves held at\nthe FRBB. This resulted in a significantly lower net interest margin in the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $7.1 million to $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, as compared to $42.0\nmillion for the second quarter of 2023, driven by the increase in average interest-earning assets discussed above. The yield on total\ninterest-earning assets was 4.56% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 4.12% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased by $6.9 million when comparing the two periods, primarily resulting from a 7% increase in\naverage loan balances, combined with a 43 basis point increase in yield. The increase in yield was driven primarily by a higher yield\non loans, reflecting both an increase in average loan rate - as the Bank continued to originate loans at higher rates and reprice existing\nloans, as well as higher loan fees.\nSecurities and short-term investments, which include the Bank’s cash holdings at the FRBB, accounted for 7% of the total average\ninterest-earning assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as the Bank continued\nto manage its balance sheet to reduce the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. This was partially offset by an increase in the\nfair value of the Bank’s equity securities portfolio when compared to the prior year. Combined income for these categories increased\nby $146,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to higher average yields, partially offset by a $26.7 million decrease in\ncombined average balances. The decrease in the Bank's cash held at the FRBB as a percentage of interest-earning assets was partially\noffset by a higher interest rate paid on excess reserves. Also, the dividend on the Bank’s stock investment at the FHLB increased\nduring the period, driven by a larger average balance of FHLB stock and a higher dividend yield.\nThe average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.31% for the second quarter of 2024 from 3.46% for the comparable\nquarter of 2023. Total interest expense increased by $9.7 million when comparing the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 due to\nhigher interest rates on deposits and borrowings, combined with higher aggregate average balances.\nInterest expense on deposits for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $5.3 million over the same period in 2023, due to a 106\nbasis point increase in the weighted average rate, partially offset by a decrease of $46.8 million in average interest-bearing deposits.\nAfter a sustained period of historically low short term rates, beginning in early 2022 the Bank observed rising market pricing for term\ndeposits, money market accounts, and wholesale funds. This trend, which was sustained during 2022 and 2023, began to abate in\n2024. The Bank continued to manage core product rates, implemented special offerings, and continued to use wholesale time deposits\nto remain competitive while balancing cost versus growth.\nInterest expense on borrowed funds for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $4.4 million as compared to the same quarter in\n2023, primarily due to a 38 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, combined with a $284.9 million increase in average\nbalances. The increase in the FHLB borrowings rate was primarily driven by the higher short-term market rates, partially offset by the\nhigher average balance of lower rate FHLB HLB-Option advances in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in\n2023. The FHLB provides an explanation of HLB-Option Advances on its website under the “Products” section that explains the\n23\nfeatures of this product.\nThe following tables detail components of net interest income and yields/rates on daily average earning assets/liabilities.\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2024\nAVERAGE YIELD/ AVERAGE YIELD/\nBALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9) BALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9)\n(In Thousands)\nLoans (1) (2) $ 3,725,717 $ 37,806 4.06 % $ 3,980,111 $ 44,665 4.49 %\nSecurities (3) (4) 103,153 1,077 4.18 119,477 1,638 5.48\nFederal Reserve and other short-term investments 245,426 3,106 5.06 202,379 2,745 5.43\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,074,296 41,989 4.12 4,301,967 49,048 4.56\nOther assets 56,658 66,218\nTotal assets $ 4,130,954 $ 4,368,185\nInterest-bearing deposits (5) $ 2,196,558 16,808 3.06 $ 2,149,753 22,141 4.12\nBorrowed funds 1,152,473 12,151 4.22 1,437,335 16,539 4.60\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,349,031 28,959 3.46 3,587,088 38,680 4.31\nDemand deposits 371,262 346,663\nOther liabilities 11,636 15,503\nTotal liabilities 3,731,929 3,949,254\nStockholders’ equity 399,025 418,931\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,130,954 $ 4,368,185\nNet interest income $ 13,030 $ 10,368\nWeighted average spread 0.66 % 0.25 %\nNet interest margin (6) 1.28 % 0.96 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average\ninterest-bearing liabilities (7) 121.66 % 119.93 %\n(1) Before allowance for credit losses.\n(2) Includes average non-accrual loans.\n(3) Excludes the impact of the average net unrealized gain or loss on securities.\n(4) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n(5) Includes mortgagors' escrow accounts.\n(6) Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(7) Total interest-earning assets divided by total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8) Average balances are calculated on a daily basis.\n(9) Annualized.\nThe following table presents information regarding changes in interest and dividend income and interest expense of the Bank for\nthe periods indicated.

The Bank determined that a $545,000 adjustment to increase the allowance\nfor credit losses and no reserve for unfunded commitments was required upon adoption. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nAt June 30, 2024, management's review of the allowance for credit losses concluded that a balance of $26.9 million was adequate\nto provide for losses based upon evaluation of risk in the loan portfolio. During the second quarter of 2024, management provided\n$180,000 to achieve such an allowance for credit loss balance at June 30, 2024. Comparably, at June 30, 2023, management’s\nevaluation of the balance of the allowance for loan losses indicated the need for a quarterly provision of $450,000. Credit quality\nremained strong with no delinquent or non performing commercial real estate loans as of June 30, 2024. The Bank did not record any\ncharge-offs in the second quarters of 2024 or 2023.\nSee Notes 1 and 6 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and “Loans and Foreclosed Real Estate”\nincluded in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information pertaining to the allowance for credit losses.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of gain on equity securities, net, customer service fees on deposits, increases in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance policies and miscellaneous income. Total other income was $2.7 million for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to other income of $5.7 million for the same period in 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank\nrecorded gains totaling $2.5 million on equity securities, comprised solely of unrealized gains on equity securities held at the end of\nthe period. In the second quarter of 2023, the Bank recorded gains totaling $5.4 million on equity securities, comprised solely of\nunrealized gains on equity securities held at the end of the period.\nCustomer service fees on deposits decreased marginally in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In\nrecent years, there has been a continuous decline in deposit account transaction fees, as the Bank has eliminated many fees on deposit\nproducts to simplify offerings and enhance the value proposition of our consumer and business checking accounts to customers.\nGenerally, the Bank’s strategy does not rely on generating substantial non-interest fee-based revenue from our deposit accounts.\nAn increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance also contributed to other income during the second quarters\nof 2024 and 2023. The Bank held $13.8 million in life insurance policies at June 30, 2024 as compared to $13.5 million at June 30,\n2023. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. Income from these assets is fully\nexcludable from federal income taxes and contributed $82,000 to other income in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to $83,000\nfor the same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, deposit insurance,\nmarketing, foreclosure and related, and other general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses were $7.3 million, or an\nannualized 0.67% of average total assets, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $7.3 million, or an annualized 0.71% of\naverage total assets, for the same period of 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses increased by $49,000, or 1%, in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023, primarily due to annual merit-based salary increases, enhancements to our operational teams and higher payroll\ntaxes, partially offset by reductions in executive pay implemented during 2023. The number of employees increased, reflecting\nadditional staff in our Specialized Deposit Group (“SDG”) and operational teams, partially offset by a smaller branch staff.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses increased by $14,000, or 4%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher depreciation expenses, as the Bank made improvements to the corporate\noffices, which were completed in the second half of 2023. Lower rental income recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2024\nalso contributed to the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The Bank owns rental apartments located above its Nantucket\nbranch which are rented during the summer season.\nData processing expenses for the second quarter of 2024 decreased by $8,000, or 1%, when compared to the same period in 2023,\ndriven primarily by the elimination of duplicate systems, partially offset by higher data processing charges associated with\nimprovements made to the Bank's systems and volume increases in 2024. Technology spending at the Bank remains focused on three\nprimary objectives: delivering new or improved customer experience, reducing costs through simplification and automation of internal\nprocesses, and securing customer and Bank confidential information.\nDeposit insurance expense for the second quarter of 2024 increased by $229,000, or 39%, when compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase was the result of a higher assessed rate, combined with a larger assessment base, driven by the Bank’s balance\nsheet growth. Deposit insurance expense consists of premiums paid to the FDIC and the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund\n(“DIF”). The FDIC assessment rate is determined based on several factors, including capitalization, asset growth, earnings, use of\nbrokered deposits and level of non-performing assets, among others, and is calculated on an assessment base that takes into\nconsideration the Bank’s average total assets and average tangible equity, among other factors. The DIF assessment rate is based on\nan institution’s risk category, which is defined based on similar factors. Effective the first quarterly assessment period of 2023, the\nFDIC implemented a system-wide increase that applied to all banks, which increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate\nby 2 basis points. This is part of a long-planned effort by the FDIC to return the funded status of the FDIC insurance fund to a higher\n25\nlevel. The Bank carefully manages its balance sheet to control the deposit insurance expense associated with excess liquidity while\noptimizing its funding mix.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $90,000, or 32%, for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as the\nBank continues to carefully manage these expenses focusing on business development for the Bank’s Commercial Real Estate Group\nand SDG. The Bank continued to allocate its marketing spending during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 towards supporting its\ncommercial deposit acquisition activities in Boston, the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and the San Francisco\nBay Area (“SFBA”).\nForeclosure and related expenses include expenses associated with the collection and foreclosure process, such as legal, tax,\nappraisal, insurance and other related foreclosure expenses. These expenses may be recovered when the loan returns to performing\nstatus or when the Bank exercises its remedies, as they are generally secured by the Bank’s mortgages. Such recoveries, if any, are\nreflected in future periods as contra-expense. The Bank recorded $14,000 in foreclosure and related expenses in the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024 as compared to $26,000 in the same period in 2023. At June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the Bank\ndid not own any foreclosed property.\nOther general and administrative expenses, which include director fees, supplies, deposit/card related losses and audit-related\nexpenses, among others, decreased by $212,000, or 19%, when comparing the two periods, reflecting lower supplies, loan-related,\ntravel and legal expenses, partially offset by higher insurance and audit-related expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Bank recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established\nfor the temporary difference between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. The Bank's deferred tax asset\nis reviewed quarterly by management as to the realizability of such asset.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded $1.5 million, or 27.1% of pre-tax income, in tax expense as compared to\n$2.7 million, or 24.5%, for the same quarter in 2023. The higher effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower unrealized gains\non equity securities recognized during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, as these securities\nare held at a tax-advantaged subsidiary. The Bank did not recognize excess tax benefit on the exercise of stock options in the second\nquarter of 2024, as compared to $102,000 in the second quarter of 2023.\n26\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024 AND 2023\nGeneral\nThe Bank reported net income of $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $16.8 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. Net income was $5.04 per share basic and $5.01 per share diluted for the first six months ended June 30,\n2024 as compared to $7.80 per share basic and $7.63 per share diluted for the same period in 2023. Earnings for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by a decrease of $8.5 million in net interest income, a decrease of $524,000 in other income,\nand a $215,000 increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a $318,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses and a decrease\nof $3.1 million in the income tax provision. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the six months ended June 30, 2024\nwas 5.27%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.50%, compared to 8.47% and 0.81%, respectively, for the same period\nin 2023.\nCore net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gain on equity\nsecurities, both realized and unrealized, was $4.4 million or $2.02 per share basic and $2.01 per share diluted, representing an\nannualized core return on average equity of 2.11% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.20%. This compares to core\nnet income of $9.8 million or $4.56 per share basic and $4.46 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average\nequity of 4.95% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.47% for the same period in 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $19.5 million for the first six months of 2024 as compared to $27.9 million for the first six months of\n2023. The $8.5 million decrease was due to a 60 basis point decrease in the weighted average spread, partially offset by a $215.8\nmillion, or 5%, increase in average interest-earning assets in the first six months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For\nthe first six months of 2024, the weighted average rate spread and net interest margin were 0.19% and 0.91%, respectively, as\ncompared to 0.79% and 1.37%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $228.8\nmillion, or 7% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 104 basis points during the same period.\nIn early 2022, after a sustained period of lower short term market rates, the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities began to\nmove up sharply following the increase in short term market interest rates. This trend, which accelerated in the second half of 2022\nand in 2023, began to abate in 2024. The higher average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a higher average\nyield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the yield on loans and an increase in the interest on reserves held at\nthe FRBB. This resulted in a significantly lower net interest margin in the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $13.8 million to $96.5 million for the first six months of 2024, as compared to $82.7\nmillion for the first six months 2023, driven by the increase in average interest-earning assets discussed above. The yield on total\ninterest-earning assets was 4.50% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 4.06% for the same period in 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased by $13.6 million when comparing the two periods, primarily resulting from a 7% increase in\naverage loan balances, combined with a 41 basis point increase in yield. The increase in yield was driven primarily by a higher yield\non loans, reflecting both an increase in average loan rate - as the Bank continued to originate loans at higher rates and reprice existing\nloans, as well as higher loan fees.\nSecurities and short-term investments, which include the Bank’s cash holdings at the FRBB, accounted for 8% of the total average\ninterest-earning assets for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as the Bank\ncontinued to manage its balance sheet to reduce the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. This was partially offset by an\nincrease in the fair value of the Bank’s equity securities portfolio when compared to the prior year. Combined income for these\ncategories increased by $146,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to higher average yields, partially offset by a $48.1\nmillion decrease in combined average balances. The decrease in the Bank's cash held at the FRBB as a percentage of interest-earning\nassets was partially offset by a higher interest rate paid on excess reserves. Also, the dividend on the Bank’s stock investment at the\nFHLB increased during the period, driven by a larger average balance of FHLB stock and a higher dividend yield.\nThe average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.31% for the first six months of 2024 from 3.27% for the comparable\nperiod in 2023. Total interest expense increased by $22.3 million when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 due\nto higher interest rates on deposits and borrowings, combined with higher aggregate average balances.\nInterest expense on deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased by $12.7 million over the same period in 2023, due\nto a 133 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, partially offset by a decrease of $98.9 million in average interest-bearing\ndeposits. After a sustained period of historically low short term rates, beginning in early 2022 the Bank observed rising market\npricing for term deposits, money market accounts, and wholesale funds. This trend, which was sustained during 2022 and 2023,\nbegan to abate in the first quarter of 2024. The Bank continued to manage core product rates, implemented special offerings, and\ncontinued to use wholesale time deposits to remain competitive while balancing cost versus growth.\nInterest expense on borrowed funds for the first six months of 2024 increased by $9.6 million as compared to the same period in\n2023, primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, combined with a $327.7 million increase in average\nbalances. The increase in the FHLB borrowings rate was primarily driven by the higher short-term market rates, partially offset by the\nhigher average balance of lower rate FHLB HLB-Option advances in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same period in\n27\n2023. The FHLB provides an explanation of HLB-Option Advances on its website under the “Products' ' section that explains the\nfeatures of this product.\nThe following tables detail components of net interest income and yields/rates on daily average earning assets/liabilities.\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2024\nAVERAGE YIELD/ AVERAGE YIELD/\nBALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9) BALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9)\n(In Thousands)\nLoans (1) (2) $ 3,704,236 $ 74,222 4.01 % $ 3,968,123 $ 87,785 4.42 %\nSecurities (3) (4) 101,432 2,013 3.97 117,840 3,133 5.32\nFederal Reserve and other short-term investments 269,834 6,480 4.80 205,312 5,572 5.43\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,075,502 82,715 4.06 4,291,275 96,490 4.50\nOther assets 55,242 65,126\nTotal assets $ 4,130,744 $ 4,356,401\nInterest-bearing deposits (5) $ 2,223,225 30,608 2.75 $ 2,124,302 43,287 4.08\nBorrowed funds 1,126,459 24,166 4.29 1,454,181 33,751 4.64\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,349,684 54,774 3.27 3,578,483 77,038 4.31\nDemand deposits 374,656 346,399\nOther liabilities 10,551 14,882\nTotal liabilities 3,734,891 3,939,764\nStockholders’ equity 395,853 416,637\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,130,744 $ 4,356,401\nNet interest income $ 27,941 $ 19,452\nWeighted average spread 0.79 % 0.19 %\nNet interest margin (6) 1.37 % 0.91 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average\ninterest-bearing liabilities (7) 121.67 % 119.92 %\n(1) Before allowance for credit losses.\n(2) Includes average non-accrual loans.\n(3) Excludes the impact of the average net unrealized gain or loss on securities.\n(4) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n(5) Includes mortgagors' escrow accounts.\n(6) Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(7) Total interest-earning assets divided by total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8) Average balances are calculated on a daily basis.\n(9) Annualized.\nThe following table presents information regarding changes in interest and dividend income and interest expense of the Bank for\nthe periods indicated.

The Bank determined that a $545,000 adjustment to increase the allowance\nfor credit losses and no reserve for unfunded commitments was required upon adoption. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nAt June 30, 2024, management's review of the allowance for credit losses concluded that a balance of $26.9 million was adequate\nto provide for losses based upon evaluation of risk in the loan portfolio. During the first six months of 2024, management provided\n$288,000 to achieve such an allowance for credit loss balance at June 30, 2024. Comparably, for the six months ended June 30,2023,\nmanagement’s evaluation of the balance of the allowance for credit losses indicated the need for a provision of $606,000. Credit\nquality remained strong with no delinquent or non performing commercial real estate loans as of June 30, 2024. The Bank did not\nrecord any charge-offs in the first six months of 2024 or 2023.\nSee Notes 1 and 6 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and “Loans and Foreclosed Real Estate”\nincluded in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information pertaining to the allowance for credit losses.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of gain on equity securities, net, customer service fees on deposits, increases in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance policies and miscellaneous income. Total other income was $9.0 million for the first six months of\n2024, as compared to other income of $9.5 million for the same period in 2023. In the first six months of 2024, the Bank recorded\ngains totaling $8.4 million on equity securities, comprised solely of unrealized gains on equity securities held at the end of the period.\nIn the first six months of 2023, the Bank recorded gains totaling $8.9 million on equity securities, comprised solely of unrealized gains\non equity securities held at the end of the period\nCustomer service fees on deposits decreased marginally in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In\nrecent years, there has been a continuous decline in deposit account transaction fees, as the Bank has eliminated many fees on deposit\nproducts to simplify offerings and enhance the value proposition of our consumer and business checking accounts to customers.\nGenerally, the Bank’s strategy does not rely on generating substantial non-interest fee-based revenue from our deposit accounts.\nAn increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance also contributed to other income during the first six months\nof 2024 and 2023. The Bank held $13.8 million in life insurance policies at June 30, 2024 as compared to $13.5 million at June 30,\n2023. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. Income from these assets is fully\nexcludable from federal income taxes and contributed $163,000 to other income in the first six months of 2024, as compared to\n$166,000 for the same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, deposit insurance,\nmarketing, foreclosure and related, and other general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses were $14.5 million, or an\nannualized 0.67% of average total assets, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $14.3 million, or an annualized\n0.69% of average total assets, for the same period of 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses increased by $40,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to annual merit-based salary increases, enhancements to our operational teams and higher payroll taxes,\npartially offset by reductions in executive pay implemented during 2023. The number of employees increased, reflecting additional\nstaff in our SDG and operational teams, partially offset by a smaller branch staff.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses increased by $54,000, or 7%, in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher depreciation expenses, as the Bank made improvements to the corporate\noffices, which were completed in the second half of 2023. Lower rental income recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2024 also\ncontributed to the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The Bank owns rental apartments located above its Nantucket\nbranch which are rented during the summer season.\nData processing expenses for the first six months of 2024 increased by $94,000, or 7%, when compared to the same period in\n2023, driven primarily by higher data processing charges associated with improvements made to the Bank's systems and volume\nincreases in 2024. Technology spending at the Bank remains focused on three primary objectives: delivering new or improved\ncustomer experience, reducing costs through simplification and automation of internal processes, and securing customer and Bank\nconfidential information.\nDeposit insurance expense for the first six months of 2024 increased by $389,000 or 31%, when compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase was the result of a higher assessed rate, combined with a larger assessment base, driven by the Bank’s balance\nsheet growth. Deposit insurance expense consists of premiums paid to the FDIC and the DIF. The FDIC assessment rate is determined\nbased on several factors, including capitalization, asset growth, earnings, use of brokered deposits and level of non-performing assets,\namong others, and is calculated on an assessment base that takes into consideration the Bank’s average total assets and average\ntangible equity, among other factors. The DIF assessment rate is based on an institution’s risk category, which is defined based on\nsimilar factors. Effective the first quarterly assessment period of 2023, the FDIC implemented a system-wide increase that applied to\nall banks, which increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate by 2 basis points. This is part of a long-planned effort by\nthe FDIC to return the funded status of the FDIC insurance fund to a higher level. The Bank carefully manages its balance sheet to\n29\ncontrol the deposit insurance expense associated with excess liquidity while optimizing its funding mix.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $213,000, or 44%, for the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as\nthe Bank continues to carefully manage these expenses focusing on business development for the Bank’s Commercial Real Estate\nGroup and SDG. The Bank continued to shift its marketing spending during the first six months of 2024 towards supporting its\ncommercial deposit acquisition activities in the WMA and the SFBA.\nForeclosure and related expenses include expenses associated with the collection and foreclosure process, such as legal, tax,\nappraisal, insurance and other related foreclosure expenses. These expenses may be recovered when the loan returns to performing\nstatus or when the Bank exercises its remedies, as they are generally secured by the Bank’s mortgages. Such recoveries, if any, are\nreflected in future periods as contra-expense. The Bank recorded $46,000 in foreclosure and related expenses in the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 as compared to a $48,000 credit in the same period in 2023. The credit in the prior year was attributed to the recovery\nof expenses in connection with the resolution of certain non-performing loans recorded in the first six months of 2023, including an\n$85,000 gain on disposal recorded on the sale of a foreclosed property. At June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the\nBank did not own any foreclosed property.\nOther general and administrative expenses, which include director fees, supplies, deposit related losses and audit-related\nexpenses, among others, decreased by $243,000, or 12%, when comparing the two periods, reflecting lower supplies, loan-related,\ntravel and legal expenses, partially offset by higher audit-related expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Bank recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established\nfor the temporary difference between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. The Bank's deferred tax asset\nis reviewed quarterly by management as to the realizability of such asset.\nDuring the first six months of 2024, the Bank recorded $2.6 million, or 19.5% of pre-tax income, in tax expense as compared to\n$5.8 million, or 25.6%, for the same quarter in 2023. The lower effective tax rate was the result of $465,000 of stock options excess\ntax benefit and the revision of income tax estimates recorded in the first six months of 2024, partially offset by lower unrealized gains\non equity securities recognized during the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, as these securities\nare held at a tax-advantaged subsidiary. The Bank recognized $102,000 on the exercise of stock options during the first six months of\n2023.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nCOMPARISON AT JUNE 30, 2024 TO DECEMBER 31, 2023\nAssets totaled $4.521 billion at June 30, 2024, as compared to $4.484 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $36.8 million,\nor 2% annualized. During the first six months of 2024, the Bank continued to manage the balance of excess reserves held at the\nFRBB, in order to minimize the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity.\nSecurities, Short-term Investments and FHLB Stock\nSecurities were $99.1 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $15.8 million when compared to $83.3 million at December 31,\n2023, reflecting an increase in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio and a $3.0 million increase in debt securities held to\nmaturity. The fair value of equity securities fluctuates with the performance of equity markets.\nAt both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank held a $3.5 million investment in the subordinated debt issued by a bank\nholding company in which the Bank also maintains an equity investment. The balance at June 30, 2024 included additional\ninvestments made in the senior notes and subordinated debt of other financial institutions. These investments are included in\nsecurities held to maturity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent permissible under Massachusetts law, the Bank holds\nthese securities at the Bank or in a tax-advantaged subsidiary in order to reduce taxable income.\nAt June 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for approximately 93% of the investment portfolio. At June 30, 2024, the Bank\nheld a $8.7 million investment in the CRA Fund, a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify under the CRA securities\ntest. Additionally, the portfolio included $83.9 million in marketable common equity securities. The Bank’s marketable common\nequity securities are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior returns on capital over a longer time\nhorizon. The Bank’s process is focused on identifying businesses with strong returns on capital, owner-oriented management teams,\ngood reinvestment opportunities or capital discipline, and reasonable valuations. The portfolio is concentrated in a relatively small\nnumber of investments in the financial services and technology areas. The Bank receives two sources of advantageous tax treatment\nthrough these investments. First, dividend distributions from these companies to the Bank are partially excluded from the Bank’s\ntaxable income due to the Dividends Received Deduction. Second, to the extent that these companies are capable of internal\nreinvestment at high rates of return or deploy capital via tax-advantaged repurchases, the deferred tax liability associated with any\nlong-term unrealized gains on our investments constitutes an interest-free source of financing.\nAs a member of the FHLB of Boston, the Bank is required to hold a Membership Stock Investment plus an Activity-based Stock\nInvestment in the FHLB, which is based primarily on the amount of FHLB borrowings. The Bank recorded dividends on FHLB stock\ntotaling $1.3 million and $2.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $878,000 and $1.6 million for\n30\nthe same periods in 2023. The increase reflected the dividend rate increase implemented by the FHLB, as well as a higher average\nbalance of FHLB stock. At June 30, 2024, the Bank held $66.2 million in FHLB stock compared to $69.6 million at December 31,\n2023.\nLoans and Foreclosed Real Estate\nDuring the first six months of 2024, net loans outstanding increased by $19.2 million to $3.933 billion, from $3.914 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, attributable primarily to originated loans of $131.4 million, partially offset by payoffs and amortization.\nComparably, loan originations for the same period in 2023 were $203.2 million. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net\nloans outstanding represented 87% of assets. Mortgage loans continue to account for more than 99% of the loan portfolio.\nA breakdown of the originated loan by geography follows:\nSix Months Ended June Six Months Ended\n30, 2023 June 30, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMassachusetts $ 104,181 51 % $ 93,048 71 %\nWashington Metropolitan Area 94,094 46 38,328 29\nSan Francisco Bay Area 4,900 3 — —\nTotal $ 203,175 100 % $ 131,376 100 %\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had $1.216 billion and $117.7 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loans originated in the\nWMA and the SFBA outstanding (including construction loans). At December 31, 2023, the Bank had $1.199 billion and $118.5\nmillion, respectively, of loans originated in the WMA and the SFBA outstanding.\nWMA: The Bank began lending to commercial real estate borrowers in the WMA in November 2016, after several years of\nresearch and preparation. The Bank had also held direct equity investments in other WMA area banks prior to entering the market\noperationally. In 2019, the Bank opened a commercial lending office at a temporary location and hired a commercial real estate\nlender. In February 2020, the Bank acquired a property in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., renovated the property,\nand opened a commercial banking office in 2022. The Bank obtained regulatory approval to exercise branch powers at this office in\n2023. The Bank has a senior commercial real estate lender based in the WMA, along with a relationship manager from the Bank’s\nSDG. When needed, the Bank also utilizes Boston-based staff in its Commercial Real Estate Group and SDG with experience in the\nWMA, on a fly-away basis from its main office.\nThe Bank originally identified the WMA as an attractive opportunity for three reasons. First, the region has favorable economic\ncharacteristics that will support long-term investments in commercial real estate. It is the capital of the world’s largest economy, it is\nan international economic gateway, it has one of the highest household median income of any of the nation’s major metropolitan areas,\nand it has a relatively high concentration of young people. Second, the commercial real estate product in the market bears significant\nsimilarity to Boston, characterized by high density, urban infill development, transit-oriented multifamily, and scarcity imposed by\nland supply and restrictions on vertical development. Third, we believe that the banking market in Washington, D.C. has experienced\na level of consolidation and disruption that has left smaller and mid-sized real estate investors underserved as compared to the Boston\nmarket. Although we are relatively new to this marketplace, we believe that our history as one of America’s oldest banks and our\nfamily management team provide stability and surety of execution that is valued by our customers. With over five years of operation\nin the market, we have gained increasing confidence in this thesis. We view this as an attractive opportunity for internal capital\nallocation and superior to geographically proximate, product-adjacent businesses like wealth management, insurance, or\ncommercial-industrial lending in our home marketplace. The Bank did not initially make commercial construction loans in this\nmarket, as these loans have a higher level of inherent risk. As the Bank developed greater familiarity with the market and the portfolio\ngrew, the Bank made the investment in the operational capacity to originate and manage such loans in the WMA and the Bank now\noriginates the full range of commercial mortgages in Washington. For similar reasons, the Bank also delayed originating residential\nowner occupant loans in the WMA, but as the Bank’s customer base has grown, the Bank has seen significant demand for this service.\nIn 2023, the Bank began offering such loans to existing commercial and private clients of the Bank in the WMA.\nSFBA: The San Francisco Bay Area is the Bank’s newest and smallest market, having begun operations in 2021 with a focus on\ncommercial real estate customers and commercial and nonprofit deposit relationships. The Bank relies to a large extent on Boston and\nWMA-based staff to cover the initial operations in this market. The Bank recently hired a deposit-focused relationship manager in\nSan Francisco to join the SDG and is actively looking to hire a dedicated commercial real estate lender in this market. The Bank does\nnot have a retail branch in this market. The Bank built the operational framework for originating commercial real estate loans in the\nSFBA and began engaging with prospective customers in 2021. The Bank closed its first loan in the SFBA in the fourth quarter of\n2021 and continued to originate loans in 2022, and to a lesser extent, in 2023. The Bank did not originate loans in the SFBA in the\nfirst six months of 2024.\nThis initiative builds on several years of research and direct equity investments that provided the Bank with exposure and insight\ninto the SFBA real estate and banking markets, but the Bank’s long-term plans were accelerated to capitalize the pandemic-related\n31\ndisruption in those markets. The Bank continues to believe that the most attractive markets for its business are coastal, urban, gateway\ncities with substantial wealth, favorable demographics, substantial multifamily real estate, and consolidation among small and\nmid-sized banks. This initiative has initially focused on both investor and owner-occupied commercial real estate and multifamily\nproperties. The Bank does not yet originate commercial construction or owner-occupied residential loans in the SFBA.\nOriginations in the SFBA have been materially lower recently when compared to the WMA and Boston markets. This is largely\nthe product of the changes in market conditions in 2023 and 2024 in the SFBA market, as opposed to a deliberate choice by the Bank\nto alter its approach to the marketplace. There were some SFBA market-specific conditions in 2023, including disruption in the local\nbanking market and several well-publicized portfolios of distressed multifamily properties, that appear to have had a differential\nimpact on the SFBA multifamily market. The Bank continues to engage actively with prospective customers in the SFBA for both\nlending and deposit opportunities.\nAll WMA and SFBA underwriting and approval processes are identical to those utilized in the Boston marketplace and all loans\nare reviewed and approved by the Bank’s Executive Committee and when larger than $2.0 million, by the Bank’s full Board of\nDirectors. A member of the Executive Committee performs a site visit for every collateral property. The Bank has retained local\ncounsel in both markets to advise on all of its transactional needs, with oversight on each individual transaction by the Bank’s primary\nreal estate counsel in Boston. The Bank uses the same consulting firm in Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco for\nenvironmental assessments and property condition reports to ensure quality of execution and manage risk. This firm also performs\nseismic risk assessments in San Francisco for the Bank. The Bank generally requires that all third-party assessments are conducted by\nthe Bank’s consultants and will not generally accept reports ordered separately by a borrower. Once closed, these loans are subject to\nall of the Bank’s regular quality control and portfolio management processes.\nThe Bank approaches prospective borrowers directly via advertising programs, and indirectly via intermediaries such as attorneys,\naccountants and mortgage brokers. The Bank also has existing Boston-based customers with real estate investment holdings in both\nthe Massachusetts and the WMA or SFBA markets.\nCommercial real estate loans by collateral type at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024 , are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 June 30, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMultifamily (5+) $ 1,077,174 34 % $ 1,131,831 35 %\nResidential (1-4) 481,014 15 485,403 15\nOffice 508,397 16 477,185 15\nMixed use 524,657 17 545,002 17\nRetail 300,429 10 302,244 10\nIndustrial 133,863 4 132,964 4\nLand 59,508 2 59,504 2\nOthers 70,242 2 71,240 2\nTotal $ 3,155,284 100 % $ 3,205,373 100 %\nMixed-use properties generally consist of urban properties which combine a substantial multifamily use with street level retail or\noffice uses.\nLoans are carried net of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is maintained at a level to absorb losses within the loan\nportfolio. At June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses had a balance of $26.9 million, as compared to $26.7 million at December\n31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.68% of gross loans as of both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Bank’s non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and foreclosed real estate. At June 30, 2024, there were eight\nresidential loans classified as non-accrual totaling $1.7 million as compared to five non-accrual loans totaling $1.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, non-performing assets were 0.04% of total assets, as compared to 0.03% at December 31,\n2023. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no foreclosed assets. The Bank works closely with delinquent\nmortgagors to bring their loans current and commences foreclosure proceedings if the mortgagor is unable to satisfy their outstanding\nobligation. Although regulatory changes have slowed the foreclosure process in recent years, the Bank continues to pursue\ndelinquencies vigorously.\nManagement believes that its loans classified as non-accrual are significantly collateralized, pose minimal risk of loss to the Bank,\nand the allowance for credit losses allocated to these loans is sufficient to absorb such losses, if any. However, management continues\nto monitor the loan portfolio and additional reserves will be recorded if necessary.\n32\nBelow is a summary of non-performing assets:\nDecember 31, June 30,\n2023 2024\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-accrual loans:\nResidential real estate $ 877 $ 1,109\nCommercial real estate — —\nHome equity 602 600\nTotal non-accrual loans 1,479 1,709\nForeclosed real estate — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 1,479 $ 1,709\nPercent of non-accrual loans to:\nTotal loans 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nPercent of non-performing assets to:\nTotal loans and foreclosed real estate 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 0.68 % 0.68 %\nOther Assets\nThe Bank held $13.8 million in bank-owned life insurance at June 30, 2024, as compared to $13.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe $163,000 increase during the first six months of 2024 is due to increases in the cash surrender value of policies insuring the life of\na current Bank executive. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. The Bank monitors\nthe financial strength and counterparty credit ratings of the policy issuers and has determined that at June 30, 2024, one of three\nissuers was rated at or above Bank guidelines. Of the other two issuers, one retained a rating from A.M. Best two notches below Bank\nguidelines at B++ , while the other retained a rating from Moody’s and Fitch two and one notches below Bank guidelines at Baa1 and\nA-, respectively (with a stable outlook).\nAs of June 30, 2024, the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability related to operating leases for two of the Bank’s\nbanking offices was $265,000 and $287,000, respectively. The right-of-use asset is included in other assets and the lease liability is\nincluded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Bank holds a $2.4 million investment in the common stock of Founders Bank, a de novo bank in\nWashington, D.C. This balance includes a $2.3 million initial investment in common stock and related unrealized gains.\nAs of June 30, 2024, other assets included a $741,000 investment in the Washington Housing Initiative, a CRA investment\nvehicle that provides low cost loans to acquire and develop affordable workforce housing in Washington D.C. and a $5.0 million\ninvestment in the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, a CRA investment vehicle that provides low cost loans to acquire and\ndevelop affordable workforce housing in San Francisco.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased by $68.3 million to $2.418 billion at June 30, 2024, from $2.350 billion at December 31, 2023.\nNon-certificate accounts, which include regular, money market, NOW and demand deposits, increased by $33.5 million from\nDecember 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024, while certificate balances increased by $34.8 million. The increase in non-certificate accounts\nwas driven by money market, NOW and demand deposit accounts, as the Bank continued to focus on developing and deepening\ndeposit relationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit customers. The increase in certificate account balances\nprimarily reflects a $25.9 million increase in retail and commercial time deposits, combined with a $8.9 million increase in wholesale\ntime deposits, which includes both brokered and Internet listing services time deposits. Non-certificate accounts represent 49.3% of\ntotal deposits at June 30, 2024, as compared to 49.0% at December 31, 2023.\nOther banks and credit unions in the Bank's market areas, banking services through the Internet, and mutual funds make up the\nBank’s primary competition for deposits. At times, the Bank also faces direct and indirect competition from fixed income securities\nsuch as U.S Treasury bills or non-bank financial services companies with access to the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. The Bank's ability to attract and retain deposits depends upon satisfaction of depositors' requirements with\nrespect to insurance, product, rate and service. The Bank offers traditional deposit products, competitive rates, convenient branch\nlocations, ATMs, debit cards and Internet-based banking for consumers and commercial account holders. The Bank also opens deposit\naccounts, including checking accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, directly online for personal customers.\nOccasionally, the Bank implements special offerings based on market conditions and the competitive environment. The Bank also\noffers a limited range of certificate of deposit products using national Internet listing services and brokered deposits. These\n33\nalternatives, at times, provide the Bank with a source of funding across different maturities at lower cost and/or longer duration than\nmay be available via retail or other wholesale channels. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had $497.6 million in deposits from these sources,\nas compared to $488.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank carefully manages its wholesale funding mix allocation based on\nmarket conditions to reduce the Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities and minimize the negative effect of elevated short-term rates\non the Bank’s net interest margin. In doing this, the Bank takes into consideration each funding source’s interest rate, broker\ncommission and FDIC insurance assessment implications (as applicable), speed of execution as well as the operational characteristics.\nThis approach has allowed the Bank to maintain deposit balances to fund lending activity and operate with an elevated level of on and\noff-balance sheet liquidity.\nDeposits are insured in full through the combination of the FDIC and the DIF. Generally, separately insured deposit accounts are\ninsured up to $250,000 by the FDIC and deposit balances in excess of this amount are insured by the DIF. DIF insurance provides an\nadvantage for the Bank as some competitors cannot offer this coverage.\nBelow is a summary of deposits:\nDeposit Balances by Type\nDecember 31, % of June 30, % of\n2023 Total 2024 Total\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-certificate accounts\nRegular $ 82,050 3.5 % $ 76,207 3.2 %\nMoney market deposits 723,786 30.8 754,573 31.2\nNOW 11,425 0.5 15,809 0.7\nDemand 339,059 14.4 343,262 14.2\nTotal non-certificate accounts 1,156,320 49.2 1,189,851 49.3\nTerm certificates of less than $250,000 836,382 35.6 839,840 34.6\nTerm certificates of $250,000 or more 357,275 15.2 388,573 16.1\nTotal certificate accounts 1,193,657 50.8 1,228,413 50.7\nTotal deposits $ 2,349,977 100.0 % $ 2,418,264 100.0 %\nBorrowings\nFHLB advances were $1.649 billion, or 36% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.693 billion, or 38% of total\nassets, at December 31, 2023. The Bank continued to manage its wholesale funding mix opportunistically during the first six months\nof 2024. During this period, borrowings decreased by $44.0 million, as the Bank experienced growth in retail and commercial\ndeposits. In late 2023 and 2024, the Bank began to gradually extend the duration of its FHLB Classic Advances to capture the benefit\nof the FHLB curve inversion and, to a lesser extent, protect against unexpected increases or a slower pace of decline in short-term\nmarket rates. Additionally, at June 30, 2024, the Bank had $785.0 million in FHLB HLB-Option Advances outstanding. These are\n3-year, 4-year, 5-year, and to a lesser extent 6-year and 7-year maturity fixed rate advances callable quarterly by the FHLB after an\ninitial lockout period of three months, which provide the Bank with a lower fixed rate in exchange for the call option granted to the\nFHLB. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had $30.0 million, $335.0 million, $375.0 million and $45.0 million in HLB-Option Advances\noutstanding, with original maturities in 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030, respectively, all of which were past their lockout periods and were\ncallable by the FHLB in the third quarter of 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to ensure the Bank has sufficient liquidity to fund its lending operations, off-balance sheet commitments and contractual\nobligations, the Bank maintains an adequate level of readily available liquidity, both on and off-balance sheet.\nThe Bank also assesses its liquidity position regularly by forecasting incoming and outgoing cash flows. In some cases,\ncontractual maturity dates are used to anticipate cash flows. However, when an asset or liability has no contractual maturity, or is\nsubject to early repayment or redemption at the discretion of the issuer or customer, cash flows can be difficult to predict. Generally,\nthese rights are exercised when it is most financially favorable to the issuer or customer.\nMarketable common equity holdings, although liquid, are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior\nreturns on capital over a longer time horizon.\nInvestment in FHLB stock is illiquid.\nResidential loans are susceptible to principal repayment at the discretion of the borrower. Commercial mortgage loans, while\nsubject to significant penalties for early repayment in most cases, can also prepay at the borrower’s discretion. In the first six months\nof 2024, prepayment rates were significantly stable when compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe Bank invests in key executive life insurance policies that are illiquid during the life of the executive. Such policies totaled\n$13.8 million, or less than 1% of total assets, at June 30, 2024.\nNon-certificate deposit balances can generally be withdrawn from the Bank at any time. The Bank estimates the volatility of its\ndeposits in light of the general economic climate and recent actual experience. Over the past 10 years, deposits have exceeded\n34\nwithdrawals resulting in net cash inflows from depositors.\nTime certificates of deposit, which have predefined maturity dates, have different redemption characteristics based on their nature.\nRetail certificates of deposit, subject to early redemption penalties, can be withdrawn subject to the discretion of the Bank. Internet\nlisting service certificates are offered on the same terms as retail certificates, although the Bank generally does not permit early\nwithdrawal. Brokered certificates generally may not be withdrawn before the stated maturity. The Bank had $1.228 billion in time\ndeposits outstanding at June 30, 2024, of which $1.201 billion have a contractual maturity within one year.\nAt June 30, 2024, $863.7 million of the Bank’s borrowings were fixed in terms of maturity and $785.0 million can be called\nquarterly by the FHLB during the third quarter of 2024. The Bank had no amortizing advances as of June 30, 2024.\nThe Bank also monitors its off-balance sheet items. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $285.7 million in\ncommitments to extend credit, as compared to $357.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has commitments for data\nprocessing agreements totaling $7.4 million at June 30, 2024.\nThe Bank takes each of these preceding issues into consideration when measuring its liquidity position. Specific measurements\ninclude the Bank’s cash flow position from the 30-day to 365-day horizon, the level of price-sensitive liabilities to earning assets and\nloan to deposit ratios. Additionally, the Bank “shocks” its cash flows by assuming significant cash outflows in both non-certificate\nand certificate deposit balances. At June 30, 2024, each measurement was within predefined Bank guidelines, with the exception of\nthe loan to deposit ratio and the dependency ratio, which were above the guidelines. The loan to deposit ratio has increased in recent\nyears driven primarily by the significant growth in the loan portfolio in 2022, and to a lesser extent in 2023, and the modest deposit\ngrowth by comparison. This ratio has also been impacted by the Bank’s allocation of the wholesale funding mix between wholesale\ndeposits and borrowings - particularly by management’s deliberate efforts to replace maturing Internet listing services time deposits\nwith lower rate FHLB advances. The dependency ratio is an internal Bank defined measure of the share of longer term assets funded\nwith potentially price-sensitive liabilities and, at June 30, 2024, was above the Bank’s guideline driven by the same factors described\nabove. The Bank’s calculation of the dependency ratio generally treats some portion of certificates of deposit as being potentially price\nsensitive, whereas it does not treat money market funds in the same way. Consequently, the migration of deposits from money market\naccounts to certificates of deposit has also contributed to an increase in the dependency ratio. The Bank continues to carefully manage\nloan growth and focusing on gathering retail and commercial deposits, while maintaining significant on and off-balance sheet\nliquidity.\nThe Bank’s initial source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents which were $369.1 million, or 8% of total assets, at June 30,\n2024. Virtually all cash and cash equivalents are held in overnight cash balances at the FRBB, which are immediately accessible for\nliquidity. The Bank carefully monitors these overnight cash balances to minimize the carrying cost of on-balance sheet liquidity.\nTo supplement its liquidity position, should the need arise, the Bank maintains its membership in the FHLB where it is eligible to\nobtain both short and long-term credit advances and is eligible to access the FRBB discount window. The FHLB does not accept\ncertain types of real estate loans and establishes certain limits on borrowing activity, including a limitation on commercial real estate\ncollateral discounted value up to two times the Bank’s GAAP shareholders’ equity and an overall limit of total extension of credit up\nto 40% of the Bank’s total assets. This latter limit was lowered from 50% by the FHLB and became applicable to all member banks in\n2024. This dual relationship with the FHLB and FRBB provides the Bank with the flexibility to maximize available capacity and to\naccess immediately available liquidity using the FRBB discount window if the FHLB was unavailable to provide liquidity or were to\nestablish more stringent limits in the future. The Bank actively pledges new collateral as loans are originated and manages the\ncollateral allocation between the FHLB and the FRBB to maximize borrowing capacity. In aggregate, the Bank had available\nborrowing capacity of $725.9 million from these sources at June 30, 2024, as compared to $598.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to approximately $1.818 billion from the FHLB to meet its borrowing needs, based\non the Bank's available qualified collateral which consists primarily of one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, certain\nmultifamily residential property and commercial mortgage loans. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had $1.649 billion in advances\noutstanding from the FHLB and had $164.5 million in available unused capacity (net of accrued interest on outstanding advances).\nThis compares to an unused capacity of $355.1 million at December 31, 2023. The FHLB unused capacity decreased in the first six\nmonths of 2024 as a result of a decrease of $235.1 million in gross FHLB capacity during this period, partially offset by a $44.0\nmillion decrease in outstanding advances. The decline in gross FHLB capacity was primarily a result of the adoption of the 40% cap\ndiscussed above, which resulted in the Bank transferring collateral to the FRBB in the first six months of 2024.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to $561.4 million by accessing the FRBB Discount Window, based on the Bank's\navailable qualified collateral which consists primarily of HELOCs, one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, multifamily\nresidential property and commercial mortgages.and construction loans. The Bank initially obtained approval to pledge HELOCs, and\nin 2023, obtained approval and began pledging commercial and residential real estate loans. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank\nobtained approval to pledge additional loans to the FRBB in anticipation of the FHLB 40% cap adoption, and transferred collateral\nfrom the FHLB to the FRBB. At June 30, 2024 the Bank did not have any advances outstanding at the FRBB and had $561.4 million\nin available unused capacity.\nThe Bank obtains the necessary capital to support its current and future requirements from the retained earnings generated though\nits operations.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Bank had capital of $417.2 million, or 9.2% of total assets, as compared to $407.6 million, or 9.1% of total\n35\nassets, at December 31, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, stockholders' equity increased by $9.6 million due\nprimarily to net income for the period of $11.0 million partially offset by the declaration of dividends of $1.26 per share, which\nreduced capital by $2.7 million.\nThe Bank is subject to minimum capital maintenance requirements. Regulatory guidelines define the minimum amount of\nqualifying capital an institution must maintain as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and average total assets. The Bank's ratios\nexceeded these regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following table details the Bank’s actual capital ratios and minimum regulatory ratios as of December 31, 2023 and June 30,\n2024.\nMinimum Minimum To Be Well\nCapital Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Requirement* Corrective Actions Provisions\nAmounts Ratio Amounts Ratio Amounts Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 434,272 13.17 % $ 346,214 10.50 % $ 329,728 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 407,620 12.36 230,810 7.00 214,323 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 407,620 12.36 280,269 8.50 263,782 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 407,620 9.52 171,297 4.00 214,121 5.00\nJune 30, 2024\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 444,118 13.58 % $ 343,514 10.50 % $ 327,156 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 417,178 12.75 229,009 7.00 212,651 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 417,178 12.75 278,082 8.50 261,725 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 417,178 9.55 174,727 4.00 218,409 5.00\n* Minimum risk-based regulatory capital ratios and amounts at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024 include the applicable minimum\nrisk-based capital ratios and capital conservation buffer of 2.5%\n36\nItem 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe earnings of most banking institutions are exposed to interest rate risk because their balance sheets, both assets and liabilities,\nare predominantly interest-bearing. It is the Bank's objective to maximize the Bank’s net interest income through the cycle while\nminimizing, to the degree prudently possible, its exposure to interest rate risk, bearing in mind that the Bank, by its very nature, will\nalways be in the business of taking on interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Asset Liability\nCommittee (the “ALCO”) and Board of Directors of the Bank. The ALCO is composed of members of Bank Management and the\nExecutive Committee of the Board. The ALCO establishes and monitors the various components of the balance sheet including\nvolume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets along with funding sources. The goal is to balance liquidity, interest rate risk and\nprofitability. The primary tool used in managing interest rate risk is income simulation modeling. Income simulation modeling\nmeasures changes in net interest income by projecting the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet and applying different\ninterest rate scenarios. Management incorporates numerous assumptions into the simulation model, such as asset prepayment speeds,\nbalance sheet growth and non-maturity deposits elasticity. Management believes that there have been no material changes in the\ninterest rate risk reported in the Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The information is contained in the Form 10-K within the section “Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nItem 4 – Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Bank’s management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness, as of June 30, 2024, of the Bank’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable\nassurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npossible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, the\nCEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable\nassurance level.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control\nThere were no significant changes in the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e), during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nBank’s internal control over financial reporting.\n37\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 – Legal Proceedings\nThe Bank is involved, from time to time, as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business and\ntypically related to loan collection activities. As of June 30, 2024, the Bank was not involved in any material legal proceedings the\noutcome of which, if determined in a manner adverse to the Bank, would have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nThere have generally been no material changes to the nature of the risk factors previously disclosed in the Bank’s most recent Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the FDIC.\nItem 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3 – Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4 – Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5 – Other Information\nNone.\nItem 6 – Exhibits\nExhibit No.\n31.1 Certifications – Chief Executive Officer\n31.2 Certifications – Chief Financial Officer\n32.1 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Executive Officer\n32.2 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Financial Officer\n38\nsignatures\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS\nDate: August 7, 2024 /s/\nRobert H.

Gaughen, President and Chief Operating Officer (781) 783-1761\nHINGHAM REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS (NASDAQ: HIFS), Hingham, Massachusetts\nannounced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nEarnings\nNet income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $5,846,000 or $2.68 per share basic and\n$2.66 per share diluted, as compared to $3,297,000 or $1.53 per share basic and $1.50 per share\ndiluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the third\nquarter of 2024 was 5.52%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.54%, as compared to\n3.25% and 0.31% for the same period last year. Net income per share (diluted) for the third quarter\nof 2024 increased by 77% compared to the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which represents net income excluding\nthe after-tax gain on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on the\ndisposal of fixed assets, was $3,163,000 or $1.45 per share basic and $1.44 per share diluted, as\ncompared to $2,895,000 or $1.35 per share basic and $1.32 per share diluted for the same period last\nyear. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.99%\nand the annualized core return on average assets was 0.29%, as compared to 2.85% and 0.27% for the\nsame period last year. Core net income per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2024 increased by\n9% over the same period in 2023.\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16,816,000 or $7.73 per share basic\nand $7.67 per share diluted, as compared to $20,056,000 or $9.33 per share basic and $9.14 per share\ndiluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the first\nnine months of 2024 was 5.35%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.52%, as\ncompared to 6.70% and 0.64% for the same period in 2023. Net income per share (diluted) for the\nfirst nine months of 2024 decreased by 16% over the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents net income\nexcluding the after-tax gain on securities, both realized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on the\ndisposal of fixed assets, was $7,558,000 or $3.47 per share basic and $3.45 per share diluted, as\ncompared to $12,686,000 or $5.90 per share basic and $5.78 per share diluted for the same period last\nPage 1 of 10\nyear. The Bank’s annualized core return on average equity for the first nine months of 2024 was\n2.41%, and the annualized core return on average assets was 0.23%, as compared to 4.24% and\n0.41% for the same period in 2023. Core net income per share (diluted) for the first nine months of\n2024 decreased by 40% over the same period in 2023.\nSee Page 10 for a reconciliation between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) net\nincome and non-GAAP core net income. GAAP requires that gains and losses on equity securities,\nnet of tax, realized and unrealized, be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In\ncalculating core net income, the Bank did not make any adjustments other than those relating to\nafter-tax gain on equity securities, realized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on disposal of fixed\nassets.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets were $4.450 billion at September 30, 2024, representing a 1% annualized decline\nyear-to-date and 2% growth from September 30, 2023.\nNet loans were $3.863 billion at September 30, 2024, representing a 2% annualized decline\nyear-to-date and 1% growth from September 30, 2023. Origination activity was concentrated in the\nBoston and Washington D.C. markets and remained focused on stabilized multifamily commercial\nreal estate and multifamily construction. The Bank continues to evaluate new opportunities in the\nSan Francisco market, where interest in acquisitions and refinancing activity from the Bank’s\ncustomers began to pick up in 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the Bank continued to experience\nloan prepayments more consistent with historic trends, including continued significant turnover in the\nBank’s construction portfolio. As noted below, asset quality remained strong and finding high-quality\nloan assets remains a core business objective of the Bank.\nRetail and business deposits were $1.977 billion at September 30, 2024, representing 8% annualized\ngrowth year-to-date and 3% growth from September 30, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits,\nincluded in retail and business deposits, were $358.0 million at September 30, 2024, representing 7%\nannualized growth year-to-date and stable from September 30, 2023.\nGrowth in non-interest bearing and money market balances in the first nine months of 2024 reflected\nthe Bank’s focus on developing and deepening deposit relationships with new and existing\ncommercial and non-profit customers. Investments in new relationship managers over the last nine\nmonths continued to contribute to deposit growth in the third quarter of 2024. The Bank continues to\nrecruit actively for talented commercial bankers in Boston, Washington, and San Francisco,\nparticularly as respected competitors have exited these markets or merged with larger regional banks.\nThe stability of the Bank’s balance sheet, as well as full and unlimited deposit insurance through the\nBank’s participation in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund, continues to be appealing to\ncustomers in times of uncertainty.\nWholesale funds, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, brokered deposits, and\nInternet listing service deposits were $2.015 billion at September 30, 2024, representing a 10%\nannualized decline year-to-date and 1% growth from September 30, 2023. In the first nine months of\n2024, the Bank continued to manage its wholesale funding mix to optimize the cost of funds while\ntaking advantage of the inverted yield curve by adding lower rate longer term liabilities. Wholesale\ndeposits, which include brokered and Internet listing service time deposits, were $482.2 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, representing a 1% annualized decline year-to-date and a 2% decline from\nSeptember 30, 2023. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $1.531 billion at\nPage 2 of 10\nSeptember 30, 2024, representing a 13% annualized decline from December 31, 2023, and 1%\ngrowth from September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank maintained an additional\n$815.5 million in immediately available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of\nBoston and the Federal Reserve Bank, in addition to $368.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nBook value per share was $193.42 as of September 30, 2024, representing 3% annualized growth\nyear-to-date and 4% growth from September 30, 2023. This growth is not consistent with the Bank’s\nlong-term objectives. In addition to the increase in book value per share, the Bank declared $2.52 in\ndividends per share since September 30, 2023.\nOn September 25, 2024, the Bank declared a regular cash dividend of $0.63 per share. This dividend\nwill be paid on November 13, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. This was the\nBank’s 123rd consecutive quarterly dividend.\nThe Bank has also generally declared special cash dividends in each of the last twenty-nine years,\ntypically in the fourth quarter, but did not declare a special dividend in 2023. The Bank sets the level\nof the special dividend based on the Bank’s capital requirements and the prospective return on other\ncapital allocation options, particularly the incremental return on capital from new loan originations.\nThis may result in special dividends, if any, significantly above or below the regular quarterly\ndividend. Future regular and special dividends will be considered by the Board of Directors on a\nquarterly basis.\nOperational Performance Metrics\nThe net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 11 basis points to 1.07%,\nas compared to 0.96% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This was the second consecutive quarter\nof continued expansion. This improvement was the result of an increase in the yield on earning\nassets combined with a decline in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The six basis points increase\nin the yield on earning assets was driven primarily by a higher yield on loans, as the Bank continued\nto originate loans at higher rates and reprice existing loans. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities fell\nthree basis points, as the Bank began to reduce rates later in the third quarter and continued to take\nadvantage of the inverted yield curve by adding lower rate FHLB advances and brokered deposits.\nThe net interest margin in the final month of the third quarter of 2024 was 1.14% annualized.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the third quarter of 2024. At September 30,\n2024, non-performing assets totaled 0.04% of total assets, compared to 0.03% at December 31, 2023\nand 0.00% at September 30, 2023. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio\ntotaled 0.04% at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as compared to 0.01% at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Bank did not record any charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 or\n2023. All non-performing assets and loans cited above were and are residential, owner-occupant\nloans.\nThe Bank did not have any delinquent or non-performing commercial real estate loans as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, or September 30, 2023. The Bank did not own any\nforeclosed property as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, as defined on page 5 below, fell to 62.19% for the third quarter of 2024, as\ncompared to 68.57% in the prior quarter and 62.55% for the same period last year. Operating\nexpenses as a percentage of average assets rose to 0.68% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to\n0.67% for the prior quarter and the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be significantly\ninfluenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank utilizes these paired figures together to assess\nPage 3 of 10\nits operational efficiency over time. During periods of significant net interest income volatility, the\nefficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational efficiency of the Bank.\nThe Bank remains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of continuous\nimprovement and standard work that supports operational leverage, positioning the Bank to operate\nmore efficiently in future.\nChairman Robert H. Gaughen Jr. stated, “Returns on equity and assets in the third quarter of 2024\nwere significantly lower than our long-term performance, reflecting the challenge from the increase\nin short-term interest rates over the last twenty-four months and a historically long and deep inversion\nof the yield curve. These conditions have posed a significant - albeit ultimately temporary -\nchallenge to our business model. Our core business has been particularly challenged during this\nperiod and our investment operations have been critical to sustaining some growth in book value per\nshare in this environment. As our assets continue to reprice higher and our liabilities, including both\ndeposits and wholesale funding, reprice lower, conditions have become somewhat more favorable for\nour model.\nWhile this market environment has been extraordinarily challenging, the Bank’s business model has\nbeen built over time to compound shareholder capital through economic cycles. During all such\nperiods, we remain focused on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting and disciplined cost\ncontrol - the building blocks for compounding shareholder capital through all stages of the economic\ncycle. These remain constant, regardless of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. I\nbelieve that over the past twenty-four months we have retained this focus and it will serve us well as\nour business emerges from this period.”\nThe Bank’s quarterly financial results are summarized in this earnings release, but shareholders are\nencouraged to read the Bank’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is generally available several\nweeks after the earnings release. The Bank expects to file Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on or about November\n6, 2024.\nIncorporated in 1834, Hingham Institution for Savings is one of America’s oldest banks. The Bank\nmaintains offices in Boston, Nantucket, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\nThe Bank’s shares of common stock are listed and traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the\nsymbol HIFS.\nPage

Bank believes the presentation of the following non-GAAP financial measures provide useful\nsupplemental information that is essential to an investor’s proper understanding of results of operations\nand financial condition of the Bank. Management uses these measures in its analysis of the Bank’s\nperformance. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the financial\nmeasures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP\nperformance measures that may be presented by other banks.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between net income and core net income, a non-GAAP\nmeasurement that represents net income excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities and the\nafter-tax gain on disposal of fixed assets.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNon-GAAP reconciliation:\nNet income $ 3,297 $ 5,846 $ 20,056 $ 16,816\nGain on equity securities, net (486) (3,442) (9,424) (11,876)\nIncome tax expense expense (1) 116 759 2,086 2, 618\nGain on disposal of fixed assets (44) — (44) —\nIncome tax expense 12 — 12 —\nCore net income $ 2,895 $ 3,163 $ 12,686 $ 7,558\n(1) The equity securities are held in a tax-advantaged subsidiary corporation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated interim financial statements of Hingham Institution for Savings (the “Bank”) have been prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial statements and\nwith the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nFinancial information as of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, is\nunaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information. Such\nadjustments were of a normal recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire\nyear. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on Form 10-K.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2016-13 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ”\n(“ASC 326”) This new guidance, also referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) method, replaced the incurred loss\nmethod that was utilized in estimating the Bank’s allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) as of December 31, 2022. Under CECL, the\nBank is required to estimate credit losses expected to occur over the life of the financial instrument and to recognize those estimated\nlosses at the time of loan origination.\nThe Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective method; therefore, results for reporting periods beginning on or\nafter January 1, 2023 are presented in accordance with this new guidance while prior period results are reported in accordance with the\npreviously applicable U.S. GAAP. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023 and recorded a $545,000 increase in the\nBank’s ALL for outstanding loans and no change in the reserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments, resulting in a total increase\nin the Bank’s allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) of $545,000. The transition adjustment, net of related tax effects, was recorded as a\ncumulative effect from the change in accounting principle and reduced the Bank’s retained earnings by $392,000.\nThe following table shows the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13.\nJanuary 1, 2023\nAs Reported Under Pre-adoption of Impact of\nASU 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 Adoption\n(In Thousands)\nAllowance for credit losses $ 25,534 $ 24,989 $ 545\nReserve for losses on unfunded loan commitments — — —\nDeferred tax asset 4,061 3,908 153\nRetained earnings 370,366 370,758 (392)\nThe amounts presented for the ACL in the table above reflect changes associated to the Bank’s loan portfolio as of adoption date.\nThe Bank also held $3.5 million in held-to-maturity debt securities as of the adoption date which, based upon management’s\nevaluation, did not require an ACL. The Bank did not hold any securities available-for-sale as of the adoption date.\nManagement also evaluated the Bank’s unfunded commitments, which at the adoption date, included primarily construction loans\nand commercial real estate lines of credit, and determined, based upon an evaluation of probability of funding and risk of loss, that the\nrequired reserve was not material.\nEarnings per common share\nBasic earnings per share represent income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive\npotential shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential shares\nthat may be issued by the Bank relate solely to outstanding stock options and are determined using the treasury stock method. The\namount of excess tax benefit that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the options is not considered in\nthe proceeds when applying the treasury stock method.\n9\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEarnings per common share have been computed based on the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2024 2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nAverage number of shares outstanding - basic earnings per share 2,151 2,180 2,149 2,177\nEffect of dilutive options 41 17 46 15\nAverage number of shares outstanding - diluted earnings per share 2,192 2,197 2,195 2,192\nThere were 2,000 and 1,667 antidilutive options, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as\ncompared to 1,000 and 11,000 antidilutive options, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe Bank groups its assets measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the\nreliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 1 assets generally include debt and\nequity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for\nmarket transactions involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; quoted prices\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the\nfair value of the assets. Level 3 assets include those whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets for which the determination of fair value requires\nsignificant management judgment or estimation.\nLoans\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio includes residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, home equity, commercial and\nconsumer segments. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in the eastern Massachusetts area. The Bank\nalso lends to commercial real estate borrowers in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and in the San Francisco\nBay Area (“SFBA”). The ability of the Bank's debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon real estate, construction, and general\neconomic conditions in these markets.\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at the\namount of their outstanding principal, including deferred loan origination fees and costs, reduced by unearned discounts, and the ACL.\nInterest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred\nand recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method.\nAccrued interest is presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial\nloans is discontinued at the time a loan is 90 days past due (the loan is in default) unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of\ncollection. Personal loans are typically charged off no later than becoming 180 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual\nterms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is\nconsidered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income.\nThe interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status.\nLoans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future\npayments are reasonably assured.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Bank’s ACL is established through a provision for credit losses charged against income. All, or portions of, loans deemed to\nbe uncollectible are charged against the ACL when the Bank believes that collectability of all, or some portion of, outstanding\nprincipal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, of loans previously charged off are credited to the ACL when collected.\n10\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLosses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan, based on expected credit losses for the life\nof the loan balance as of the period end date. The ACL is evaluated quarterly by management and is maintained at a level the Bank\nbelieves will be adequate to absorb expected credit losses in future periods associated with its loan portfolio and unfunded loan\ncommitments as of the period end date. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to\nsignificant revision as more information becomes available. The Bank’s CECL methodology consists of quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents, as described below. This methodology applies to the Bank’s real estate loan portfolio, which at September 30, 2024,\ncomprised virtually 100% of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Consumer and commercial loans that are not secured by real estate are\nevaluated qualitatively.\nFor the quantitative component, the Bank uses an undiscounted cash flow probability-of-default (“PD”) / loss-given-default\n(“LGD”) method, forecasted based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers and using a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast (national unemployment rate). Given the minimal level of loan losses experienced by the Bank over recent\ndecades, the Bank uses statistical data derived from a large group of community banks’ loss experience (“Index”), which incorporates\na combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available. This process includes estimates\nwhich involve projecting loan prepayments, PD and LGD throughout the life of the loan. The PD component is driven by the Call\nReport code and risk rating of the loan (Pass, Watch, Special Mention or Substandard), while the LGD component is driven by the\nCall Report code. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is determined based upon the reasonableness and level of national\nunemployment rate forecast estimates. For periods beyond a reasonable and supportable forecast time frame, the Bank reverts to\nhistorical information over a period for which comparable data is available. In determining the ACL, the Bank utilizes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period which, as of September 30, 2024, was two years followed by a one year mean reversion period. These\nassumptions are reviewed periodically to determine whether they remain appropriate.\nFor the qualitative component, management performs an assessment beyond model estimates, and applies qualitative adjustments\nas deemed necessary. The qualitative components of the ACL consider (i) the Bank’s idiosyncratic lending program attributes to\nwhich management ascribe the Bank’s lower historical losses versus the Index and the industry during periods of stress, such as\nsponsor/borrower quality, collateral valuation approach and loan-to-value, loan structure (contractual provisions, recourse to borrower)\nand collection process, among others; (ii) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios; (iii) certain portfolio characteristics, such as\nportfolio growth, concentrations of credit and delinquencies; (iv) national and local economic and industry conditions which may\naffect borrowers’ ability to pay and/or real estate values and (v) model limitations; among others.\nThe Bank segments its loan receivable population into homogeneous pools of loans which share similar risk characteristics.\nWhen a loan no longer meets the criteria of its initial pooling as a result of credit deterioration or other changes, the Bank may\nevaluate the credit for estimated losses on an individual basis. For loans with real estate collateral, when management determines that\nforeclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling\ncosts as appropriate. While an individual assessment and related ACL may be calculated for non-performing loans, no portion of the\nBank’s ACL is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire ACL is available to absorb losses from any and all\nloans, including unfunded loan commitments.\nResidential real estate – The Bank generally does not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80% (without private\nmortgage insurance). All loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate that is owner-occupied at the time of\norigination and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including\nunemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans\nin Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nCommercial real estate – Loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties throughout Massachusetts, the\nWMA and the SFBA. Underwriting and portfolio management policies are the same across all markets. Loan amounts do not exceed\n75% of the appraised value of the collateral. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties could be adversely impacted by a\ndownturn in the economy leading to increased vacancy rates which, in turn, would have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.\nManagement obtains rent rolls annually and regularly monitors the cash flows of these loans.\nConstruction – Loans in this segment include both owner-occupied and speculative real estate development loans for which payment\nis derived from sale of the property. Credit risk could be affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, the overall health\nof the economy and market conditions. The Bank only originates these loans in Massachusetts and in the WMA.\nHome equity – Loans in this segment include equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans, and are generally collateralized by\nsecond liens on residential real estate. Repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The Bank generally\ndoes not originate loans with combined loan-to-value ratios greater than 70% when taking into account both the balance of the home\nequity loans and the first mortgage loan. Similar to residential real estate, the overall health of the economy, including unemployment\nrates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. The Bank only originates these loans in\nMassachusetts. The Bank generally will not originate these loans unless it holds the senior lien position on the collateral property.\n11\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCommercial – Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is\nexpected from the cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect\non the credit quality in this segment. These loans are not a focus of the Bank’s origination program and are only originated in\nMassachusetts.\nConsumer – Loans in this segment are generally unsecured lines of credit and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the\nindividual borrower. The Bank is no longer offering these loans.\nThe Bank has elected not to measure an ACL on accrued interest and to write off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a\ntimely manner.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe expected credit losses for unfunded commitments are measured over the contractual period of the Bank’s exposure to credit\nrisk. The estimate of credit loss incorporates assumptions for both the likelihood and amount of funding over the estimated life of the\ncommitments, for the risk of loss, and current conditions and expectations. Management periodically reviews and updates the\nassumptions.\nLeases\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases , the Bank records operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”)\nassets and operating lease liabilities relating to operating leases for some of its banking offices. These lease agreements have lease\nand non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The ROU asset is included in other assets and the operating\nlease liability is included in other liabilities on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, the ROU asset was\n$206,000 and the corresponding operating lease liability was $224,000. Operating lease costs for both the quarters ended September\n30, 2023 and 2024 were $61,000. Operating lease costs for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $183,000.\nThe maturities of lease liabilities are as follows at September 30, 2024:\nYears Amount\n(In Thousands)\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 46\n2025 146\n2026 37\nTotal lease payments 229\nImputed interest (5)\nTotal lease liability $ 224\nNOTE 2: COMMITMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, outstanding loan commitments were as follows:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nUnused lines of credit $ 154,917 $ 147,260\nCommitments to originate loans 56,462 99,238\nUnadvanced funds on construction loans 145,910 84,988\nStandby letters-of-credit 105 169\nTotal $ 357,394 $ 331,655\nNOTE 3: DIVIDEND DECLARATION\nOn September 25, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share to all stockholders of record as of\nNovember 4, 2024, payable November 13, 2024.\n12\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNOTE 4: FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nDetermination of Fair Value\nThe Bank uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances,\nthere are no quoted market prices for the Bank’s assets and liabilities. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair\nvalues are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the\nassumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be\nrealized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. There are no liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Value\n(In Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nEquity securities $ 71,517 $ 8,285 $ — $ 79,802\nSeptember 30, 2024\nEquity securities $ 84,403 $ 13,241 $ — $ 97,644\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nThe Bank may also be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of\nindividual assets.\nThere are no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\n13\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSummary of Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nThe estimated fair values, determined using the exit price notion, and related carrying amounts, of the Bank’s financial\ninstruments are as follows. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are exempt from disclosure requirements.\nAccordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented herein do not represent the underlying fair value of the Bank.\nCarrying Fair Value\nAmount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 362,477 $ 362,477 $ — $ —\nEquity securities 79,802 71,517 8,285 —\nSecurities held to maturity 3,500 — — 2,996\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 69,574 — — 69,574\nLoans, net 3,914,244 — — 3,734,046\nAccrued interest receivable 8,554 — — 8,554\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 2,349,977 $ — $ — $ 2,347,731\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances 1,692,675 — 1,701,000 —\nMortgagors’ escrow accounts 13,942 — — 13,942\nAccrued interest payable 12,261 — — 12,261\nSeptember 30, 2024\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 368,100 $ 368,100 $ — $ —\nEquity securities 97,644 84,403 13,241 —\nSecurities held to maturity 6,493 — — 6,167\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 62,812 — — 62,812\nLoans, net 3,863,105 — — 3,732,255\nAccrued interest receivable 8,395 — — 8,395\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits $ 2,461,132 $ — $ — $ 2,462,458\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances 1,530,500 — 1,548,122 —\nMortgagors’ escrow accounts 14,589 — — 14,589\nAccrued interest payable 11,025 — — 11,025\n14\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNOTE 5: SECURITIES\nSecurities held to maturity\nAt December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024 securities held to maturity totaled $3.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nThese investments include solely debt instruments issued by other banks and bank holding companies, including an issuer in which the\nBank also holds a common equity investment. These notes are typically fixed or fixed-to-floating rate and some have call features. At\nDecember 31, 2023, $3.5 million were callable quarterly at the option of the issuer beginning in May 2026. At September 30, 2024,\n$3.5 million and $993,000, respectively, were callable by the issuer quarterly beginning in May 2026 and September 2024,\nrespectively.\nThe Bank intends to hold the bonds until maturity, and therefore they are recorded at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. There was no other-than-temporary impairment recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.\nEquity securities\nAt December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity securities include a $8.9 million and $9.0 million investment in the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act Qualified Investment Fund, respectively, and a $70.9 million and $88.6 million investment in\nmarketable common equity securities, respectively.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of equity securities amounted to $1.4 million, as compared\nto $208,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains recognized during the third quarter of 2023 on\nsecurities still held at September 30, 2023 were $605,000, as compared to unrealized gains of $3.4 million recognized during the third\nquarter of 2024 on securities still held at September 30, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of equity securities amounted to $1.4 million, as compared to\n$208,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Unrealized gains recognized during the first nine months of 2023 on\nsecurities still held at September 30, 2023 were $9.5 million, as compared to unrealized gains of $11.8 million recognized during the\nfirst nine months of 2024 on securities still held at September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 6: LOANS AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nLoans by category\nA summary of the balances of loans outstanding is as follows:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2024\n(In Thousands)\nReal estate loans:\nResidential $ 494,032 $ 466,293\nCommercial 3,155,284 3,178,787\nConstruction 268,610 218,566\nHome equity 22,518 26,133\nTotal real estate loans 3,940,444 3,889,779\nOther loans:\nCommercial 95 71\nConsumer 357 235\nTotal other loans 452 306\nTotal loans 3,940,896 3,890,085\nAllowance for credit losses (26,652) (26,980)\nLoans, net $ 3,914,244 $ 3,863,105\nA blanket lien on “qualified collateral,” defined principally as 78-79% of the market value of first mortgage loans on certain\nowner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential property, 66% of the market value of first mortgage loans on certain multi-family\nresidential property and 66% of the market value of loans on certain commercial property, is used to secure borrowings from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank.

This category includes loans on the\nBank’s watchlist that do not warrant a lower rating.\nLoans rated 4 : Loans in this category are considered “special mention.” These loans are currently protected, but exhibit conditions\nthat have the potential for weakness. The borrower may be affected by unfavorable economic, market or other external conditions that\nmay affect their ability to repay the debt. These may also include credits where there is deterioration of the collateral or have\ndeficiencies which may affect our ability to collect on the collateral. This rating is consistent with the “Other Assets Especially\nMentioned” category used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).\n17\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLoans rated 5 : Loans in this category are considered “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately\nprotected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that\nthe Bank will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.\nLoans rated 6 : Loans in this category are considered “doubtful.” Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in\nthose classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of\ncurrently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans rated 7 : Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is\nnot warranted.\nCommercial real estate loans are assigned an initial risk rating by the Bank at the origination of the loan. Subsequently, the Bank\nhas a quality control program performed by an independent third party. Quarterly, all new commercial real estate, construction and\nresidential real estate loan relationships with outstanding balances or commitments of $500,000 or more are reviewed and assigned a\nrisk rating. Loans in the Bank’s watchlist are reviewed quarterly and an in-depth review is performed twice a year on all commercial\nreal estate relationships (and related residential loans) with exposure in excess of $850,000. Commercial real estate relationships (and\nrelated residential loans) with exposure between $500,000 and $850,000 are reviewed at least annually. Watchlist loans are those\nloans that are more than two payments past due at the end of the quarter, loans for which the borrowing entity or sponsor has filed\nbankruptcy, loans rated four or higher in a previous review, impaired loans, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, and loans past contractual maturity. Results of the independent loan review are reported to the Bank’s Audit\nCommittee on a quarterly basis and become the mechanism for monitoring the overall credit quality of the portfolio.\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of December 31, 2023:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,083 $ 239,232 $ — $ — $ 492,508\n4 — — — — 161 1,363 — — 1,524\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 29,246 $ 40,306 $ 75,583 $ 66,058 $ 42,244 $ 240,595 $ — $ — $ 494,032\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 263,870 $ 882,771 $ 846,735 $ 468,384 $ 255,146 $ 380,045 $ 58,333 $ — $ 3,155,284\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 88,334 $ 157,405 $ 18,304 $ 4,567 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 268,610\n18\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (concluded)\nThe following tables presents the Bank’s loans by risk rating as of September 30, 2024:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nTerm loans amortized cost basis by origination year\nRevolving\nloans\nRevolving converted\nRating 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior loans to term Total\n(In Thousands)\nResidential\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 10,900 $ 28,207 $ 37,733 $ 72,272 $ 61,775 $ 253,409 $ — $ — $ 464,296\n4 — — — — — 1,997 — — 1,997\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 10,900 $ 28,207 $ 37,733 $ 72,272 $ 61,775 $ 255,406 $ — $ — $ 466,293\nCommercial\nReal Estate:\n1- 3B $ 95,249 $ 260,921 $ 890,976 $ 832,134 $ 453,959 $ 597,166 $ 48,382 $ — $ 3,178,787\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n5 — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 95,249 $ 260,921 $ 890,976 $ 832,134 $ 453,959 $ 597,166 $ 48,382 $ — $ 3,178,787\nConstruction:\n1- 3B $ 30,908 $ 61,118 $ 126,540 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 218,566\n4 — — — — — — — — —\n— — — — — — — — —\n5\nTotal $ 30,908 $ 61,118 $ 126,540 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 218,566\nResidential real estate loans are rated 1-3B at origination with subsequent adjustments based on delinquency or upon review if\nincluded in the scope of the Bank’s loan review process described above.

Matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our\npublic disclosures, whether written or oral, relating to future events or our future performance, including any discussion, expressed or\nimplied, of our anticipated growth, operating results, future earnings per share, plans and objectives, contain forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThese statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “continue,” “intend,” “expect,”\n“future,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions that are not statements of historical fact. These statements are not guarantees of future\nperformance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including changes in political and\neconomic climate, interest rate fluctuations and competitive product and pricing pressures within the Bank’s market, bond market\nfluctuations, personal and corporate customers’ bankruptcies and inflation. Our actual results and timing of certain events could differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those\nset forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings with the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). It is routine for internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter\nin the year progresses and, therefore, it should be clearly understood that all forward-looking statements and the internal projections\nand beliefs upon which we base our expectations included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may change. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the\nfuture, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Bank’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments\ninvolving significant estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of its accounting policies about the effects of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and\nchanges in this information over time could materially impact amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements as a result of\nthe use of different estimates and assumptions. Certain accounting policies, by their nature, have a greater reliance on the use of\nestimates and assumptions and could produce results materially different from those originally reported.\nBased on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, estimates and assumptions underlying reported amounts,\nthe most significant accounting estimate followed by the Bank has been identified by management as the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”). This policy requires the most subjective and complex judgments and, as such, could be most\nsubject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying\nthis accounting estimate is essential in order to understand the Bank’s reported financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2023, the Bank adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which impacted the Bank’s methodology for estimating the ACL. This accounting\npolicy and its application in recent periods is described in more detail in the “Provision for Credit Losses” section of this discussion\nand analysis and in Note 1 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements”\nelsewhere in this report.\nIn developing the ACL estimate, management considers historical charge-offs, loan-to-value ratios, underlying collateral values,\npayment history, the size of the loan portfolio and the risks associated with certain loan types as well as other factors such as local\neconomic trends, market conditions and credit concentrations. The Bank’s ACL estimate is determined using a probability-of-default\n/ loss-given default undiscounted cash flow model (“Model”), adjusted by management’s qualitative factors. Given the Bank’s long\nterm history of immaterial net charge-offs, the Model relies on statistical information derived from the loss experience of an index\ncomposed of other community banks, and is largely dependent on management’s qualitative factors, which are determined based on\nthe elements described above. Therefore, the estimate is sensitive to the Model’s parameters and assumptions, and management’s\nsubjectivity in the assessment of the qualitative factors.\nIf management’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the ACL is inadequate to absorb expected losses, or if\nbank regulatory authorities require the Bank to increase the ACL as a part of their examination process, the Bank’s earnings and\ncapital could be significantly and adversely affected.\nNote on Core Return on Average Equity and Core Return on Average Assets and Other Non-U.S. GAAP Measures\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities , equity securities (except those\naccounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value\nwith changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income, regardless of\nwhether such gains and losses are realized, and included in the other income (loss) category. This change affects the Bank’s portfolio\n20\nof marketable equity securities, which includes common equity securities and a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify\nfor the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) securities test. This portfolio primarily includes common equity investments, which\nthe Bank views as long-term partnership interests in operating companies. Consequently, the Bank does not view the quarterly\nfluctuation in market value as indicative of the change in the intrinsic value of these portfolio holdings. The performance of these\nholdings should be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to growth in book value per share over time, not via quarterly\nadjustments to net income.\nConsistent with this view, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nincorporates core net income, core return on average equity, and core return on average assets, which are non-U.S. GAAP\nmeasurements that exclude the after-tax effect of gain (loss) on equity securities, net, both realized and unrealized. These disclosures\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable to non-U.S. GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation between net income and core net income for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2024:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNon-U.S. GAAP reconciliation:\nNet Income $ 3,297 $ 5,846 $ 20,056 $ 16,816\nGain on equity securities, net (486) (3,442) (9,424) (11,876)\nIncome tax expense (1) 116 759 2,086 2,618\nGain on disposal of fixed assets (44) — (44) —\nIncome tax expense 12 — 12 —\nCore Net Income $ 2,895 $ 3,163 $ 12,686 $ 7,558\n(1) The equity securities are held in a tax-advantaged subsidiary corporation. The income tax effect of the gain on equity securities,\nnet, was calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to the subsidiary.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents total operating expenses, divided by the sum of net interest income and total other income,\nexcluding gain on equity securities, net, is a non-U.S. GAAP performance measure used by management to assess operational\nefficiency. The table below presents the calculation of the efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2024:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, unaudited) 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNon-U.S. GAAP efficiency ratio calculation:\nOperating expenses $ 7,043 $ 7,315 $ 21,349 $ 21,836\nNet interest income $ 10,986 $ 11,481 $ 38,927 $ 30,933\nOther income 804 3,724 10,304 12,700\nGain on equity securities, net (486) (3,442) (9,424) (11,876)\nGain on disposal of fixed assets (44) — (44) —\nTotal revenue $ 11,260 $ 11,763 $ 39,763 $ 31,757\nEfficiency ratio 62.55 % 62.19 % 53.69 % 68.76 %\nAs the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced by the level of net interest income, the Bank also utilizes annualized\noperating expenses as a percentage of average assets to evaluate operational efficiency.\nINTRODUCTION\nNet income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $5,846,000 or $2.68 per share basic and $2.66 per share diluted, as\ncompared to $3,297,000 or $1.53 per share basic and $1.50 per share diluted in earnings for the third quarter of 2023. The Bank’s\nannualized return on average equity for the third quarter of 2024 was 5.52%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.54%,\nas compared to 3.25% and 0.31% for the same period in 2023. Core net income for the third quarter of 2024, which represents net\nincome excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities, both realized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on the disposal of fixed\nassets (on the prior year), was $3,163,000 or $1.45 per share basic and $1.44 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return\non average equity of 2.99% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.29%. This compares to core net income of\n$2,895,000 or $1.35 per share basic and $1.32 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 2.85%\n21\nand an annualized core return on average assets of 0.27% for the same period in 2023.\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $16,816,000 or $7.73 per share basic and $7.67 per share diluted\nas compared to $20,056,000 or $9.33 per share basic and $9.14 per share diluted for the same period last year. The Bank’s annualized\nreturn on average equity for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.35%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.52%, as\ncompared to 6.70% and 0.64% for the same period in 2023. Excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities, both realized and\nunrealized, and after-tax gain on the disposal of fixed assets (on the prior year), core net income for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 was $7,558,000 or $3.47 per share basic and $3.45 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average\nequity of 2.41% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.23%. This compares to core net income of $12,686,000 or $5.90\nper share basic and $5.78 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 4.24% and an annualized core\nreturn on average assets of 0.41% for the same period in 2023.\nThe net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased two basis points to 1.07%, as compared to 1.05% for the same\nperiod in 2023. The Bank experienced an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the\ninterest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (“FRBB”), a higher Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB”)\nstock dividend and an increase in the yield on loans. During this period, the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was\npartially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the prior year. This was driven primarily by\nthe repricing of the Bank’s wholesale borrowings, wholesale deposits and higher rates on the Bank’s retail and commercial deposits.\nThe net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 30 basis points to 0.96%, as compared to 1.26% for\nthe same period last year. The Bank experienced a substantial increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities when compared to the\nprior year. This was driven primarily by the repricing of the Bank’s wholesale borrowings, wholesale deposits and higher rates on the\nBank’s retail and commercial deposits. During this period, the increase in the cost of funds was partially offset by a higher yield on\ninterest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the interest on reserves held at the FRBB, a higher FHLB stock dividend and\nan increase in the yield on loans.\nTotal assets decreased by $34.2 million from December 31, 2023 and increased $93.0 million from September 30, 2023,\nrepresenting a 1% annualized decline year-to-date and 2% growth from September 30, 2023. Net loans decreased by $51.1 million\nfrom December 31, 2023 and increased $54.5 million from September 30, 2023, representing a 2% annualized decline year-to-date\nand 1% growth from September 30, 2023. Total deposits, including wholesale deposits, increased to $2.461 billion at September 30,\n2024, representing 6% annualized growth year-to-date and 2% growth from September 30, 2023. Total retail and business deposits\nincreased to $1.977 billion at September 30, 2024, representing 8% annualized growth year-to-date and 3% growth from September\n30, 2023. Non-interest-bearing deposits, included in retail and business deposits, increased to $358.0 million at September 30, 2024,\nrepresenting 7% annualized growth year-to-date and stable when compared to September 30, 2023. In the first nine months of 2024,\nthe Bank continued to focus on developing and deepening deposit relationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit\ncustomers, retaining maturing time deposit balances, and managing its wholesale funding mix between wholesale time deposits and\nFHLB advances in order to take advantage of the inverted curve, while helping to mitigate the negative impact of elevated short term\nrates in the cost of funds.\nStockholders’ equity increased to $421.7 million as of September 30, 2024, representing 5% annualized growth year-to-date and a\n5% increase from September 30, 2023. Book value per share increased to $193.42 per share at September 30, 2024, from $188.50 per\nshare at December 31, 2023 and $186.74 per share at September 30, 2023. Since September 30, 2023, the Bank declared dividends of\n$2.52 per share.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the third quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, non-performing assets\ntotaled 0.04% of total assets, compared with 0.03% at December 31, 2023 and 0.00% at September 30, 2023. Non-performing loans\nas a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.04% at September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and\n0.01% at September 30, 2023.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents total operating expenses, divided by the sum of net interest income and total other income,\nexcluding gain on equity securities, net, and the gain on disposal of fixed assets, decreased to 62.19% for the third quarter of 2024, as\ncompared to 62.55% in the same period last year. Operating expenses (annualized) as a percentage of average assets rose to 0.68% for\nthe third quarter of 2024, as compared to 0.67% for the same period last year. As the efficiency ratio can be significantly influenced\nby the level of net interest income, the Bank utilizes these paired figures together to assess its operational efficiency over time. During\nperiods of significant net interest income volatility, the efficiency ratio in isolation may over or understate the underlying operational\nefficiency of the Bank. The Bank remains focused on reducing waste through an ongoing process of continuous improvement and\nstandard work that supports operational leverage. These figures reflect the Bank’s continued focus on credit quality and disciplined\nexpense management.\nThe Bank continues to exceed all of the minimum regulatory capital requirements.\n22\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nGeneral\nThe Bank reported net income of $5.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $3.3 million for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. Net income was $2.68 per share basic and $2.66 per share diluted for the quarter ended September\n30, 2024 as compared to $1.53 per share basic and $1.50 per share diluted for the same period in 2023. Earnings for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were positively impacted by an increase of $2.9 million in other income, an increase of $495,000 in net interest\nincome and a $201,000 decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase of $795,000 in the income tax\nprovision and a $272,000 increase in operating expenses. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was 5.52%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.54%, compared to 3.25% and 0.31%, respectively,\nfor the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the third quarter of 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gain on equity securities, both\nrealized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on disposal of fixed assets (on the prior year) was $3.2 million or $1.45 per share basic\nand $1.44 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 2.99% and an annualized core return on\naverage assets of 0.29%. This compares to core net income of $2.9 million or $1.35 per share basic and $1.32 per share diluted,\nrepresenting an annualized core return on average equity of 2.85% and an annualized core return on average assets of 0.27% for the\nsame period in 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $11.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 and $11.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The $495,000\nincrease was due to a $72.5 million, or 2%, increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a five basis point decrease in\nthe weighted average spread in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. For the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, the weighted average rate spread and net interest margin were 0.34% and 1.07%, respectively, compared to\n0.39% and 1.05%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $58.7\nmillion, or 2% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 35 basis points during the same period.\nIn early 2022, after a sustained period of lower short term market rates, the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities began to\nmove up sharply following the increase in short term market interest rates. This trend, which accelerated in the second half of 2022\nand in 2023, began to abate this year and reverted in the third quarter, as the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds target\nrate at the end of the quarter. A higher average yield on interest-earning assets, driven primarily by an increase in the yield on loans\nand securities, was partially offset by a higher average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. This resulted in a higher net interest margin\nin the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This is the first quarter, since the beginning\nof the recent cycle, that the Bank’s quarterly net interest margin expanded on a year-over-year basis.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $4.4 million to $49.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $45.0\nmillion for the third quarter of 2023, driven by the increase in average interest-earning assets discussed above and a higher yield. The\nyield on total interest-earning assets was 4.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.32% for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased by $4.8 million when comparing the two periods, primarily resulting from a 3% increase in\naverage loan balances, combined with a 33 basis point increase in yield. The increase in yield was driven primarily by a higher yield\non loans, reflecting both an increase in average loan rate - as the Bank continued to originate loans at higher rates and reprice existing\nloans, as well as higher loan fee income.\nSecurities and short-term investments, which include the Bank’s cash holdings at the FRBB, accounted for 8% of the total average\ninterest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as the\nBank continued to manage its balance sheet to reduce the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. This was partially offset by an\nincrease in the fair value of the Bank’s equity securities portfolio when compared to the prior year. Combined income for these\ncategories decreased by $366,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to a $41.4 million decrease in combined average\nbalances - reflecting primarily a lower average balance of cash held at the FRBB, partially offset by a higher combined average yield.\nThe higher yield was the result of a higher dividend on the Bank’s stock investment at the FHLB, partially offset by lower rate on cash\nheld at the FRBB.\nThe average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.28% for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.93% for the comparable\nquarter of 2023. Total interest expense increased by $3.9 million when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\ndue to higher interest rates on deposits and borrowings, combined with higher aggregate average balances.\nInterest expense on deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $1.4 million over the same period in 2023, due to a 45 basis\npoint increase in the weighted average rate, partially offset by a decrease of $129.2 million in average interest-bearing deposits. After\na sustained period of historically low short term rates, beginning in early 2022 the Bank observed rising market pricing for term\ndeposits, money market accounts, and wholesale funds. This trend, which was sustained during 2022 and 2023, began to abate this\nyear and reverted in the third quarter, as the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds target rate at the end of the quarter. The\nBank continued to manage core product rates, implemented special offerings, and continued to use wholesale time deposits to remain\ncompetitive while balancing cost versus growth.\n23\nInterest expense on borrowed funds for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $2.6 million as compared to the same quarter in\n2023, primarily due to a 10 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, combined with a $187.8 million increase in average\nbalances. The increase in the FHLB borrowings rate was primarily driven by a smaller share of the borrowed funds mix allocated to\nlower rate FHLB HLB-Option advances in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by lower\naverage rate on regular advances, as the Bank has extended liabilities to take advantage of the curve inversion. The FHLB provides an\nexplanation of HLB-Option Advances on its website under the “Products” section that explains the features of this product.\nThe following tables detail components of net interest income and yields/rates on daily average earning assets/liabilities.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2023 2024\nAVERAGE YIELD/ AVERAGE YIELD/\nBALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9) BALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9)\n(In Thousands)\nLoans (1) (2) $ 3,802,045 $ 40,245 4.23 % $ 3,915,967 $ 45,035 4.56 %\nSecurities (3) (4) 107,432 1,195 4.45 122,715 1,625 5.25\nFederal Reserve and other short-term investments 264,160 3,598 5.45 207,446 2,802 5.36\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,173,637 45,038 4.32 4,246,128 49,462 4.62\nOther assets 61,529 69,148\nTotal assets $ 4,235,166 $ 4,315,276\nInterest-bearing deposits (5) $ 2,200,952 20,010 3.64 $ 2,071,780 21,371 4.09\nBorrowed funds 1,261,652 14,042 4.45 1,449,491 16,610 4.55\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,462,604 34,052 3.93 3,521,271 37,981 4.28\nDemand deposits 353,543 355,768\nOther liabilities 12,958 14,577\nTotal liabilities 3,829,105 3,891,616\nStockholders’ equity 406,061 423,660\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,235,166 $ 4,315,276\nNet interest income $ 10,986 $ 11,481\nWeighted average spread 0.39 % 0.34 %\nNet interest margin (6) 1.05 % 1.07 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average\ninterest-bearing liabilities (7) 120.53 % 120.59 %\n(1) Before allowance for credit losses.\n(2) Includes average non-accrual loans.\n(3) Excludes the impact of the average net unrealized gain or loss on securities.\n(4) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n(5) Includes mortgagors' escrow accounts.\n(6) Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(7) Total interest-earning assets divided by total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8) Average balances are calculated on a daily basis.\n(9) Annualized.

The Bank determined that a $545,000 adjustment to increase the allowance\nfor credit losses and no reserve for unfunded commitments was required upon adoption. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nAt September 30, 2024, management's review of the allowance for credit losses concluded that a balance of $27.0 million was\nadequate to provide for losses based upon evaluation of risk in the loan portfolio. During the third quarter of 2024, management\nprovided $40,000 to achieve such an allowance for credit loss balance at September 30, 2024. Comparably, at September 30, 2023,\nmanagement’s evaluation of the balance of the allowance for loan losses indicated the need for a quarterly provision of $241,000.\nCredit quality remained strong with no delinquent or non performing commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024. The\nBank did not record any charge-offs in the third quarters of 2024 or 2023.\nSee Notes 1 and 6 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and “Loans and Foreclosed Real Estate”\nincluded in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information pertaining to the allowance for credit losses.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of gain on equity securities, net, customer service fees on deposits, increases in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance policies, gain on disposal of fixed assets, and miscellaneous income. Total other income was $3.7\nmillion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income of $804,000 for the same period in 2023. In the third\nquarter of 2024, the Bank recorded gains totaling $3.4 million on equity securities, including $3.4 million of unrealized gains on\nequity securities held at the end of the period and $45,000 of gains recognized on equity securities sold during the period. In the third\nquarter of 2023, the Bank recorded gains totaling $486,000 on equity securities, including $605,000 of unrealized gains on equity\nsecurities held at the end of the period and $119,000 of losses recognized on equity securities sold during the period.\nCustomer service fees on deposits increased marginally in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In\nrecent years, there has been a continuous decline in deposit account transaction fees, as the Bank has eliminated many fees on deposit\nproducts to simplify offerings and enhance the value proposition of our consumer and business checking accounts to customers. This\ntrend has subsided as the Bank has eliminated the majority of these fees. Generally, the Bank’s strategy does not rely on generating\nsubstantial non-interest fee-based revenue from our deposit accounts.\nAn increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance also contributed to other income during the third quarters of\n2024 and 2023. The Bank held $13.9 million in life insurance policies at September 30, 2024 as compared to $13.6 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. Income from these\nassets is fully excludable from federal income taxes and contributed $94,000 to other income in the third quarter of 2024, as compared\nto $84,000 for the same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, deposit insurance,\nmarketing, foreclosure and related, and other general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses were $7.3 million, or an\nannualized 0.68% of average total assets, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $7.0 million, or an annualized\n0.67% of average total assets, for the same period of 2023.\n25\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses increased by $168,000, or 4%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the same period in 2023, primarily due to annual merit-based salary increases, enhancements to our operational teams and higher\npayroll taxes, partially offset by reductions in executive pay implemented during 2023. The number of employees remained relatively\nstable, reflecting additional staff in our Specialized Deposit Group (“SDG”) and operational teams, offset by a smaller branch staff.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses decreased by $27,000, or 6%, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. The decrease in 2024 was primarily driven by lower maintenance expenses, partially offset by lower rental income recorded in\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The Bank owns rental apartments located above\nits Nantucket branch which are rented during the summer season.\nData processing expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $50,000, or 7%, when compared to the same period in 2023,\ndriven primarily by higher data processing charges associated with improvements made to the Bank's systems and volume increases in\n2024. Technology spending at the Bank remains focused on three primary objectives: delivering new or improved customer\nexperience, reducing costs through simplification and automation of internal processes, and securing customer and Bank confidential\ninformation.\nDeposit insurance expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $77,000, or 12%, when compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase was the result of a higher assessed rate, combined with a larger assessment base, driven by the Bank’s balance\nsheet growth. Deposit insurance expense consists of premiums paid to the FDIC and the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund\n(“DIF”). The FDIC assessment rate is determined based on several factors, including capitalization, asset growth, earnings, use of\nbrokered deposits and level of non-performing assets, among others, and is calculated on an assessment base that takes into\nconsideration the Bank’s average total assets and average tangible equity, among other factors. The DIF assessment rate is based on\nan institution’s risk category, which is defined based on similar factors. Effective the first quarterly assessment period of 2023, the\nFDIC implemented a system-wide increase that applied to all banks, which increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate\nby 2 basis points. This is part of a long-planned effort by the FDIC to return the funded status of the FDIC insurance fund to a higher\nlevel. The Bank carefully manages its balance sheet to control the deposit insurance expense associated with excess liquidity while\noptimizing its funding mix.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $11,000, or 7%, for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as the\nBank continues to carefully manage these expenses focusing on business development for the Bank’s Commercial Real Estate Group\nand SDG. The Bank continued to allocate its marketing spending during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 towards supporting its\ncommercial deposit acquisition activities in Boston, the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (“WMA”) and the San Francisco\nBay Area (“SFBA”).\nForeclosure and related expenses include expenses associated with the collection and foreclosure process, such as legal, tax,\nappraisal, insurance and other related foreclosure expenses. These expenses may be recovered when the loan returns to performing\nstatus or when the Bank exercises its remedies, as they are generally secured by the Bank’s mortgages. Such recoveries, if any, are\nreflected in future periods as contra-expense. The Bank recorded $15,000 in foreclosure and related expenses in the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to $29,000 in the same period in 2023. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September\n30, 2023, the Bank did not own any foreclosed property.\nOther general and administrative expenses, which include director fees, supplies, deposit/card related losses and audit-related\nexpenses, among others, increased by $29,000, or 3%, when comparing the two periods, reflecting higher miscellaneous expenses,\nincluding audit, insurance, legal fees and loan related expenses, partially offset by lower deposit/debit card related losses and travel\nexpenses associated with the Bank’s operations in the WMA and SFBA. In addition, in the third quarter of 2023, the Bank incurred\nloan real estate tax related penalties that were refunded to the Bank in the subsequent quarter.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Bank recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established\nfor the temporary difference between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. The Bank's deferred tax asset\nis reviewed quarterly by management as to the realizability of such asset.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded $2.0 million, or 25.5% of pre-tax income, in tax expense as compared to $1.2\nmillion, or 26.8%, for the same quarter in 2023. The lower effective tax rate was primarily the result of higher unrealized gains on\nequity securities recognized during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, as these securities are\nheld at a tax-advantaged subsidiary. The Bank did not recognize excess tax benefit on the exercise of stock options in the third quarter\nof 2024, as compared to $64,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n26\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCOMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nGeneral\nThe Bank reported net income of $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $20.1 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income was $7.73 per share basic and $7.67 per share diluted for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to $9.33 per share basic and $9.14 per share diluted for the same period in 2023. Earnings for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by a decrease of $8.0 million in net interest income and a\n$487,000 increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in other income, a $519,000 decrease in the\nprovision for credit losses and a decrease of $2.3 million in the income tax provision. The Bank’s annualized return on average equity\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.35%, and the annualized return on average assets was 0.52%, compared to\n6.70% and 0.64%, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\nCore net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents net income excluding the after-tax gain on\nequity securities, both realized and unrealized, and the after-tax gain on disposal of fixed assets (on the prior year), was $7.6 million or\n$3.47 per share basic and $3.45 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 2.41% and an\nannualized core return on average assets of 0.23%. This compares to core net income of $12.7 million or $5.90 per share basic and\n$5.78 per share diluted, representing an annualized core return on average equity of 4.24% and an annualized core return on average\nassets of 0.41% for the same period in 2023.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $30.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $38.9 million for the first nine months of\n2023. The $8.0 million decrease was due to a 41 basis point decrease in the weighted average spread, partially offset by a $167.5\nmillion, or 4%, increase in average interest-earning assets in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\nFor the first nine months of 2024, the weighted average rate spread and net interest margin were 0.24% and 0.96%, respectively, as\ncompared to 0.65% and 1.26%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $171.5\nmillion, or 5% and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 80 basis points during the same period.\nIn early 2022, after a sustained period of lower short term market rates, the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities began to\nmove up sharply following the increase in short term market interest rates. This trend, which accelerated in the second half of 2022\nand in 2023, began to abate this year and reverted in the third quarter, as the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds target\nrate. The higher average rate on interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a higher average yield on interest-earning assets,\ndriven primarily by an increase in the yield on loans, securities and short-term investments. This resulted in a lower net interest\nmargin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\nInterest and dividend income increased by $18.2 million to $146.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to\n$127.8 million for the first nine months 2023, driven by the increase in average interest-earning assets discussed above, combined\nwith a higher yield. The yield on total interest-earning assets was 4.55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared\nto 4.15% for the same period in 2023.\nInterest income on loans increased by $18.4 million when comparing the two periods, primarily resulting from a 6% increase in\naverage loan balances, combined with a 40 basis point increase in yield. The increase in yield was driven primarily by a higher yield\non loans, reflecting both an increase in average loan rate - as the Bank continued to originate loans at higher rates and reprice existing\nloans, as well as higher loan fee income.\nSecurities and short-term investments, which include the Bank’s cash holdings at the FRBB, accounted for 8% of the total average\ninterest-earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nas the Bank continued to manage its balance sheet to reduce the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. This was partially\noffset by an increase in the fair value of the Bank’s equity securities portfolio when compared to the prior year. Combined income for\nthese categories decreased by $154,000 when comparing the two periods, primarily due to a $45.9 million decrease in combined\naverage balances - reflecting primarily a lower average balance of cash held at the FRBB, partially offset by a higher combined\naverage yield. The higher yield was the result of a higher dividend on the Bank’s stock investment at the FHLB and higher rate on\ncash held at the FRBB.\nThe average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 4.30% for the first nine months of 2024 from 3.50% for the\ncomparable period in 2023. Total interest expense increased by $26.2 million when comparing the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 due to higher interest rates on deposits and borrowings, combined with higher aggregate average balances.\nInterest expense on deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $14.0 million over the same period in\n2023, due to a 104 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, partially offset by a decrease of $109.1 million in average\ninterest-bearing deposits. After a sustained period of historically low short term rates, beginning in early 2022 the Bank observed\nrising market pricing for term deposits, money market accounts, and wholesale funds. This trend, which was sustained during 2022\nand 2023, began to abate this year and reverted in the third quarter, as the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds target rate.\nThe Bank continued to manage core product rates, implemented special offerings, and continued to use wholesale time deposits to\nremain competitive while balancing cost versus growth.\nInterest expense on borrowed funds for the first nine months of 2024 increased by $12.2 million as compared to the same period\n27\nin 2023, primarily due to a 27 basis point increase in the weighted average rate, combined with a $280.1 million increase in average\nbalances. The increase in the FHLB borrowings rate was primarily driven by the higher short-term market rates, partially offset by the\nhigher average balance of lower rate FHLB HLB-Option advances in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in\n2023. The FHLB provides an explanation of HLB-Option Advances on its website under the “Products' ' section that explains the\nfeatures of this product.\nThe following tables detail components of net interest income and yields/rates on daily average earning assets/liabilities.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2023 2024\nAVERAGE YIELD/ AVERAGE YIELD/\nBALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9) BALANCE(8) INTEREST RATE (9)\n(In Thousands)\nLoans (1) (2) $ 3,737,198 $ 114,467 4.08 % $ 3,950,610 $ 132,820 4.48 %\nSecurities (3) (4) 103,454 3,208 4.13 119,477 4,758 5.30\nFederal Reserve and other short-term investments 267,922 10,078 5.02 206,029 8,374 5.41\nTotal interest-earning assets 4,108,574 127,753 4.15 4,276,116 145,952 4.55\nOther assets 57,360 66,477\nTotal assets $ 4,165,934 $ 4,342,593\nInterest-bearing deposits (5) $ 2,215,719 50,618 3.05 $ 2,106,667 64,658 4.09\nBorrowed funds 1,172,019 38,208 4.35 1,452,606 50,361 4.62\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,387,738 88,826 3.50 3,559,273 115,019 4.30\nDemand deposits 367,541 349,545\nOther liabilities 11,362 14,780\nTotal liabilities 3,766,641 3,923,598\nStockholders’ equity 399,293 418,995\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,165,934 $ 4,342,593\nNet interest income $ 38,927 $ 30,933\nWeighted average spread 0.65 % 0.25 %\nNet interest margin (6) 1.26 % 0.96 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to average\ninterest-bearing liabilities (7) 121.28 % 120.14 %\n(1) Before allowance for credit losses.\n(2) Includes average non-accrual loans.\n(3) Excludes the impact of the average net unrealized gain or loss on securities.\n(4) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock.\n(5) Includes mortgagors' escrow accounts.\n(6) Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n(7) Total interest-earning assets divided by total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(8) Average balances are calculated on a daily basis.\n(9) Annualized.

The Bank determined that a $545,000 adjustment to increase the allowance\nfor credit losses and no reserve for unfunded commitments was required upon adoption. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying interim\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 1. “Financial Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nAt September 30, 2024, management's review of the allowance for credit losses concluded that a balance of $27.0 million was\nadequate to provide for losses based upon evaluation of risk in the loan portfolio. During the first nine months of 2024, management\nprovided $328,000 to achieve such an allowance for credit loss balance at September 30, 2024. Comparably, for the nine months\nended September 30,2023, management’s evaluation of the balance of the allowance for credit losses indicated the need for a\nprovision of $847,000. Credit quality remained strong with no delinquent or non performing commercial real estate loans as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The Bank did not record any charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023.\nSee Notes 1 and 6 to the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and “Loans and Foreclosed Real Estate”\nincluded in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information pertaining to the allowance for credit losses.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of gain on equity securities, net, customer service fees on deposits, increases in the cash surrender\nvalue of bank-owned life insurance policies, gain on disposal of fixed assets, and miscellaneous income. Total other income was\n$12.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to other income of $10.3 million for the same period in 2023. In the first\nnine months of 2024, the Bank recorded gains totaling $11.9 million on equity securities, including $11.8 million of unrealized gains\non equity securities held at the end of the period and $45,000 of gains recognized on equity securities sold during the period. In the\nfirst nine months of 2023, the Bank recorded gains totaling $9.5 million on equity securities, including $9.5 million of unrealized\ngains on equity securities held at the end of the period and $119,000 of losses recognized on equity securities sold during the period.\nCustomer service fees on deposits were stable in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In recent\nyears, there has been a continuous decline in deposit account transaction fees, as the Bank has eliminated many fees on deposit\nproducts to simplify offerings and enhance the value proposition of our consumer and business checking accounts to customers. This\ntrend has ended as the Bank has eliminated the majority of these fees. Generally, the Bank’s strategy does not rely on generating\nsubstantial non-interest fee-based revenue from our deposit accounts.\nAn increase in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance also contributed to other income during the first nine months\nof 2024 and 2023. The Bank held $13.9 million in life insurance policies at September 30, 2024 as compared to $13.6 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. Income from these\nassets is fully excludable from federal income taxes and contributed $257,000 to other income in the first nine months of 2024, as\ncompared to $250,000 for the same period in 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, deposit insurance,\nmarketing, foreclosure and related, and other general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses were $21.8 million, or an\nannualized 0.67% of average total assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $21.3 million, or an\nannualized 0.68% of average total assets, for the same period of 2023.\nSalaries and employee benefits expenses increased by $208,000, or 2%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\n29\nto the same period in 2023, primarily due to annual merit-based salary increases, enhancements to our operational teams and higher\npayroll taxes, partially offset by reductions in executive pay implemented during 2023. The number of employees remained relatively\nstable, reflecting additional staff in our SDG and operational teams, partially offset by a smaller branch staff.\nOccupancy and equipment expenses increased by $27,000, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher depreciation expenses, as the Bank made improvements to the corporate\noffices, which were completed in the second half of 2023, partially offset by lower maintenance expenses. Lower rental income\nrecorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also contributed to the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses. The\nBank owns rental apartments located above its Nantucket branch which are rented during the summer season.\nData processing expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased by $144,000, or 7%, when compared to the same period in\n2023, driven primarily by higher data processing charges associated with improvements made to the Bank's systems and volume\nincreases in 2024. Technology spending at the Bank remains focused on three primary objectives: delivering new or improved\ncustomer experience, reducing costs through simplification and automation of internal processes, and securing customer and Bank\nconfidential information.\nDeposit insurance expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased by $466,000 or 24%, when compared to the same period in\n2023. The increase was the result of a higher assessed rate, combined with a larger assessment base, driven by the Bank’s balance\nsheet growth. Deposit insurance expense consists of premiums paid to the FDIC and the DIF. The FDIC assessment rate is determined\nbased on several factors, including capitalization, asset growth, earnings, use of brokered deposits and level of non-performing assets,\namong others, and is calculated on an assessment base that takes into consideration the Bank’s average total assets and average\ntangible equity, among other factors. The DIF assessment rate is based on an institution’s risk category, which is defined based on\nsimilar factors. Effective the first quarterly assessment period of 2023, the FDIC implemented a system-wide increase that applied to\nall banks, which increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate by 2 basis points. This is part of a long-planned effort by\nthe FDIC to return the funded status of the FDIC insurance fund to a higher level. The Bank carefully manages its balance sheet to\ncontrol the deposit insurance expense associated with excess liquidity while optimizing its funding mix.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $224,000, or 35%, for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as\nthe Bank continues to carefully manage these expenses focusing on business development for the Bank’s Commercial Real Estate\nGroup and SDG. The Bank continued to shift its marketing spending during the first nine months of 2024 towards supporting its\ncommercial deposit acquisition activities in the WMA and the SFBA.\nForeclosure and related expenses include expenses associated with the collection and foreclosure process, such as legal, tax,\nappraisal, insurance and other related foreclosure expenses. These expenses may be recovered when the loan returns to performing\nstatus or when the Bank exercises its remedies, as they are generally secured by the Bank’s mortgages. Such recoveries, if any, are\nreflected in future periods as contra-expense. The Bank recorded $61,000 in foreclosure and related expenses in the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as compared to a $19,000 credit in the same period in 2023. The credit in the prior year was attributed to\nthe recovery of expenses in connection with the resolution of certain non-performing loans, including an $85,000 gain on disposal\nrecorded on the sale of a foreclosed property. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Bank did not\nown any foreclosed property.\nOther general and administrative expenses, which include director fees, supplies, deposit related losses and audit-related\nexpenses, among others, decreased by $214,000, or 7%, when comparing the two periods, reflecting lower miscellaneous expenses,\nincluding legal fees, loan related expenses, debit card reissuance, deposit/debit card related losses and travel expenses associated with\nthe Bank’s operations in the WMA and SFBA, partially offset by higher audit audit-related expenses. In addition, in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, the Bank incurred loan real estate tax related penalties that were refunded to the Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Bank recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established\nfor the temporary difference between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Bank's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates\nexpected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. The Bank's deferred tax asset\nis reviewed quarterly by management as to the realizability of such asset.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, the Bank recorded $4.7 million, or 21.7% of pre-tax income, in tax expense as compared to\n$7.0 million, or 25.8%, for the same quarter in 2023. The lower effective tax rate was the result of $465,000 of stock options excess\ntax benefit and the revision of income tax estimates recorded in the first nine months of 2024, combined with higher unrealized gains\non equity securities recognized during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, as these\nsecurities are held at a tax-advantaged subsidiary. The Bank recognized $166,000 on the exercise of stock options during the first nine\nmonths of 2023.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nCOMPARISON AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 TO DECEMBER 31, 2023\nAssets totaled $4.450 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $4.484 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $34.2\nmillion, or 1% annualized. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank continued to manage the balance of excess reserves held at\nthe FRBB, in order to minimize the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity.\n30\nSecurities, Short-term Investments and FHLB Stock\nSecurities were $104.1 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $20.8 million when compared to $83.3 million at December\n31, 2023, reflecting an increase in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio and a $3.0 million increase in debt securities held to\nmaturity. The fair value of equity securities fluctuates with the performance of equity markets.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank held a $3.5 million investment in the subordinated debt issued by a\nbank holding company in which the Bank also maintains an equity investment. The balance at September 30, 2024 included\nadditional investments made in the senior notes and subordinated debt of other financial institutions during 2024. These investments\nare included in securities held to maturity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent permissible under Massachusetts law, the\nBank decides whether to hold these securities at the Bank or in a tax-advantaged subsidiary in order to reduce taxable income.\nAt September 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for approximately 94% of the investment portfolio. At September 30, 2024,\nthe Bank held a $9.0 million investment in the CRA Fund, a mutual fund which invests in securities which qualify under the CRA\nsecurities test. Additionally, the portfolio included $88.6 million in marketable common equity securities. This compares to a $8.9\nmillion investment in the CRA Fund and a $70.9 million investment in marketable equity securities at December 31, 2023. The\nBank’s marketable common equity securities are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior returns on\ncapital over a longer time horizon. The Bank’s process is focused on identifying businesses with strong returns on capital,\nowner-oriented management teams, good reinvestment opportunities or capital discipline, and reasonable valuations. The portfolio is\nconcentrated in a relatively small number of investments in the financial services and technology areas.\nA breakdown of the marketable equity securities portfolio per industry follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nPayments $ 22,608 32 % $ 24,747 28 %\nTechnology 19,026 27 23,459 26\nInsurance 15,869 22 20,460 23\nBanking 8,285 12 13,844 16\nCredit Ratings/Data 5,161 7 6,094 7\nTotal $ 70,949 100 % $ 88,604 100 %\nThe Bank receives two sources of advantageous tax treatment through these investments. First, dividend distributions from these\ncompanies to the Bank are partially excluded from the Bank’s taxable income due to the Dividends Received Deduction. Second, to\nthe extent that these companies are capable of internal reinvestment at high rates of return or deploy capital via tax-advantaged\nrepurchases, the deferred tax liability associated with any long-term unrealized gains on our investments constitutes an interest-free\nsource of financing.\nAs a member of the FHLB of Boston, the Bank is required to hold a Membership Stock Investment plus an Activity-based Stock\nInvestment in the FHLB, which is based primarily on the amount of FHLB borrowings. The Bank recorded dividends on FHLB stock\ntotaling $1.3 million and $3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $995,000 and $2.6\nmillion for the same periods in 2023. These increases reflected the dividend rate increase implemented by the FHLB, as well as a\nhigher average balance of FHLB stock. At September 30, 2024, the Bank held $62.8 million in FHLB stock compared to $69.6\nmillion at December 31, 2023.\nLoans and Foreclosed Real Estate\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, net loans outstanding decreased by $51.1 million to $3.863 billion, from $3.914 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, attributable primarily to payoffs and amortization - including turnover in the Bank’s construction loan portfolio,\npartially offset by originated loans of $195.3 million during the period. Comparably, loan originations for the same period in 2023\nwere $324.5 million. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net loans outstanding represented 87% of assets.\nMortgage loans continue to account for more than 99% of the loan portfolio.\nA breakdown of the originated loan by geography follows:\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMassachusetts $ 190,463 59 % $ 139,676 71 %\nWashington Metropolitan Area 129,089 40 50,418 26\nSan Francisco Bay Area 4,900 1 5,200 3\nTotal $ 324,452 100 % $ 195,294 100 %\n31\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank had $1.194 billion and $122.5 million, respectively, of commercial real estate loans originated\nin the WMA and the SFBA outstanding (including construction loans). At December 31, 2023, the Bank had $1.199 billion and\n$118.5 million, respectively, of loans originated in the WMA and the SFBA outstanding.\nWMA: The Bank began lending to commercial real estate borrowers in the WMA in November 2016, after several years of\nresearch and preparation. The Bank had also held direct equity investments in other WMA area banks prior to entering the market\noperationally. In 2019, the Bank opened a commercial lending office at a temporary location and hired a commercial real estate\nlender. In February 2020, the Bank acquired a property in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., renovated the property,\nand opened a commercial banking office in 2022. The Bank obtained regulatory approval to exercise branch powers at this office in\n2023. The Bank has a senior commercial real estate lender based in the WMA, along with two relationship managers from the Bank’s\nSDG. When needed, the Bank also utilizes Boston-based staff in its Commercial Real Estate Group and SDG with experience in the\nWMA, on a fly-away basis from its main office.\nThe Bank originally identified the WMA as an attractive opportunity for three reasons. First, the region has favorable economic\ncharacteristics that will support long-term investments in commercial real estate. It is the capital of the world’s largest economy, it is\nan international economic gateway, it has one of the highest household median income of any of the nation’s major metropolitan areas,\nand it has a relatively high concentration of young people. Second, the commercial real estate product in the market bears significant\nsimilarity to Boston, characterized by high density, urban infill development, transit-oriented multifamily, and scarcity imposed by\nland supply and restrictions on vertical development. Third, we believe that the banking market in Washington, D.C. has experienced\na level of consolidation and disruption that has left smaller and mid-sized real estate investors underserved as compared to the Boston\nmarket. Although we are relatively new to this marketplace, we believe that our history as one of America’s oldest banks and our\nfamily management team provide stability and surety of execution that is valued by our customers. With over five years of operation\nin the market, we have gained increasing confidence in this thesis. We view this as an attractive opportunity for internal capital\nallocation and superior to geographically proximate, product-adjacent businesses like wealth management, insurance, or\ncommercial-industrial lending in our home marketplace. The Bank did not initially make commercial construction loans in this\nmarket, as these loans have a higher level of inherent risk. As the Bank developed greater familiarity with the market and the portfolio\ngrew, the Bank made the investment in the operational capacity to originate and manage such loans in the WMA and the Bank now\noriginates the full range of commercial mortgages in Washington. For similar reasons, the Bank also delayed originating residential\nowner occupant loans in the WMA, but as the Bank’s customer base has grown, the Bank has seen significant demand for this service.\nIn 2023, the Bank began offering such loans to existing commercial and private clients of the Bank in the WMA.\nSFBA: The San Francisco Bay Area is the Bank’s newest and smallest market, having begun operations in 2021 with a focus on\ncommercial real estate customers and commercial and nonprofit deposit relationships. The Bank relies to a large extent on Boston and\nWMA-based staff to cover the initial operations in this market. The Bank hired a deposit-focused relationship manager in San\nFrancisco to join the SDG and is actively looking to hire a dedicated commercial real estate lender in this market. The Bank does not\nhave a retail branch in this market. The Bank built the operational framework for originating commercial real estate loans in the\nSFBA and began engaging with prospective customers in 2021. The Bank closed its first loan in the SFBA in the fourth quarter of\n2021 and continued to originate loans in 2022, and to a lesser extent, in 2023 and 2024.\nThis initiative builds on several years of research and direct equity investments that provided the Bank with exposure and insight\ninto the SFBA real estate and banking markets, but the Bank’s long-term plans were accelerated to capitalize the pandemic-related\ndisruption in those markets. The Bank continues to believe that the most attractive markets for its business are coastal, urban, gateway\ncities with substantial wealth, favorable demographics, substantial multifamily real estate, and consolidation among small and\nmid-sized banks. This initiative has initially focused on both investor and owner-occupied commercial real estate and multifamily\nproperties. The Bank does not yet originate commercial construction or owner-occupied residential loans in the SFBA.\nOriginations in the SFBA have been materially lower recently when compared to the WMA and Boston markets. This is largely\nthe product of the changes in market conditions in 2023 and 2024 to date in the SFBA market, as opposed to a deliberate choice by the\nBank to alter its approach to the marketplace. There were some SFBA market-specific conditions in 2023, including disruption in the\nlocal banking market and several well-publicized portfolios of distressed multifamily properties, that appear to have had a differential\nimpact on the SFBA multifamily market. The Bank continues to engage actively with prospective customers in the SFBA for both\nlending and deposit opportunities.\nAll WMA and SFBA underwriting and approval processes are identical to those utilized in the Boston marketplace and all loans\nare reviewed and approved by the Bank’s Executive Committee and when larger than $2.0 million, by the Bank’s full Board of\nDirectors. A member of the Executive Committee performs a site visit for every collateral property. The Bank has retained local\ncounsel in both markets to advise on all of its transactional needs, with oversight on each individual transaction by the Bank’s primary\nreal estate counsel in Boston. The Bank uses the same consulting firm in Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco for\nenvironmental assessments and property condition reports to ensure quality of execution and manage risk. This firm also performs\nseismic risk assessments in San Francisco for the Bank. The Bank generally requires that all third-party assessments are conducted by\nthe Bank’s consultants and will not generally accept reports ordered separately by a borrower. Once closed, these loans are subject to\nall of the Bank’s regular quality control and portfolio management processes.\nThe Bank approaches prospective borrowers directly via advertising programs, and indirectly via intermediaries such as attorneys,\naccountants and mortgage brokers. The Bank also has existing Boston-based customers with real estate investment holdings in both\n32\nthe Massachusetts and the WMA or SFBA markets.\nCommercial real estate loans by collateral type at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 , are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 September 30, 2024\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nMultifamily (5+) $ 1,077,174 34 % $ 1,128,426 35 %\nResidential (1-4) 481,014 15 483,951 15\nOffice 508,397 16 451,861 14\nMixed use 524,657 17 556,977 18\nRetail 300,429 10 302,675 10\nIndustrial 133,863 4 131,267 4\nLand 59,508 2 59,658 2\nOthers 70,242 2 63,972 2\nTotal $ 3,155,284 100 % $ 3,178,787 100 %\nMixed-use properties generally consist of urban properties which combine a substantial multifamily use with street level retail or\noffice uses.\nLoans are carried net of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is maintained at a level to absorb losses within the loan\nportfolio. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses had a balance of $27.0 million, as compared to $26.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.69% of gross loans at September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.68%\nat December 31, 2023.\nThe Bank’s non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and foreclosed real estate. At September 30, 2024, there were\neight residential loans classified as non-accrual totaling $1.6 million as compared to five non-accrual loans totaling $1.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, non-performing assets were 0.04% of total assets, as compared to 0.03% at December\n31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no foreclosed assets. The Bank works closely with\ndelinquent mortgagors to bring their loans current and commences foreclosure proceedings if the mortgagor is unable to satisfy their\noutstanding obligation. Although regulatory changes have slowed the foreclosure process in recent years, the Bank continues to pursue\ndelinquencies vigorously.\nManagement believes that its loans classified as non-accrual are significantly collateralized, pose minimal risk of loss to the Bank,\nand the allowance for credit losses allocated to these loans is sufficient to absorb such losses, if any. However, management continues\nto monitor the loan portfolio and additional reserves will be recorded if necessary.\nBelow is a summary of non-performing assets:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2024\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-accrual loans:\nResidential real estate $ 877 $ 1,025\nCommercial real estate — —\nHome equity 602 599\nTotal non-accrual loans 1,479 1,624\nForeclosed real estate — —\nTotal non-performing assets $ 1,479 $ 1,624\nPercent of non-accrual loans to:\nTotal loans 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nPercent of non-performing assets to:\nTotal loans and foreclosed real estate 0.04 % 0.04 %\nTotal assets 0.03 % 0.04 %\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 0.68 % 0.69 %\nOther Assets\nThe Bank held $13.9 million in bank-owned life insurance at September 30, 2024, as compared to $13.6 million at December 31,\n2023. The $257,000 increase during the first nine months of 2024 is due to increases in the cash surrender value of policies insuring\nthe life of a current Bank executive. The policies accrete at a variable rate of interest with minimum stated guaranteed rates. The\n33\nBank monitors the financial strength and counterparty credit ratings of the policy issuers and has determined that at September 30,\n2024, one of three issuers was rated at or above Bank guidelines. Of the other two issuers, one retained a rating from A.M. Best two\nnotches below Bank guidelines at B++ , while the other retained a rating from Moody’s and Fitch two and one notches below Bank\nguidelines at Baa1 and A-, respectively (with a stable outlook).\nAs of September 30, 2024, the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability related to operating leases for two of the Bank’s\nbanking offices was $206,000 and $224,000, respectively. The right-of-use asset is included in other assets and the lease liability is\nincluded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank holds a $2.4 million investment in the common stock of Founders Bank, a de novo bank in\nWashington, D.C. This balance includes a $2.3 million initial investment in common stock and related unrealized gains.\nAs of September 30, 2024, other assets included a $741,000 investment in the Washington Housing Initiative, a CRA investment\nvehicle that provides low cost loans to acquire and develop affordable workforce housing in Washington D.C. and a $5.0 million\ninvestment in the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, a CRA investment vehicle that provides low cost loans to acquire and\ndevelop affordable workforce housing in San Francisco.\nDeposits\nDeposits increased by $111.2 million to $2.461 billion at September 30, 2024, from $2.350 billion at December 31, 2023.\nNon-certificate accounts, which include regular, money market, NOW and demand deposits, increased by $110.8 million from\nDecember 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, while certificate balances increased by $329,000. The increase in non-certificate accounts\nwas driven by money market, NOW and demand deposit accounts, as the Bank continued to focus on developing and deepening\ndeposit relationships with new and existing commercial and non-profit customers. The increase in certificate account balances\nprimarily reflects a $4.8 million increase in retail and commercial time deposits, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in\nwholesale time deposits, which includes both brokered and Internet listing services time deposits. Non-certificate accounts represent\n51.5% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, as compared to 49.2% at December 31, 2023.\nOther banks and credit unions in the Bank's market areas, banking services through the Internet, and mutual funds make up the\nBank’s primary competition for deposits. At times, the Bank also faces direct and indirect competition from fixed income securities\nsuch as U.S Treasury bills or non-bank financial services companies with access to the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse\nRepurchase Facility. The Bank's ability to attract and retain deposits depends upon satisfaction of depositors' requirements with\nrespect to insurance, product, rate and service. The Bank offers traditional deposit products, competitive rates, convenient branch\nlocations, ATMs, debit cards and Internet-based banking for consumers and commercial account holders. The Bank also opens deposit\naccounts, including checking accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, directly online for personal customers.\nOccasionally, the Bank implements special offerings based on market conditions and the competitive environment. The Bank also\noffers a limited range of certificate of deposit products using national Internet listing services and brokered deposits. These\nalternatives, at times, provide the Bank with a source of funding across different maturities at lower cost and/or longer duration than\nmay be available via retail or other wholesale channels. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $484.2 million in deposits from these\nsources, as compared to $488.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank carefully manages its wholesale funding mix allocation\nbased on market conditions to reduce the Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities and minimize the negative effect of elevated\nshort-term rates on the Bank’s net interest margin. In doing this, the Bank takes into consideration each funding source’s interest rate,\nbroker commission and FDIC insurance assessment implications (as applicable), speed of execution as well as the operational\ncharacteristics. This approach has allowed the Bank to maintain deposit balances to fund lending activity and operate with an elevated\nlevel of on and off-balance sheet liquidity.\nDeposits are insured in full through the combination of the FDIC and the DIF. Generally, separately insured deposit accounts are\ninsured up to $250,000 by the FDIC and deposit balances in excess of this amount are insured by the DIF. DIF insurance provides an\nadvantage for the Bank as some competitors cannot offer this coverage.\nBelow is a summary of deposits:\nDeposit Balances by Type\nDecember 31, % of September 30, % of\n2023 Total 2024 Total\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNon-certificate accounts\nRegular $ 82,050 3.5 % $ 74,174 3.0 %\nMoney market deposits 723,786 30.8 821,950 33.4\nNOW 11,425 0.5 13,013 0.5\nDemand 339,059 14.4 358,009 14.6\nTotal non-certificate accounts 1,156,320 49.2 1,267,146 51.5\nTerm certificates of less than $250,000 836,382 35.6 818,324 33.2\nTerm certificates of $250,000 or more 357,275 15.2 375,662 15.3\nTotal certificate accounts 1,193,657 50.8 1,193,986 48.5\nTotal deposits $ 2,349,977 100.0 % $ 2,461,132 100.0 %\n34\nBorrowings\nFHLB advances were $1.531 billion, or 34% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.693 billion, or 38% of total\nassets, at December 31, 2023. The Bank continued to manage its wholesale funding mix opportunistically during the first nine months\nof 2024. During this period, borrowings decreased by $162.2 million, as the Bank experienced growth in retail and commercial\ndeposits while the loan portfolio decreased. In late 2023 and 2024, the Bank began to gradually extend the duration of its FHLB\nClassic Advances to capture the benefit of the FHLB curve inversion and, to a lesser extent, protect against a higher-for-longer or a\nslower - than market expectations - pace of decline in short-term market rates. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the Bank had\n$785.0 million in FHLB HLB-Option Advances outstanding. These are 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, and to a lesser extent 6-year and 7-year\nmaturity fixed rate advances callable quarterly by the FHLB after an initial lockout period of three months, which provide the Bank\nwith a lower fixed rate in exchange for the call option granted to the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $30.0 million,\n$335.0 million, $375.0 million and $45.0 million in HLB-Option Advances outstanding, with original maturities in 2027, 2028, 2029\nand 2030, respectively, all of which were past their lockout periods and were callable by the FHLB in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to ensure the Bank has sufficient liquidity to fund its lending operations, off-balance sheet commitments and contractual\nobligations, the Bank maintains an adequate level of readily available liquidity, both on and off-balance sheet.\nThe Bank also assesses its liquidity position regularly by forecasting incoming and outgoing cash flows. In some cases,\ncontractual maturity dates are used to anticipate cash flows. However, when an asset or liability has no contractual maturity, or is\nsubject to early repayment or redemption at the discretion of the issuer or customer, cash flows can be difficult to predict. Generally,\nthese rights are exercised when it is most financially favorable to the issuer or customer.\nMarketable common equity holdings, although liquid, are not viewed as a source of liquidity and are managed to produce superior\nreturns on capital over a longer time horizon.\nInvestment in FHLB stock is illiquid.\nResidential loans are susceptible to principal repayment at the discretion of the borrower. Commercial mortgage loans, while\nsubject to significant penalties for early repayment in most cases, can also prepay at the borrower’s discretion. In the first nine months\nof 2024, prepayment rates were higher when compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe Bank invests in key executive life insurance policies that are illiquid during the life of the executive. Such policies totaled\n$13.9 million, or less than 1% of total assets, at September 30, 2024.\nNon-certificate deposit balances can generally be withdrawn from the Bank at any time. The Bank estimates the volatility of its\ndeposits in light of the general economic climate and recent actual experience. Over the past 10 years, deposits have exceeded\nwithdrawals resulting in net cash inflows from depositors.\nTime certificates of deposit, which have predefined maturity dates, have different redemption characteristics based on their nature.\nRetail certificates of deposit, subject to early redemption penalties, can be withdrawn subject to the discretion of the Bank. Internet\nlisting service certificates are offered on the same terms as retail certificates, although the Bank generally does not permit early\nwithdrawal. Brokered certificates generally may not be withdrawn before the stated maturity. The Bank had $1.194 billion in time\ndeposits outstanding at September 30, 2024, of which $1.167 billion have a contractual maturity within one year.\nAt September 30, 2024, $745.5 million of the Bank’s borrowings were fixed in terms of maturity and $785.0 million can be called\nquarterly by the FHLB during the fourth quarter of 2024. The Bank had no amortizing advances as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank also monitors its off-balance sheet items. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately $331.7 million in\ncommitments to extend credit, as compared to $357.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank also has commitments for data\nprocessing agreements totaling $7.0 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank takes each of these preceding issues into consideration when measuring its liquidity position. Specific measurements\ninclude the Bank’s cash flow position from the 30-day to 365-day horizon, the level of price-sensitive liabilities to earning assets and\nloan to deposit ratios. Additionally, the Bank “shocks” its cash flows by assuming significant cash outflows in both non-certificate\nand certificate deposit balances. At September 30, 2024, each measurement was within predefined Bank guidelines, with the\nexception of the loan to deposit ratio and the dependency ratio, which were above the guidelines. The loan to deposit ratio has\nincreased in recent years driven primarily by the significant growth in the loan portfolio in 2022, and to a lesser extent in 2023, and the\nmodest deposit growth by comparison. This ratio has also been impacted by the Bank’s allocation of the wholesale funding mix\nbetween wholesale deposits and borrowings - particularly by management’s deliberate efforts to replace maturing Internet listing\nservices time deposits with lower rate FHLB advances during the recent cycle. The dependency ratio is an internal Bank defined\nmeasure of the share of longer term assets funded with potentially price-sensitive liabilities and, at September 30, 2024, was above the\nBank’s guideline driven by the same factors described above. The Bank’s calculation of the dependency ratio generally treats some\nportion of certificates of deposit as being potentially price sensitive, whereas it does not treat money market funds in the same way.\nConsequently, the migration of deposits from money market accounts to certificates of deposit has also contributed to an increase in\nthe dependency ratio. The Bank continues to carefully manage loan growth and focusing on gathering retail and commercial deposits,\nwhile maintaining significant on and off-balance sheet liquidity.\nThe Bank’s initial source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents which were $368.1 million, or 8% of total assets, at September\n35\n30, 2024. Virtually all cash and cash equivalents are held in overnight cash balances at the FRBB, which are immediately accessible\nfor liquidity. The Bank carefully monitors these overnight cash balances to minimize the carrying cost of on-balance sheet liquidity.\nTo supplement its liquidity position, should the need arise, the Bank maintains its membership in the FHLB where it is eligible to\nobtain both short and long-term credit advances and is eligible to access the FRBB discount window. The FHLB does not accept\ncertain types of real estate loans and establishes certain limits on borrowing activity, including a limitation on commercial real estate\ncollateral discounted value up to two times the Bank’s GAAP shareholders’ equity and an overall limit of total extension of credit up\nto 40% of the Bank’s total assets. This latter limit, which was lowered from 50% by the FHLB in early 2024, applies to all members.\nRecently, the FHLB adopted a framework that establishes this limit based upon an assessment of a member's credit category, going\nfrom 40% for members in category “1” to 5% for members in category “4”. This dual relationship with the FHLB and FRBB provides\nthe Bank with the flexibility to maximize available capacity and to access immediately available liquidity using the FRBB discount\nwindow if the FHLB was unavailable to provide liquidity or were to establish more stringent limits in the future. The Bank actively\npledges new collateral as loans are originated and manages the collateral allocation between the FHLB and the FRBB to maximize\nborrowing capacity. In aggregate, the Bank had available borrowing capacity of $815.5 million from these sources at September 30,\n2024, as compared to $598.9 million at December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to approximately $1.840 billion from the FHLB to meet its borrowing needs,\nbased on the Bank's available qualified collateral which consists primarily of one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, certain\nmultifamily residential property and commercial mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $1.531 billion in advances\noutstanding from the FHLB and had $304.8 million in available unused capacity (net of accrued interest on outstanding advances).\nThis compares to an unused capacity of $355.1 million at December 31, 2023. The FHLB unused capacity decreased in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 as a result of a decrease of $212.5 million in gross FHLB capacity during this period, partially offset by a $162.2\nmillion decrease in outstanding advances. The decline in gross FHLB capacity was primarily a result of the adoption of the 40% cap\ndiscussed above, which resulted in the Bank transferring collateral to the FRBB in the first nine months of 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank can borrow up to $510.7 million by accessing the FRBB Discount Window, based on the Bank's\navailable qualified collateral which consists primarily of HELOCs, one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, multifamily\nresidential property, construction and commercial mortgage loans. The Bank initially obtained approval to pledge HELOCs, and in\n2023, obtained approval and began pledging commercial and residential real estate loans. In the first quarter of 2024, the Bank\nobtained approval to pledge additional loans to the FRBB in anticipation of the FHLB 40% cap adoption, and transferred collateral\nfrom the FHLB to the FRBB. At September 30, 2024 the Bank did not have any advances outstanding at the FRBB and had $510.7\nmillion in available unused capacity.\nThe Bank obtains the necessary capital to support its current and future requirements from the retained earnings generated though\nits operations.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Bank had capital of $421.7 million, or 9.5% of total assets, as compared to $407.6 million, or 9.1%\nof total assets, at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stockholders' equity increased by $14.1\nmillion due primarily to net income for the period of $16.8 million and $1.3 million additional capital from stocks options exercised,\npartially offset by the declaration of dividends of $1.89 per share, which reduced capital by $4.1 million.\nThe Bank is subject to minimum capital maintenance requirements. Regulatory guidelines define the minimum amount of\nqualifying capital an institution must maintain as a percentage of risk-weighted assets and average total assets. The Bank's ratios\nexceeded these regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following table details the Bank’s actual capital ratios and minimum regulatory ratios as of December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nMinimum Minimum To Be Well\nCapital Capitalized Under Prompt\nActual Requirement* Corrective Actions Provisions\nAmounts Ratio Amounts Ratio Amounts Ratio\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 434,272 13.17 % $ 346,214 10.50 % $ 329,728 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 407,620 12.36 230,810 7.00 214,323 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 407,620 12.36 280,269 8.50 263,782 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 407,620 9.52 171,297 4.00 214,121 5.00\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 448,682 13.97 % $ 337,169 10.50 % $ 321,113 10.00 %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-\nWeighted Assets 421,702 13.13 224,779 7.00 208,724 6.50\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 421,702 13.13 272,946 8.50 256,890 8.00\nTier 1 Capital to Average Assets 421,702 9.77 172,611 4.00 215,764 5.00\n* Minimum risk-based regulatory capital ratios and amounts at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 include the applicable minimum\nrisk-based capital ratios and capital conservation buffer of 2.5%\n36\nItem 3 – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe earnings of most banking institutions are exposed to interest rate risk because their balance sheets, both assets and liabilities,\nare predominantly interest-bearing. It is the Bank's objective to maximize the Bank’s net interest income through the cycle while\nminimizing, to the degree prudently possible, its exposure to interest rate risk, bearing in mind that the Bank, by its very nature, will\nalways be in the business of taking on interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Asset Liability\nCommittee (the “ALCO”) and Board of Directors of the Bank. The ALCO is composed of members of Bank Management and the\nExecutive Committee of the Board. The ALCO establishes and monitors the various components of the balance sheet including\nvolume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets along with funding sources. The goal is to balance liquidity, interest rate risk and\nprofitability. The primary tool used in managing interest rate risk is income simulation modeling. Income simulation modeling\nmeasures changes in net interest income by projecting the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet and applying different\ninterest rate scenarios. Management incorporates numerous assumptions into the simulation model, such as asset prepayment speeds,\nbalance sheet growth and non-maturity deposits elasticity. Management believes that there have been no material changes in the\ninterest rate risk reported in the Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The information is contained in the Form 10-K within the section “Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nItem 4 – Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Bank’s management, including the Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the Bank’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit\nrelationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nat the reasonable assurance level.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control\nThere were no significant changes in the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e), during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nBank’s internal control over financial reporting.\n37\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 – Legal Proceedings\nThe Bank is involved, from time to time, as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business and\ntypically related to loan collection activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was not involved in any material legal proceedings\nthe outcome of which, if determined in a manner adverse to the Bank, would have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nThere have generally been no material changes to the nature of the risk factors previously disclosed in the Bank’s most recent Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the FDIC.\nItem 2 – Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3 – Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4 – Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5 – Other Information\nNone.\nItem 6 – Exhibits\nExhibit No.\n31.1 Certifications – Chief Executive Officer\n31.2 Certifications – Chief Financial Officer\n32.1 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Executive Officer\n32.2 Certification Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1350 – Chief Financial Officer\n38\nsignatures\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its\nbehalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.\nHINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS\nDate: November 6, 2024 /s/\nRobert H.

Enclosed is a\nform of proxy for the Meeting (and any adjournment or postponement thereof). This Proxy Statement and the\nenclosed form of proxy are furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of\nthe Bank (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”), and are first being sent to stockholders on or about March\n11, 2024.\nPROXY SUMMARY\nDate, Time and Place of Annual Meeting\nThe Meeting will be held at the Old Derby Academy at 34 Main Street, Hingham, Massachusetts 02043,\non Thursday, April 25, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. local time. Stockholders may also join the Meeting by means of\nremote communication via a video conference; however, voting will only take place in person or via proxy. The\nBank reserves the right to reconsider the format of the meeting so that it is conducted in the best interests of\npublic health and any laws or governmental orders in place on the meeting date.\nFollowing the formal meeting, we plan to conduct an informal meeting in person and via video\nconference to review the performance of the Bank and conduct a question-and-answer session. Additional\ninformation regarding the Meeting, including instructions for registration and attendance, will be provided on\nthe Investor Materials page of the Bank’s website, www.hinghamsavings.com/investor-materials . Voting will\nonly take place in person or via proxy.\nPurpose of the Annual Meeting\nThe purpose of the Meeting is: (1) to elect five Class III Directors of the Bank to serve until the 2027\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders, and until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified; (2) to\nelect a Clerk of the Bank to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until her successor is\nduly elected and qualified; (3) to approve, by advisory vote, the Bank’s named executive officer compensation;\n(4) to ratify, by advisory vote, the appointment of Wolf & Company, P.C. as the Bank’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024; and (5) to transact such other business as\nmay properly come before the Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.\nRecord Date\nThe Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 1, 2024 as the record date for the\ndetermination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting or any adjournments or\npostponements thereof. Only holders of record of the Bank’s common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the\n5\n“Common Stock”) at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the\nMeeting or any adjournments thereof. At the close of business on the record date, there were 2,170,400 shares\nof the Bank’s Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to\none vote.\nQuorum\nThe presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in interest of all Common Stock issued,\noutstanding and entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the\nMeeting. As of February 1, 2024, the Directors and executive officers of the Bank owned in the aggregate\napproximately 28% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock which may be voted at the Meeting.\nBroker Non-Votes\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares held in a brokerage account and you do not instruct your broker,\nbank or other agent how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other agent may still be able to vote your\nshares at its discretion. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (which in this matter also\napply with respect to Nasdaq listed companies such as the Bank), brokers, banks and agents may use their\ndiscretion to vote your shares on matters considered to be “routine” under NYSE rules, but not with respect to\n“non-routine” matters. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other agent has not received voting\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and the broker, bank, or other agent cannot vote the shares\nbecause the matter is considered “non-routine” under NYSE rules. Proposals 1, 2 and 3 are considered to be\n“non-routine” under NYSE rules such that your broker, bank or other agent may not vote your shares on those\nproposals in the absence of your voting instructions. Proposal 4 is considered to be a “routine” matter under\nNYSE rules so that if you do not return voting instructions to your broker by its deadline, your shares may be\nvoted by your broker in its discretion on Proposal 4.\nRequired Stockholder Vote\nThe five Class III Directors and the Clerk will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Abstentions,\nbroker non-votes and votes withheld will have no effect on the outcome of the election of Directors and the\nClerk. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting on such matter is necessary to\nadopt the advisory votes on the Bank’s named executive officer compensation and the ratification of Wolf &\nCompany, P.C. as the Bank’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2024. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals.\nRevocation\nYour proxy may be revoked at any time before it is exercised. Any stockholder of record attending the\nMeeting may vote in person even though he or she may have previously submitted a proxy. Your proxy may be\nrevoked by written notice to the Bank prior to the Meeting, by delivering to the Bank an executed proxy bearing\na later date, or by appearing in person at the Meeting and voting by ballot. If you hold your shares in “street\nname,” you must request a proxy from your broker, board or other nominee in order to vote at the Meeting.\n6\nPROPOSALS\nProposal One: Election of Directors (Page 8)\nThe Bank’s Amended and Restated Charter and By-Laws provide that the Board of Directors shall be\ndivided into three classes, with the Directors in each class serving for a term of three years.\nAt the Meeting, stockholders of the Bank are being asked to elect five Class III Directors of the Bank to\nserve until the 2027 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.\nThe Board of Directors of the Bank has nominated Michael J. Desmond, Robert A. Lane, Esq., Scott L. Moser,\nKara Gaughen Smith and Jacqueline M. Youngworth, each of whom is currently serving as a Director of the\nBank. See “ELECTION OF DIRECTORS (Notice Item 1).”\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the election of the five\nnominees in this proposal.\nProposal Two: Election of Clerk (Page 38)\nUnder Massachusetts law, the Clerk of the Bank is to be elected by the stockholders at an annual\nmeeting or special meeting duly called for that purpose. At the Meeting, the stockholders of the Bank are being\nasked to elect Jacqueline M. Youngworth, the nominee proposed by the Board of Directors, as Clerk of the\nBank to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until her successor is elected and qualified.\nSee “ELECTION OF CLERK (Notice Item 2).”\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the election of Jacqueline M.\nYoungworth as Clerk of the Bank.\nProposal Three: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Page 38)\nThe Board of Directors is committed to excellence in governance and the development and retention of\nthe highest quality management team. At the Meeting, as part of that commitment, the Board is providing\nstockholders the opportunity to approve an advisory vote on the compensation of the Bank’s named executive\nofficers. See “ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (Notice Item 3).”\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the approval of the\ncompensation of the Bank’s named executive officers.\nProposal Four: Advisory Vote on Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Page\n39)\nThe Audit Committee of the Bank (the “Audit Committee”) has engaged Wolf & Company, P.C. as the\nBank’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. While the\nBank is not required to have stockholders ratify the selection of Wolf & Company as the Bank’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm, and this vote is advisory and non-binding, the Board considers the selection\nof the independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter and is therefore submitting the\nselection of Wolf & Company for ratification by stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. See\n“ADVISORY VOTE ON INDEPENDENT AUDIT FIRM (Notice Item 4).”\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the appointment of Wolf and\n7\nCompany as the Bank’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\nOther Business\nThe Board of Directors knows of no other business to be considered at the Meeting, and the deadline for\nstockholders to submit proposals or nominations has passed. However, if (1) other matters are properly\npresented at the Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting and (2) you have properly\nsubmitted your proxy, then the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote your shares on those matters as\ndetermined by a majority of the Board of Directors.\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n(Notice Item 1)\nThe Board of Directors currently consists of fifteen members, divided into three equal classes. Each\nnominee elected at the Meeting will serve until the 2027 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until his or her\nrespective successor is duly elected and qualified. The names of the five nominees for Class III Directors and\ncertain information received from them are set forth below.\nAll five of the nominees are currently Directors of the Bank and each nominee has consented to serve if\nelected. If any nominee shall become unable to serve for any reason, the shares represented by the enclosed\nproxy will be voted in favor of such other person as the Board of Directors may at the time recommend. The\nfollowing tables list the name of each nominee, his or her age, period of service as a Director of the Bank,\npositions with the Bank, principal occupation and other directorships held. Other than Robert H. Gaughen, Jr.,\nthe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Patrick R. Gaughen, President and Chief Operating Officer,\nnone of the Directors or nominees is or has been an employee of the Bank or any of its affiliates. In evaluating\nDirectors and nominees, the Board believes that Directors should possess substantial business or functional\nexpertise, integrity, an owner-oriented attitude, and a deep interest in the Bank’s affairs. In the judgment of the\nNominating and Personnel Committee, as well as the Board of Directors as a whole, each of the nominees\npossesses such attributes. A quorum being present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of shares is\nrequired to elect each of the nominees to serve on the Board of Directors.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the election of the five\nnominees in this proposal.\n8\nNominees for Election at the Meeting\nwith Terms Expiring at the 2027 Annual Meeting\n(Class III Directors)\nNominee’s Positions Director\nName and Age with Bank of Bank Since Principal Occupation* and Education\nMichael J.

Gaughen, President and Chief Operating Officer and a Director of the Bank, and Director\nKara Gaughen Smith are the children of Robert H. Gaughen, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\nof the Board of the Bank, and are also cousins of Director Kevin W. Gaughen, Jr., Director Robert A.\nLane and Director Julio R. Hernando. Directors Kevin W. Gaughen, Jr., Robert A. Lane and Julio R.\nHernando are cousins, and they are nephews of Robert H. Gaughen, Jr. Directors Kevin W. Gaughen,\nJr., Robert A. Lane and Julio R. Hernando are partners in the practice of law.\nThe Board of Directors has determined that Howard M. Berger, Michael J. Desmond, Ronald D.\nFalcione, Brian T. Kenner, Scott L. Moser, Stacey M. Page, Robert K. Sheridan, Geoffrey C. Wilkinson, Sr. and\nJacqueline M. Youngworth, who together constitute a majority of the full Board, are independent as that term is\n11\ndefined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the Nasdaq Listing\nRules.\nMEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS & BOARD STRUCTURE\nThe Board of Directors, which met twelve times in 2023, has four principal standing committees: the\nExecutive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Personnel Committee and the Community\nInteraction Committee. The Board meets every month to review the Bank’s performance and exposure to risk.\nAdditionally, the independent Directors conduct a quarterly meeting chaired by the Chairperson of the\nNominating and Personnel Committee, the purpose of which is to allow for discussion of items which any\nmember wishes to raise in the absence of the non-independent members.\nThe Executive Committee, composed of eight Directors, oversees the management policies and affairs\nof the Bank. This Committee met twenty-four times in 2023. The current members of the Executive\nCommittee are: Michael J. Desmond, Ronald D. Falcione, Patrick R. Gaughen, Kara Gaughen Smith, Robert H.\nGaughen, Jr., Robert A. Lane, Julio R. Hernando and Jacqueline M. Youngworth.\nThe Nominating and Personnel Committee, composed of three Directors, oversees matters pertaining to\nthe nomination of Directors and officers and other personnel and compensation matters. This Committee also\nserves as the Bank’s Compensation Committee and Stock Option Committee. A copy of the charter of the\nNominating and Personnel Committee appears on the Investor Materials page of the Bank’s website,\nwww.hinghamsavings.com / investor-materials . This Committee met two times in 2023. The current members\nof the Nominating and Personnel Committee are: Howard M. Berger, Michael J. Desmond and Jacqueline M.\nYoungworth. The Board of Directors has determined that all current members of the Nominating and Personnel\nCommittee are independent, as that term is defined by applicable Nasdaq rules. The Nominating and Personnel\nCommittee is authorized to retain attorneys, advisers, and consultants and to compensate them for their services.\nThe Nominating and Personnel Committee also makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors\nfor nominations for Directors to be elected at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders and considers stockholder\nproposals for such nominations. For information regarding procedures for submitting stockholder proposals,\nsee “STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS.”\nThe Audit Committee, composed of six Directors, approves the Bank’s annual audit, retains the Bank’s\nexternal and internal auditors and presents the audit report to the Board of Directors. A copy of the charter of\nthe Audit Committee appears on the Investor Materials page of the Bank’s website,\nwww.hinghamsavings.com / investor-materials . This Committee met four times in 2023. The Audit Committee\nmeets at least quarterly with senior management, internal auditors and loan reviewers, and also meets at least\nsemi-annually with the Bank’s independent auditors. The Committee also meets independently with the internal\nauditor, loan reviewers, and the independent auditor on a regular basis, without management present. The\ncurrent members of the Audit Committee are: Howard M. Berger, Brian T. Kenner, Scott L. Moser, Stacey M.\nPage, Robert K. Sheridan and Geoffrey C. Wilkinson, Sr. The Board of Directors has determined that all\nmembers of the Audit Committee are “independent” and “independent of management,” within the meaning of\napplicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), Nasdaq and Section 363.5 of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) regulations, and that Mr. Sheridan, an independent member of\nthe Audit Committee, is an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined by the SEC, in light of his\nexperience as the long-serving President and Chief Executive Officer of the Savings Bank Life Insurance\nCompany of Massachusetts.\nThe Community Interaction Committee, currently composed of seven Director members, formulates and\n12\nreviews Bank policies and practices relating to community reinvestment and fair lending efforts. This\nCommittee met two times in 2023 and the current members are: Ronald D. Falcione, Kevin W. Gaughen, Jr.,\nRobert H. Gaughen, Jr., Julio R. Hernando, Robert K. Sheridan, Kara Gaughen Smith and Geoffrey C.\nWilkinson, Sr.\nIn 2023, each of the Directors of the Bank attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number\nof meetings of the Board of Directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by committees thereof on\nwhich any such Director served (for such period of the year as he or she served on such committee). Pursuant\nto Bank policy, all of the Bank’s Directors are encouraged and expected to attend the Bank’s Annual Meeting of\nStockholders. All of the Bank’s Directors were in attendance at the Bank’s 2023 Annual Meeting of\nStockholders.\nThe Board of Directors believes that maintaining a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief\nExecutive Officer role is the appropriate and most effective form of Board leadership structure. Such a\nstructure provides for a focused Board effort which utilizes an involved committee structure to provide\ncomprehensive and meaningful oversight. However, the Board recognizes the critical oversight role it plays in\nthe Bank’s corporate governance. Accordingly, the Board employs three bodies – the Executive Committee, the\nAudit Committee and the full Board – to provide comprehensive and meaningful oversight. The Executive\nCommittee, which includes the Chief Executive Officer and the President, meets two times a month with senior\nmanagement to review financial information, loan proposals, overdue loans, asset liability management, and\nexposure to risk. Given the composition of this Committee, which includes the Bank’s largest stockholders, the\nfrequency of its meetings, its broad access to operational staff and risk metrics, and its broad oversight mandate,\nthe Board believes that the Executive Committee obviates the need for a (i) lead outside director and (ii) a\nseparation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles. Finally, the Board conducts executive sessions\nof independent Directors as deemed necessary from time to time and as otherwise required by the Nasdaq\nListing Rules.\nDirector Candidates and Qualifications\nStockholders of the Bank may recommend Director candidates for inclusion by the Board of Directors in\nthe slate of nominees which the Board recommends to stockholders for election. The qualifications of\nrecommended candidates will be reviewed by the Nominating and Personnel Committee (the “Committee”). If\nthe Board determines to nominate a stockholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election as\na Director to the stockholders, his or her name will be included in the Bank’s proxy card for the stockholder\nmeeting at which his or her election is recommended.\nStockholders may recommend individuals to the Committee for consideration as potential Director\ncandidates by submitting their names and background to: Jacqueline M. Youngworth, Chairman of the\nNominating and Personnel Committee, Hingham Institution for Savings, 55 Main Street, Hingham, MA 02043.\nStockholders recommending individuals for the Committee’s consideration must provide, on a timely basis, the\nbiographical and background information as requested in the Bank’s By-laws. The process followed by the\nCommittee to identify and evaluate candidates includes requests to Board members and others for\nrecommendations, meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material\nrelating to potential candidates and interviews of selected candidates by members of the Committee and the\nBoard. The Board will evaluate candidates recommended by stockholders in the same way that it evaluates all\nother candidates.\nIn considering whether to recommend any candidate for inclusion in the Board’s slate of recommended\nDirector nominees, including candidates recommended by stockholders, the Committee will apply the criteria\n13\nwhich are set forth in the Committee’s charter and otherwise consider such candidate’s qualifications and skill\nset. These criteria may include the candidate’s integrity, business acumen, experience, diligence, conflicts of\ninterest and the ability to provide a diversity of views and experience on issues under consideration and to act in\nthe interests of all stockholders. Directors at Hingham Institution for Savings must be owner-oriented. The\nCommittee and the Board of Directors believe, in general, that Directors should have a meaningful portion of\ntheir net worth invested in the Bank. The Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and\ndoes not have a formal diversity policy. No particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective\nnominees. The Bank believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the Directors, considered as a group,\nshould provide a significant and diverse mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Board to\nfulfill its responsibilities.\nThe Board does not have a mandatory retirement age for Directors and has no plans to adopt one.\nAlthough such policies are increasingly common in the financial services industry, there is no strong empirical\nevidence that such policies improve long-term corporate performance. The Board believes, in contrast to\nreceived wisdom in the banking industry, that this practice may deprive corporations of substantial expertise and\nvaluable counsel. The Board is also skeptical of the emerging consensus amongst corporate governance\ncommentators that boards should mechanically “refresh” themselves by implementing term limits. Given the\ncyclical nature of the banking industry, many of the risks to the Bank present themselves infrequently and\nmechanical “refreshment” would deprive the Bank of substantial historical experience.

Melej 46 Vice President - Chief Financial Officer\nDaniel Bagley 39 Vice President - Chief Information Officer\nHolly M. Cirignano 44 Vice President - Chief of Staff\n______________________\nRobert H. Gaughen, Jr. , the Bank’s principal executive officer, has served as Chief Executive Officer\nsince 1993.\nPatrick R. Gaughen joined the Bank in 2012 as Vice President - Chief Strategy and Corporate\nDevelopment Officer and was promoted to Senior Vice President - Chief Strategy and Corporate\nDevelopment Officer in April of 2013. In April 2014, he was promoted to Executive Vice President and\nin April 2018 was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. Before joining the Bank, Mr.\nGaughen was a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State providing analytical and\ndecision-support for senior U.S. policymakers regarding U.S. foreign policy in the Near East.\nCristian A. Melej , the Bank’s Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, joined the Bank in 2016 as\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before joining the Bank, Mr. Melej was an Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer at C1 Financial (and its subsidiary C1 Bank) from 2013 to 2016,\nand previously served as Financial Officer for Restoque Comércio e Confecção de Roupas S.A., a\npublicly listed Brazilian clothing retailer from 2011 to 2013. Mr. Melej is a CFA® charterholder and a\nlicensed Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\nDaniel Bagley joined the Bank in 2021 as Vice President - Chief Information Officer. Prior to joining\nthe Bank, Mr. Bagley served as Director of Information Technology for Northeast Bank and prior to that\nhe served as Technology Director for Santander Bank.\nHolly M. Cirignano joined the Bank in 2003. Between 2017 and 2022 she served as Vice President -\nSpecialized Deposit Group, where she was responsible for a team of relationship managers focused on\nthe Bank’s largest and most complex deposit customers. In 2022 she was promoted to Vice President -\nChief of Staff, where she assists the President and Chief Operating Officer with the execution of\nstrategic initiatives across the Bank.\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThe Committee, in addition to its other responsibilities, serves as the Bank’s Compensation Committee.\nIt annually reviews the compensation and benefits of senior management and makes recommendations about\ncompensation to the full Board of Directors. It solicits observations and recommendations from the Chief\nExecutive Officer and the President and Chief Operating Officer with regard to the performance of other\n16\nindividual members of senior management and invites their participation in their discussions before they\ndeliberate and make their decisions. Given the family relationship between the Chief Executive Officer and the\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, the Nominating and Personnel Committee also directly reviews the\nperformance of the President and Chief Operating Officer and reviews the same with the full Board of\nDirectors.\nThe Committee’s compensation philosophy is to set management compensation at such levels as to\nattract and retain senior executives who will contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Bank. Senior\nmanagement is compensated primarily through annual base salary and the long-term and short-term employee\nbenefits described below, supplemented occasionally by bonuses and stock option grants. The primary instance\nwhere the Committee employed a limited bonus plan to reward performance, which was in place until 2021,\nwas a plan for loan officers intended to reward the effective administration of a high-quality loan portfolio.\nThese awards took into consideration established internal performance goals but were made at the complete\ndiscretion of the Committee and the Board of Directors, and were not driven solely or even primarily by\nvolume. These awards were not considered to be “incentive” compensation as defined in the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and generally did not exceed 15% of a listed individual’s total\ncompensation. The Committee has since discontinued the practice of awarding bonuses to lenders and\nappropriately adjusts each individual’s base compensation to reflect their contribution to the success of the\nBank. Any risks arising from the Bank’s compensation policies and practices as it relates to loan officers are\nnot reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Bank, as they have no individual lending authority.\nThe Committee’s practices in regard to the mix of components within the executives’ overall compensation\npackages has developed for a number of reasons:\n● The Committee’s philosophy is to compensate primarily by means of annual base compensation\ndue to its belief that a larger base compensation reflects management’s actual long-term value to\nthe Bank. In this respect, the Committee does not believe in providing an arbitrarily low base\nsalary.\n● The Committee believes that short-term period-to-period changes in performance metrics do not\ndrive the intrinsic value of the Bank in a fundamental way. The Committee is also cognizant of\nrelevant experience within the commercial banking and thrift industries which counsels against\nproviding management with strong incentives to attain short-term performance goals. As such, the\nCommittee has eliminated short-term bonuses. Although their employment agreements provide\nfor the possibility of a discretionary bonus, the three most senior officers - Mr. R. Gaughen, Mr. P.\nGaughen and Mr. Melej - do not receive bonuses, and, as noted above, the Committee has\ndetermined not to award bonuses to its named executive officers effective for 2023.\n● The Committee also believes that existing levels of stock ownership by management and the Board\ngenerally establish sufficient alignment of stockholder and management interests. The ownership\ninterest of the two most senior officers - Mr. R. Gaughen and Mr. P. Gaughen - and their immediate\nfamily are such that their pro-rata interest in the capital and earnings of the Bank significantly\nexceeds their direct compensation.\nIn establishing its annual compensation recommendations for Messrs. Gaughen and the other executives,\nthe Committee considers the Bank’s current and long-term return on assets, return on equity, increases in book\nvalue per share and dividends declared, credit quality and operational efficiency. Long-term increases in the\nsize of the loan and deposit portfolios are considered insofar as they may drive performance in the above\nmetrics. The Committee additionally considers statistics regarding general compensation levels in the industry\n17\nand the Committee’s qualitative assessment of each executive’s own performance for the year as that\nperformance relates to maximizing long-term value for the Bank’s ownership. In doing so, the Committee relies\non its own good judgment without relying on specific quantitative formulas tying compensation to particular\nmeasures of financial performance or to industry-wide or peer-group compensation benchmarks. The\nCommittee is particularly skeptical of complex compensation systems designed and implemented by external\nconsultants. In 2022, the Committee retained Pearl Meyer for the purpose of reviewing the reasonability of the\nBank’s executive compensation levels and practices with respect to the Bank’s peers. The firm confirmed the\nreasonability of both the Bank’s executive compensation levels and practices. The Committee is engaging a\ncompensation consultant to conduct a similar review in 2024.\nThe Bank has employment agreements in place with Mr. R. Gaughen and Mr. P. Gaughen, and a change\nin control agreement in place with Mr. Melej. See “Employment Agreements and Change in Control\nAgreements.” The Committee believes that such agreements offer reasonable incentives to retain valued\nexecutives. The Bank does not have an employment agreement or change in control agreement in place with\neither Mr. Bagley or Mrs. Cirignano. Notwithstanding the provisions of their Employment Agreements, and in\nlight of the challenging environment in 2023, Mr. R. Gaughen, Mr. P. Gaughen each voluntarily reduced their\nannual base compensation by $300,000 over the course of the year. This was in addition to a $200,000\nvoluntary reduction in annual base compensation requested in December of 2022.\nThe Bank does not maintain deferred compensation arrangements or supplemental retirement plans for\nany members of management. All executives benefit from the Bank’s matching contributions to the Bank’s\n401(k) plan, which provides for an option for all full-time employees to purchase shares in the Bank at market\nprices. Executives participate in this plan according to the same terms as all other employees.\nThe Committee considers the results of the shareholder advisory vote on the Bank’s executive\ncompensation as part of its determination regarding the amount and mix of compensation awarded to our\nexecutive officers. At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an advisory vote\non executive compensation with approximately 95.7% of shares present and voting on such matter voting in\nfavor. At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an advisory vote on the Bank’s\nexecutive compensation with approximately 96.6% of shares present and voting on such matter voting in favor.\nThe Committee believes that the support received from our stockholders at the 2022 and 2023 Annual Meetings\nof Stockholders serves to validate the Committee’s approach to compensation, and the Committee did not make\nany changes in 2023 in response to the votes at the 2022 and 2023 Annual Meetings of Stockholders.\nCompensation Committee Report\nWe have reviewed and discussed the foregoing compensation discussion and analysis with management.\nBased on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the\ncompensation discussion and analysis be included in this proxy statement and in the Bank’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nSubmitted by: Howard M.

A discussion of the assumptions used in determining grant date fair value may\nbe found in note 11 to the Bank’s financial statements in the Bank’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year dated\nDecember 31, 2023, filed on March 6, 2024 with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for the\nassumptions relating to these awards.\n(4) Bonuses paid to Ms. Cirignano in 2022 and 2021 correspond to fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n19\nMr. Bagley’s $50,000 bonus was paid in 2021 upon joining the Bank.\nPay Ratio Disclosure\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and\nItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual\ntotal compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Robert H. Gaughen, Jr., our Chief\nExecutive Officer (our “CEO”):\nFor 2023, our last completed fiscal year:\n● The median of the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Bank (other than our CEO)\nwas $84,457; and\n● The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included\nelsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $1,824,435.\nBased on this information, for 2023 the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer’s annual total compensation\nwas 21.6 times that of the median employee.\nTo identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the\nannual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:\n1. We determined that, as of December 31, 2023, our employee population consisted of approximately 89\nindividuals, all located in the United States. This population consisted of our full-time, part-time, and\ntemporary employees.\n2. To identify the “median employee” from our employee population, we compared the amount of salary\nand wages of our employees as reflected in our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue\nService on Form W-2 for 2023.\n3. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to\nall our employees included in the calculation. Since all our employees are located in the United States,\nas is our CEO, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the “median employee.”\n4. Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee’s\ncompensation for 2023 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K,\nresulting in annual total compensation of $84,457. The difference between such employee’s salary,\nwages, and overtime pay and the employee’s annual total compensation represents the value of the\n401(k) plan matching and profit sharing contributions paid to the employee by the Bank.\n5. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the “Total”\ncolumn of our 2023 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.\n20\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS\nAll Other Option\nAwards: Number of Exercise or Base Grant Date Fair\nSecurities Underlying Price of Option Value of Stock and\nName Grant Date Options (#) Awards ($/Sh) Option Awards ($)\nRobert H.

Bank officers participate in the plan on the same basis as all\nother employees. Each participant may defer up to 75% of his or her income on a tax-favored basis, up to\napplicable Internal Revenue Service limits. The Bank’s matching contribution policy is to contribute $0.50 for\neach dollar contributed by the employee up to a maximum matching contribution equal to 3% of the employee’s\nyearly compensation. Additionally, the Bank makes a contribution equal to 3% of yearly compensation for all\n401(k) participants, whether or not they choose to make any contributions. All participants become fully vested\nafter two years of service or age 59½, if earlier.\nThe Bank does not have a defined benefit retirement plan or SERP.\nEmployment Agreements and Change in Control Agreements\nRobert H. Gaughen, Jr., the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, entered into an employment agreement with\nthe Bank dated April 26, 2018. This agreement superseded the prior employment agreement dated November\n20, 1995. The 2018 employment agreement terminated the SERP, increased Mr. Gaughen’s salary, and\nincorporated existing death and health benefits as provided below:\n● Death Benefit: In the event of Mr. R. Gaughen’s death during his employment with the Bank,\nthe Bank shall continue to pay an amount equal to his then-current base salary to Mr. R.\nGaughen’s designated beneficiary for a period of six months after such death. Mr. R. Gaughen’s\nemployment agreement incorporates a death benefit of $4,000,000 payable by the Bank to his\ndesignated beneficiaries, provided that the benefit will be reduced to $2,183,000 upon his\nattaining the age of 80. The Bank makes annual non-cash charges against earnings in\nanticipation of this event. In 2023, these charges amounted to $99,000, which amount is based\non actuarial assumptions rather than on insurance premiums or contributions. The Bank\nmaintains Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) as a partial hedge against this event. In total, the\nBank has accrued $1,710,000 to cover this future liability. The cash surrender value of all the\ninsurance policies owned by the Bank at December 31, 2023 was $13,642,000. The death\nbenefit of the insurance policies owned by the Bank at December 31, 2023 was approximately\n$18,807,000.\n● Post-Retirement Health Care: In 2006, Mr. R. Gaughen’s employment agreement was revised to\nprovide for post-retirement health insurance coverage (“health benefit”). It was also amended to\nreflect his voluntary waiver of his right to accelerate payment of all supplemental retirement\nbenefits upon early retirement on a date of his choosing. The Bank established an unfunded\npost-retirement health benefit plan for Mr. R. Gaughen at that time and began making non-cash\ncharges against earnings. The health benefit was incorporated in the 2018 Employment\nAgreement in the same terms. In 2023, no cash premiums or contributions were paid and, in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Bank did not incur non-cash\ncharges. In total, the Bank has accrued $608,000 to cover this future liability.\nMr. R. Gaughen’s salary is subject to review and adjustment no less frequently than annually, in an\namount reflecting cost-of-living increases as well as any merit increases which the Board of Directors may\nconsider appropriate. In December 2022, May 2023 and October 2023, given market conditions and challenges\nto the Bank’s performance, Mr. R. Gaughen requested that the Bank reduce his annual salary by $200,000,\n$100,000 and $200,000, respectively until further notice, without waiving or otherwise modifying any other\n23\nrights or obligations under his employment agreement. After these changes, Mr. R. Gaughen’s annual salary is\n$1,570,000, and he is eligible to participate on an equitable basis in all of the Bank’s bonus and fringe benefit\nplans, subject to applicable eligibility requirements. Furthermore, Mr. R. Gaughen’s employment agreement\nprovides that he may not be required to relocate outside the Bank’s primary geographic area. The contract\ncurrently provides for a term ending in April 2026. Unless either party gives written notice to the contrary, the\nterm of the agreement shall be extended for successive one-year periods in April of each year, provided that the\nthen remaining term of the contract never exceeds three years.\nPatrick R. Gaughen, the Bank’s President and Chief Operating Officer, entered into an employment\nagreement with the Bank dated April 24, 2014, which provides that Mr. P. Gaughen’s salary is subject to review\nand adjustment no less frequently than annually, in an amount reflecting cost-of-living increases as well as any\nmerit increases which the Board of Directors may consider appropriate. This agreement was amended on April\n26, 2018 to update Mr. P. Gaughen’s title to President and Chief Operating Officer. All other terms and\nconditions of the contract remained unchanged. In December 2022, May 2023 and October 2023, given market\nconditions and challenges to the Bank’s performance, Mr. P. Gaughen requested that the Bank reduce his annual\nsalary by $200,000, $100,000 and $200,000, respectively until further notice, without waiving or otherwise\nmodifying any other rights or obligations under his employment agreement. After this change, Mr. P.\nGaughen’s annual salary is $1,000,000, and he is eligible to participate on an equitable basis in all of the Bank’s\nbonus and fringe benefit plans, subject to applicable eligibility requirements. Furthermore, Mr. P. Gaughen’s\nemployment agreement provides that he may not be required to relocate outside the Bank’s primary geographic\narea. The contract currently provides for a term ending in April 2026. Unless either party gives written notice\nto the contrary, the term of the agreement shall be extended for successive one-year periods in April of each\nyear, provided that the then remaining term of the contract never exceeds three years.\nCristian A. Melej, the Bank’s Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, has entered into a change in\ncontrol agreement with the Bank dated October 17, 2016. Mr. Melej’s annual salary is currently $540,000, and\nhe is eligible to participate on an equitable basis in all of the Bank’s bonus and fringe benefit plans, subject to\napplicable eligibility requirements. The contract is reviewed annually to determine whether it will be extended\nfor one-year periods and currently provides for a term ending in April 2025. Unless either party gives written\nnotice to the contrary, the term of the agreement shall be extended for successive one-year periods in April of\neach year, provided that the then remaining term of the contract never exceeds two years.\nEach of the employment agreements described above for Mr. R. Gaughen and Mr. P. Gaughen has\nsimilar termination and change in control provisions. Should the executive resign during the term of the\ncontract, without the approval of the Board of Directors or in some circumstances following a change in control,\nas described below, the executive will forfeit all rights under the agreement and the Bank is entitled, among\nother things, to have the executive enjoined from working for another bank or thrift institution in Plymouth,\nBarnstable, or Norfolk County or certain other areas of Massachusetts during the remaining term. The Bank is\nentitled to terminate the executive’s employment at any time with or without cause. Termination without cause\nrequires the payment of severance pay in amounts equal to the executive’s salary over the remaining term of the\ncontract (but in no event for less than three months), plus continuation of employee benefits during such period.\nSuch payment is not to be reduced by any compensation which the executive may subsequently earn from other\nsources. In addition, should the executive become disabled so as to be unable to perform substantially all of his\nduties and responsibilities, the Bank shall pay disability benefits in an amount equal to 70% of the executive’s\nthen-current base salary for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the executive’s term (and for\nMr. P. Gaughen, the applicable “Expiration Date”) or (ii) the executive is no longer disabled.\nIf the executive were to be terminated by the Bank other than for cause or resign for good reason in\n24\nconnection with or within one year after such a change in control, he or she would be entitled to receive a lump\nsum cash payment (in lieu of his or her regular severance pay) equal to a multiple of their average annual\ncompensation (3.0 times, in the case of Mr. R. Gaughen and 2.99 times in the case of Mr. P. Gaughen) with\nrespect to the five most recent taxable years ending prior to such change in control (or such portion thereof as\nthey were full-time employees of the Bank), less one dollar and less any special bonus paid in connection with\nthe change in control. Such payment is not to be reduced by any compensation which the executive may\nsubsequently earn from other sources. If such lump sum cash payments had been made on December 31, 2023,\nthe approximate amounts payable would have been $6,486,000 for Mr. R. Gaughen and $3,667,000 for Mr. P.\nGaughen. If the executive were to terminate his or her employment voluntarily for good reason, as defined\nbelow, in connection with or within one year after a change in control, he or she would be entitled to receive a\nsimilar lump sum cash payment. “Good reason” includes a reduction in compensation, a forced relocation,\nmaterial increase in the executive’s duties, or a material decrease in the executive’s position.\nIn the case of Mr. Melej, the change in control agreement provides for payment equal to 2.0 times the\nhighest rate of base salary and annual cash bonus earned during the calendar year of termination or either for the\ntwo preceding years, as well as certain employee benefits for up to two years following Mr. Melej’s termination,\nupon or after the occurrence of a change of control or Mr. Melej’s voluntary termination on or after such change\nin control. If such lump sum cash payments had been made on December 31, 2023, the approximate amount\npayable to Mr. Melej would have been $1,080,000. If the executive were to terminate his employment\nvoluntarily in connection with or within one year after a change in control, he would be entitled to receive a\nsimilar lump sum cash payment.\nFinally, all unvested stock options granted to the executives will vest in the event of a change in control\nof the Bank.\nThe executives are not entitled to receive any of the foregoing payments to the extent that such\npayments would be considered excess “parachute payments” under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended. In addition, federal legislation authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under certain\ncircumstances to prohibit or limit payments that are contingent on the termination of a person’s employment\nwith an insured depository institution.\nMore Information about Plans and Agreements\nThe preceding discussion of executive compensation contains descriptions of various employee benefit\nplans and employment-related agreements. These descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the\nfull text or detailed descriptions of the plans and agreements which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to\nthe Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nAnti-Hedging Policy\nThe Bank’s Insider Trading Policy prohibits Directors, officers and employees from trading in options,\nwarrants, puts and calls or similar instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of\nthe Bank’s securities, other than the exercise of options granted to directors, officers, or employees by the Bank.\nPay versus Performance Disclosures\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and\nItem 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship between\nthe Bank’s executive pay and the performance of the Bank and its peer group during the most recent three fiscal\n25\nyears. In addition, pursuant to the “transition relief” instructions to Item 402(v), we are providing the foregoing\ncompensation information for the prior three fiscal years, instead of the prior five years.\nThe Board of Directors has selected the rolling 5-year Compounded Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) in\nTangible Book Value per Share as the measure that represents the most important financial measure linking the\nBank’s performance to executive compensation actually paid (“CAP”). Even though this measure does not\ninclude the benefit of capital distributions to stockholders by the Bank during the 5-year period, these\ndistributions have been implemented consistently by the Bank over the last thirty years. Furthermore, the Bank\ntypically holds an investment portfolio of equity securities investments which can significantly affect net\nincome in any particular year, as changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of net\nincome. Consistent with the Bank’s focus on performance through all stages of the economic cycle, the 5-year\nCAGR in Tangible Book Value per Share represents an intuitive indication of shareholder value creation over a\nperiod of time long enough to (i) capture such cycles and (ii) to reflect the long-term performance of the Bank’s\ninvestments in equity securities.\nPay versus Performance Table\nYear Summary Compensation Average Average Value of Initial Fixed $100 Net 5-year\nCompensation Actually Paid Summary Compensation Investment Based On: Income CAGR in\nTable Total to PEO Compensation Actually Paid ($000) Tangible\nfor Table Total to Non-PEO Total Peer Group Book\nPEO (1) for NEOs (3) Shareholder Total Value per\nNon-PEO Return Shareholder Share\nNEOs (2) (“TSR”) Return ( 4)\n2023 1,824,435 1,824,435 625,766 613,665 97.31 102.29 26,371 13.59%\n2022 2,124,611 2,124,611 669,293 636,777 136.30 110.72 37,519 15.54%\n2021 2,069,066 2,069,066 494,087 815,815 205.13 120.88 67,458 17.00%\n2020 2,074,400 2,074,400 507,031 511,208 104.68 86.61 50,771 16.15%\n___________\n(1) Robert H.

Gaughen, Cristian A. Melej,\nShawn T. Sullivan and Holly M. Cirignano.\n(3) To determine CAP, the totals included in the “Summary Compensation Table” for each year were\nadjusted to (i) replace the grant date fair value of equity awards during the current fiscal year with the\nfair value of such awards as of the current fiscal year-end and (ii) to incorporate the year-over-year\nchanges in the fair value of unvested equity granted in previous years, based on the year-end fair value\nor vesting date fair value if such vesting occurred during the year. The assumptions used in the\nvaluation of equity awards are consistent with those disclosed as of the grant date of such awards but\nreflective of conditions existent as of each valuation date.\n(4) The Bank has selected “S&P U.S. BMI Banks - New England Region Index”, which tracks a\npeer group of all publicly traded banks headquartered in New England.\n(5) Tangible Book Value per Share is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing total\nstockholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets by common stock outstanding. Since the Bank\ndoes not have goodwill and intangible assets, this ratio equals book value per share.\n26\nThe Bank’s 5-Year CAGR in Tangible Book Value per share over rolling five-year periods ending in\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 reflects the Bank’s consistent performance over such periods. In 2023, the\n5-Year CAGR in Tangible Book Value per share declined, driven by lower net income recorded by the Bank in\n2023. Net income in any single year is more variable, as it is affected by the performance of the Bank’s equity\nsecurities investment portfolio and the level of short-term interest rates. In 2023, the Bank’s net income\ndeclined significantly driven by the sharp increase in short-term rates and the yield curve inversion. The Bank’s\ncumulative TSR, which remained above the Peer Group TSR’s during the periods ended in December 31, 2020,\n2021 and 2022, declined significantly in 2023, reflecting the negative effects of the interest rate environment on\nthe Bank’s earnings and share price. The Bank’s CEO CAP, which increased gradually through 2022 and\ndeclined in 2023, has not been affected by the Bank’s stock price performance, reflecting no new equity awards\ngranted or unvested equity awards outstanding during this three-year period. The decline in 2023 reflects\nvoluntary salary reductions requested by the Bank’s CEO in late 2022 and 2023 given market conditions and\nchallenges to the Bank’s performance. The decline in Non-PEO’s CAP in 2023 reflects voluntary salary\nreductions requested by the Bank’s President and Chief Operating Officer in late 2022 and 2023 given market\nconditions and challenges to the Bank’s performance, as well as a decline in the fair value of outstanding\nunvested equity awards, consistent with the Bank’s TSR. The salaries of the remaining Non-PEOs remained\nunchanged in 2023.\nIn addition to the 5-year CAGR in Tangible Book Value per Share, the Bank has identified the following\nfinancial measures linking the Bank’s performance to executive CAP:\nMost Important Measures for Determining NEO Pay\n5-year CAGR in Tangible Book Value per Share\n3- year average in Return on Average Equity\n3- year average in Annual Operational Expense (Non-interest Expense) to Average Assets\n3- year average in Annual Net Charge-Offs to Average Loans\n5-year CAGR in Gross Loan Balances\n5-year CAGR in Gross Deposit Balances\n27\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nDirectors of the Bank receive $1,800 for each Board of Directors meeting they attend. Messrs. R. and P.\nGaughen do not receive any fees in conjunction with their Board service. The Clerk of the Bank receives a\nstipend of $13,860 per annum plus an additional fee of $285 per meeting attended.\nEach member of a committee of the Board of Directors receives an additional $1,800 for each\ncommittee meeting attended. The Clerk and Chairman of these committees each receive an additional fee of\n$285 per meeting attended. Board compensation is reviewed and approved by the Board annually. The Board\nbelieves that Directors should be owner-oriented and should have a meaningful portion of their net worth\ninvested in the Bank.\nThe following table presents Director compensation for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFees Earned or Option\nName Total ($)\nPaid in Cash ($) Awards ($) (1)\nHoward M.

On December 31, 2023, the aggregate number of\nshares subject to option awards outstanding for Directors were: Michael J. Desmond (2,000); Kevin W.\nGaughen, Jr. (1,000); Julio R. Hernando (1,000); Robert K. Sheridan (850); Kara Gaughen Smith\n(2,000); and Jacqueline M. Youngworth (1,000). For Patrick R. Gaughen and Robert H. Gaughen, Jr.,\nsee “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End.”\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe current members of the Nominating and Personnel Committee, the Bank’s Compensation\nCommittee, are Mr. Berger, Mr. Desmond and Mrs. Youngworth, who also serves as the Bank’s Clerk. No\nmember of the Nominating and Personnel Committee was an employee of the Bank at any time during the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023, and none was an officer of the Bank, nor has any member of the Nominating\n28\nand Personnel Committee had any relationship with the Bank requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation\nS-K under the Exchange Act.\nNone of the Bank’s executive officers has served as a Director or member of the Compensation\nCommittee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, one of whose executive\nofficers served as a Director of or member of the Nominating and Personnel Committee.\nCERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND ASSOCIATES\nIndebtedness of Management and Associates\nIn November 1993, the Bank adopted a policy providing that the Bank will not extend credit (excluding\npassbook loans) to Directors and Officers of the Bank, Principal Stockholders, their related interests, or any\nentities in which Directors or Officers or Principal Stockholders have a significant financial interest. This\npolicy was informed by the experience of the Directors at that time as private investors in New England banks\nand thrifts, including the Bank, that suffered significant losses because of poor controls over insider lending.\nThe Board believes this policy has been validated by more recent bank failures in which insider lending\ncontributed to significant losses. The Board strongly believes that insider lending, even when well-intentioned\nand subject to strong and functioning internal controls, poses an unacceptable risk to banks. Through this\npolicy, the Bank seeks to eliminate this risk rather than manage it.\nTo the extent the Bank has extended any fully secured passbook loans to Directors, Officers, Principal\nStockholders, or related interests, Bank’s management at the time of the origination of such loans represented\nthem as having been made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including\ninterest rates, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. On\nDecember 31, 2023, no such loans were outstanding and no such loans were extended during 2023.\nOther Transactions\nThe Bank may engage in additional transactions with, or use products or services of, Directors,\nnominees for Director, principal officers, principal stockholders or various organizations in which such persons\nmay have interests or of which such persons may be Directors, nominees for Director, officers, partners or\nprincipal stockholders. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2023, unless specifically disclosed herein,\nany amounts so involved have not been material in relation to the business of the Bank, and it is believed that\nother than as described below, the amount involved in any such transaction or series of transactions did not\nexceed $60,000 and was not otherwise material in relation to the business of any such person or other\norganization.\nDuring 2023, the Bank paid legal fees, including disbursements, to the law firm of Gaughen, Gaughen,\nLane & Hernando LLP. These fees amounted to $1,784,000 in connection with representation of the Bank in\ncommercial and residential mortgage loan originations, foreclosure and collection actions and certain other\nroutine litigation. Additionally, the Bank paid $800,000 in agency fees for title insurance due to the firm in\nconnection with loan originations. All of the above described legal fees and title insurance fees paid to the law\nfirm of Gaughen, Gaughen, Lane & Hernando LLP have been reimbursed to the Bank by its borrowers, with the\nexception of $292,303. These “unreimbursed” fees are primarily associated with foreclosure and collection\nmatters and the Bank generally collects these fees from borrowers upon resolution of a troubled loan through\nforeclosure, litigation, or the loan returning to performing status. The Bank believes that the foregoing sums\nhave been reasonable in relation to the services provided to the Bank. All of these services are provided\npursuant to a written master agreement between the Bank and the law firm of Gaughen, Gaughen, Lane &\n29\nHernando LLP. This agreement was reviewed and approved by the independent Directors of the Board.\nThe Bank strongly believes that using a single law firm to oversee all conveyancing, transactional, and\ncollection activity provides material benefits to the Bank with respect to operational efficiency, quality, and\nspeed of execution. The Bank also believes that the transparent alignment of interests between the Bank and the\nfirm solves certain principal-agent problems that would arise if multiple, unrelated firms represented the Bank.\nIn accordance with the terms of this agreement, the above fees are presented to the Board of Directors on a\nmonthly basis. It is expected that the Bank will continue to have similar transactions with, and use the services\nof, the law firm of Gaughen, Gaughen, Lane & Hernando LLP in the future. Directors Kevin W. Gaughen, Jr,.\nRobert A. Lane and Julio R. Hernando are partners of Gaughen, Gaughen, Lane & Hernando LLP.\nIt is expected that any future transactions between the Bank and its Directors, officers, holders of 5% or\nmore of the shares of any class of its voting stock or any affiliates thereof will be on terms no less favorable to\nthe Bank than could be obtained by the Bank in arm’s length negotiation with unaffiliated third parties. Any\nsuch transactions would be subject to review and approval by members of the Board of Directors independent\nwith respect to said transactions.\n30\nPRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS:\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to ownership of the Common Stock, the Bank’s\nonly voting security, by the Bank’s Directors, nominees for Director and executive officers as of February 1,\n2024.

As part of that commitment, the Board of Directors is providing the\nBank’s stockholders with an annual opportunity to approve an advisory vote on the compensation of our named\nexecutive officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the compensation tables and the related narrative discussion\ncontained in this Proxy Statement.\nThis proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives the Bank’s stockholders the\nopportunity to endorse or not endorse the Bank’s executive pay program and policies. We are asking\nstockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of the Bank’s named executive officers as disclosed\nin this Proxy Statement by voting FOR the following advisory resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Bank’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant\nto applicable rules in this Proxy Statement, is hereby approved.”\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Bank.

At our\n2023 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved an advisory vote on the Bank’s executive compensation with\napproximately 96.6% of the shares present and voting on such matter voting in favor.

While the Bank is not required to have\nstockholders ratify the selection of Wolf & Company, P.C. as the Bank’s independent registered public\naccounting firm, and this vote is only advisory, the Board considers the selection of the independent registered\npublic accounting firm to be an important matter and is therefore submitting the selection of Wolf & Company,\nP.C. for ratification by stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice.\nThe Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of ratifying the appointment of Wolf &\nCompany, P.C. as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. We are asking stockholders to\nindicate their support for the appointment of Wolf & Company, P.C. by voting FOR the following advisory\nresolution:\n“RESOLVED, that the appointment of Wolf and Company, P.C. as the Bank’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm is hereby approved.”\nIf stockholders do not ratify selection of the Bank’s independent registered public accounting firm, the\nAudit Committee will reconsider the appointment of Wolf & Company, P.C. at the appropriate time. The Bank\nanticipates, however, that there would be no immediate change in the Bank’s independent registered public\naccounting firm this fiscal year if stockholders do not ratify the selection of Wolf & Company, P.C. because of\nthe practical difficulty and expense associated with making such a change mid-year. The Audit Committee may\nretain Wolf & Company, P.C. for 2024 notwithstanding a negative shareholder vote or, even if stockholders\nratify the selection of Wolf & Company, P.C., the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, change the Bank’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that it would be in the best interests of\nthe Bank to do so.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the appointment of Wolf and\nCompany as the Bank’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\n39\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected the independent registered public\naccounting firm of Wolf & Company, P.C.

These advance notice provisions are in addition to, and\nseparate from, the requirements that a stockholder must meet in order to have a proposal included in the proxy\nstatement under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. In this regard, the Bank’s By-Laws provide that\nany Director nominations and new business submitted by stockholders must be filed with the Clerk of the Bank\nat the principal executive offices of the Bank at least 90 days (January 24, 2025), but not more than 120 days\n(December 26, 2024), prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting unless the date of the\nannual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary\nof the preceding year’s annual meeting, in which event the By-Laws state different notice requirements. The\nBy-Laws also provide that no other nominations or proposals by stockholders shall be acted upon at the\nmeeting. Any such Rule 14a-8 proposal or nomination submitted pursuant to the advance notice provision\nshould be mailed to: Clerk, Hingham Institution for Savings, 55 Main Street, Hingham, MA 02043.\nSTOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS\nSome banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of\n“householding” proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one copy of our proxy statement or\nannual report may have been sent to multiple stockholders in the same household. We will promptly deliver a\nseparate copy of either document to any stockholder upon request submitted in writing to us in care of Robert\nH. Gaughen, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Hingham Institution for Savings, 55 Main Street, Hingham, MA\n02043, or submitted over the phone by calling us at (781) 749-2200. Any stockholder who wants to receive\nseparate copies of the annual report and proxy statement in the future, or who is currently receiving multiple\ncopies and would like to receive only one copy for his or her household, should contact his or her bank, broker\n42\nor other nominee record holder, or contact us at the above address and phone number.\nEXPENSES OF SOLICITATION\nThe Bank will bear the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the Notice, Proxy Statement and form\nof proxy for the Meeting. Solicitation of proxies will be primarily through the use of mails, but regular\nemployees of the Bank may solicit proxies by personal interview, by telephone or by mail without additional\nremuneration therefore. The Bank will also provide persons, firms, banks and corporations holding shares in\ntheir names, or in the names of their nominees, which in either case are beneficially owned by others, with\nproxy materials for transmittal to such beneficial owners and will reimburse such record holders for their\nreasonable expenses in so doing. In addition, the Bank has retained Regan & Associates, Inc. to aid in the\nsolicitation of proxies from individuals, brokers, bank nominees and other institutional holders for the 2023\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders, for which a base fee of $8,500 (plus out-of-pocket expenses) will be paid.\nIt is very important that your shares be represented. Therefore, it would be helpful if you would sign\nand date the enclosed form of proxy and promptly return it.\nANNUAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT & ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nThe Bank’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, can be obtained at www.hinghamsavings.com and constitutes the\nannual disclosure statement of the Bank and is also available to the public at the main office and each branch\noffice of the Bank.
