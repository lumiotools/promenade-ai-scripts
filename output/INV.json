In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the Company’s future financial or operating performance and may refer to projections and forecasts. Forward-looking statements are often identified by future or conditional words such as “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “continue,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “possible,” “will,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “would” and other similar words and expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions), but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.\n\nThe forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the Company’s management and are inherently subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances and their potential effects and speak only as of the date of this press release. There can be no assurance that future developments will be those that have been anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the control of the parties) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors discussed and identified in other public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company and the following: (a) expectations regarding the Company’s and the Innventure Companies’ (as defined below) strategies and future financial performance, including their future business plans, expansion and acquisition plans or objectives, prospective performance and opportunities and competitors, revenues, products and services, pricing, operating expenses, market trends, liquidity, cash flows and uses

growth; (h) developments and projections relating to the Company’s and the Innventure Companies’ competitors and industry; (i) the Innventure Companies’ ability to meet, and to continue to meet,

breakthrough technology solutions from multinational corporations (“MNCs”) and to satisfy the requirements imposed by or to avoid disagreements with its current and future MNC partners; (l) the risk that the Company may be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, which would impose burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on its activities; (m) the Company’s ability to sufficiently protect the intellectual property rights of itself and its subsidiaries, and to avoid or resolve in a timely and cost-effective manner any disputes that may arise relating to its use of the intellectual property of third parties; (n) the risk of a cyber-attack or a failure of the Company’s information technology and data security infrastructure; (o) the ability to

The Series A funding round started in early 2024.\n\n“This investment is a testament to our team’s intense focus on operational innovation and technological ingenuity,” said Josh Claman, Accelsius’ CEO. “We believe that with AI’s rapid growth, we all must aim to make the surrounding infrastructure as efficient as possible. Liquid cooling is the future of data center cooling, and Accelsius is positioned to lead that future.”\n\nAccelsius will use the funds to accelerate its plans for an international presence, continue to grow shipments and revenue in the U.S., and expand its professional teams across engineering, R&D, sales, marketing, manufacturing and operations. The company, recently selected as one of Austin Business Journal's 2024 Best Places to Work, already employs some of the industry's brightest and best thermal scientists and enterprise-grade system engineers.\n\nFunding for this round has been provided from and privately raised by Innventure, Inc. (NASDAQ:INV), who founded Accelsius in June 2022. Innventure is a technology commercialization platform that founds, funds and supports the launch and scale of its companies with a focus on transformative technology solutions.\n\n“From its beginning, Accelsius has exhibited all the qualities of a market disruptor,” said Bill Haskell, CEO of Innventure. “We are proud to see all the great progress that Josh and his team have made to produce critical infrastructure required to support the massive growth in data centers and related markets. To go from founding to revenue generation in less than three years is truly impressive, and we couldn’t be more excited for Accelsius’ future.”\n\n**Addressing Rising Energy Costs with Unmatched Thermal Performance**\n\nThe worldwide AI boom has changed the equation for data center operators. For years, data centers remained relatively stable in their power consumption. But a ChatGPT query requires nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search, forcing operators to reckon with rapidly rising demand. [Goldman Sachs Research](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goldmansachs.com%2Fintelligence%2Fpages%2FAI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand.html&esheet=54150626&newsitemid=20241113132557&lan=en-US&anchor=Goldman+Sachs+Research&index=2&md5=4ff2dba8f0026cae9449271d3af0486d) estimates that data center power demand will grow 160% by 2030.\n\nAccelsius' NeuCool system addresses the cooling challenges of modern data centers by delivering substantial gains in efficiency and sustainability. Compared to conventional cooling methods, NeuCool offers an estimated 50% reduction in energy use and a remarkable 10 times rack power density improvement, all while eliminating water consumption. Tested to handle thermal loads exceeding 2,200 watts per server chip (CPU, GPU), NeuCool is optimally suited for the high-powered servers that drive AI, machine learning, high-performance computing and other computationally intensive workloads prevalent in today's data centers.\n\nTo learn more about Accelsius’ NeuCool two-phase direct-to-chip in-rack liquid cooling solution, email info@accelsius.com or visit [accelsius.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Faccelsius.com&esheet=54150626&newsitemid=20241113132557&lan=en-US&anchor=accelsius.com&index=3&md5=efd6b8a5f80be58fd45521631f3a3303).\n\n**About Accelsius**\n\nAccelsius, founded by Innventure, Inc., empowers data center and edge operators to meet their business, financial and sustainability goals through next-generation cooling systems. The Accelsius NeuCool Platform delivers proprietary two-phase, direct-to-chip liquid cooling systems with best-in-class thermal efficiencies. NeuCool uses a sustainable, safe dielectric fluid and intelligent monitoring to provide a risk-free technology that scales from a single rack to an entire data center. NeuCool technology combined with Accelsius' US-based manufacturing and robust professional services program gives data center operators the confidence to evolve cooling approaches while ensuring performance improvements and continued uptime.
