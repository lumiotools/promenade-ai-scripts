(“Aptose” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APTO, TSX: APS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing highly differentiated oral targeted agents to treat hematologic malignancies, today announced initiation of the TUSCANY study, tuspetinib (TUS) in combination therapy with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) as a frontline triplet combination therapy for patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. The trial is being conducted at multiple U.S. clinical sites.\n\nTuspetinib is being developed for frontline AML therapy as part of the TUS+VEN+AZA triplet for newly diagnosed AML patients ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. Tuspetinib, a convenient once daily oral agent that potently targets SYK, FLT3, mutated KIT, JAK1/2, and RSK2 kinases, avoids many typical toxicity concerns observed with other agents and has the potential to treat the larger AML populations, not just narrow subpopulations. In the recently conducted Phase 1/2 APTIVATE trial in a very ill and heavily pre-treated relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML population, tuspetinib as a single agent (TUS) and in combination with venetoclax (TUS+VEN) safely achieved broad activity across various difficult-to-treat AML subpopulations. This included patients with prior-VEN, prior-FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i) and prior-[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sQ81f3W10-Vp7Tmkh85rvitwDaJAr57EIOZ5Zo9Za4ALiGaQfk7Dgfv4kEoPd5BRPpv1ttNK5z3lRABpC6TUmwTLQs7yVexSHqtqJz8idxuLM68UlTnpmlE6xa3d2P6zfBdtlQcD2Gx2hrdqZkxa0rhLkx1HEoNNcgIDNoop_NzksVv2RReUYTERLwU6UO_dMETWTT8PlLtHf4cJdGstJ6TdrF1o_aChiPMsUIVhkl_zpr_U5ShK3VXFXQ1RIskqOaJcmBWz7-A_t1WULTT_FWgje4f6oMEVLkrkiCFYBWPVI0xWFse6TvS1SqLIHHMxtEdmclRMejSWFA-KLnpU3Ztv2cJ8GJ4QeVppzyrIS3deHG0qTzdG45r0vyprm9M0Kqd2pIPYJhXnyUBRobRIkPchAdihushXREnZDWWnLmg=) (HSCT) therapies, those with highly adverse genetics - including mutations in TP53 and RAS genes, and those with mutated or unmutated (wildtype) FLT3 genes. \n\n“Initiation of the trial is a key milestone for Aptose. AML treatment has rapidly shifted to combination therapies, and we are pleased to include tuspetinib as part of TUS+VEN+AZA triplet combination therapy in patients with newly-diagnosed AML – representing a new patient population for TUS,” said William G. Rice, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We thank our investigators for their enthusiasm and our clinical team for activating the TUSCANY triplet study. As one of our investigators noted, if TUS brings added efficacy to frontline treatment of a broad array of AML patients without the added toxicities that are plaguing some other agents, we may have a game changer in TUS.”\n\n**TUSCANY: TUS+VEN+AZA Triplet Phase 1/2 Study** The triplet Phase 1/2 study is designed to test various doses and schedules of TUS in combination with standard of care dosing of azacitidine and venetoclax. TUS will be administered in 28-day cycles, beginning with 40mg, with dose escalations planned after safety review of each dose level. A planned 12 sites in the US will enroll in the TUSCANY trial with anticipated enrollment of 18-24 patients by mid-late 2025.\n\nMore information on the TUSCANY Phase 1/2 study can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov ([here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8nuh-wiyQspJuRrzMXxtV91HbH2ci49l_a7nkGTRhGI81psmjSnzOgd-CTWde62R24uodhIqpqes1dAq-CuYAPnhWPqv53J9CqYvSZyggBGvrDnRenQlhp0_B8lXIRfq88WVBtNDSoV24pJhGKvi0kH4PBcu-ntUYy3KZZn8W_-VuEwaIbvnz-tdETvqXBVhCZ9zr1n6v5LYrZs3G1Punk_PNWIYn1pT29DWiCPs283BY4os6JsodnidaywxTVrqAP4nMDrAZI42lrsAFDcw7xyutI1qCESeAibY6pIJHuw=)).\n\n**About Aptose** Aptose Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing precision medicines addressing unmet medical needs in oncology, with an initial focus on hematology.

(“Aptose” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APTO, TSX: APS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing highly differentiated oral targeted agents to treat hematologic malignancies, today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n\"Triple drug therapies (triplets) that build on the standard of care in AML have yielded higher response rates yet are limited to specific subpopulations and often cause myelosuppression and other toxicities,” said William G.

(“Hanmi”), and that the companies are actively negotiating a new tuspetinib co-development collaboration agreement intended to provide additional support to accelerate the clinical development of tuspetinib. The loan is convertible as prepayment of milestone obligations under the future collaboration agreement or repayable after the expected completion of a triple drug combination trial with tuspetinib in newly diagnosed AML patients. Aptose plans to use the proceeds from such loan for the development of tuspetinib. \n  * **Tuspetinib Data Drives Interest as Treatment Paradigm for AML Shifts to Triplet Therapy** – During our APTIVATE trial, tuspetinib (TUS) as a monotherapy and in combination treatment with venetoclax in a very ill AML patient population safely demonstrated broad clinical activity in AML patients with diverse mutation profiles, including those with adverse genetics. As presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2024 Congress in June, tuspetinib potently targets SYK, FLT3, mutated KIT, JAK1/2, and RSK2 kinases, yet avoids many typical toxicities, drug-related discontinuations, and deaths observed with other agents. In the APTIVATE trial, TUS achieved broad activity across AML patients with a diverse array of mutations, both as a single agent (TUS) and in combination with venetoclax (TUS+VEN) in very ill relapsed/refractory (R/R) and heavily pre-treated AML populations. Responses were observed in patients with Prior-VEN, Prior-FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i), and Prior-HSCT therapies, those with highly adverse genetics, including mutations in TP53 and RAS genes, and those with mutated or unmutated (wildtype) FLT3 genes. Patients naïve to VEN therapy achieved higher response rates. TUS appears to be an ideal third agent to add to a venetoclax and hypomethylating agent regimen. These data support the launch of the triplet therapy trial in newly diagnosed AML patients who are ineligible to receive induction chemotherapy, irrespective of their FLT3 mutation status. Other triplet therapies in development can achieve high response rates but are limited by toxicities and inability to treat certain AML populations, leaving an unmet need that may be addressed with the addition of tuspetinib. With Hanmi’s support, Aptose plans to initiate its planned triplet combination study during the quarter and to treat patients with and without FLT3 mutations. In addition, the company is evaluating other co-development opportunities to further expand the role of tuspetinib in other settings.\n  * **Nasdaq** – Aptose has a scheduled meeting with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications during the current quarter to address compliance with the minimum requirement of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity (the \"Stockholders’ Equity Requirement\") and Aptose continues to work on its compliance with minimum $1.00 per share closing bid price for thirty (30) consecutive business days, needed for continued listing on Nasdaq (the \"Minimum Bid Price Requirement\").On April 2, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement. The Company submitted a Compliance Plan to Nasdaq on this issue on May 17, 2024 and received an extension to meet this Nasdaq requirement by September 30, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension because it did not complete its proposed financing initiatives to regain compliance. On October 8, 2024, the Company requested an appeal and hearing; such hearing is scheduled for November 21, 2024.On July 16, 2024, Aptose announced that it had received a deficiency letter notifying the Company that was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. This deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common shares, and its common shares will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"APTO\" at this time. The Company's common shares continue to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") under the symbol \"APS\". The Company's listing on the TSX is independent and will not be affected by the Nasdaq listing status. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days, or until January 13, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by January 13, 2025, the Company may, at Nasdaq’s discretion, be afforded a second one hundred and eighty (180) calendar day period to regain compliance, but if Nasdaq does not grant such extension, the Company’s common shares could be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n\n\n**Multiple Planned Value-creating Milestones Ahead**\n\n**2024: Q4** ​\n\n  * Initiate dosing of TUS+VEN+AZA triplet in newly diagnosed AML​\n  * Completion of Hanmi/Aptose Collaboration ~ Year-end 2024​\n\n\n\n**2024: ASH** ​\n\n  * Report CR/Safety data from APTIVATE TUS+VEN doublet study ​\n  * Report dosing accrual from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study ​\n\n\n\n**2025: 1H** ​\n\n  * Enroll two dose cohorts in TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​\n  * Report CR/MRD/Safety data from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​\n\n\n\n**2025: EHA** ​\n\n  * Report maturing data readout from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​ \n\n\n\n**2025: ASH** ​\n\n  * Select TUS dose for TUS+VEN+HMA triplet Ph 2/3 PIVOTAL trials​\n  * Prepare for Ph 2 portion of Ph 2 / Ph 3 pivotal program​\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS** Aptose Biosciences Inc.Statements of Operations Data(unaudited)($ in thousands, except per share data)  \n---  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024  | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nExpenses:  \nResearch and development | $ | 4,702 | $ | 8,256 | $ | 15,560 | $ | 27,649  \nGeneral and administrative | 2,263 | 3,425 | 8,510 | 12,580  \nOperating expenses | 6,965 | 11,681 | 24,070 | 40,229  \nOther income, net | 12 | 234 | 225 | 977  \nNet loss | $ | (6,953 | ) | $ | (11,447 | ) | $ | (23,845 | ) | $ | (39,252 | )  \nNet Loss per share, Basic and diluted | $ | (0.37 | ) | $ | (1.76 | ) | $ | (1.48 | ) | $ | (6.14 | )  \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted (in thousands) | 18,560 | 6,495 | 16,107 | 6,391  \n  \nNet loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $4.5 million to $7.0 million, as compared to $11.4 million for the comparable period in 2023.

Changes to the components of our research and development expenses presented in the table above are primarily as a result of the following events:\n\n  * Program costs for tuspetinib were $4.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with $5.8 million for the comparative period in 2023. The lower program costs for tuspetinib in the current period represent the reduction of activity in our APTIVATE clinical trial, reduced manufacturing costs, and related expenses. In the comparative period in 2023, tuspetinib program costs included the healthy volunteer study, which was completed in 2023. \n  * Program costs for luxeptinib decreased by approximately $873 thousand, primarily due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing activities. \n  * Program costs for APTO-253 decreased by approximately $2 thousand. The Company discontinued further clinical development of APTO-253. \n  * Personnel-related expenses decreased by $582 thousand, related to fewer employees in the current three-month period. \n  * Stock-based compensation decreased by approximately $340 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to stock options granted with lower grant date fair values in the current period and option forfeitures recorded in the current period. \n\n\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $12.0 million to $15.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $27.6 million for the comparative period in 2023. Changes to the components of our research and development expenses presented in the table above are primarily as a result of the following events:\n\n  * Program costs for tuspetinib were $10.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $8 million compared with $18.7 million for the comparative period in 2023. The lower program costs for tuspetinib in the current period represent the reduction of activity in our APTIVATE clinical trial, reduced manufacturing costs, and related expenses. In the comparative period in 2023, tuspetinib program costs included the healthy volunteer study, which was completed in 2023. \n  * Program costs for luxeptinib decreased by approximately $2.4 million to $287 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.6 million in the comparative period, primarily due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing activities. \n  * Program costs for APTO-253 decreased by approximately $15 thousand, due to the Company’s decision on December 20, 2021 to discontinue further clinical development of APTO-253. \n  * Personnel-related expenses decreased by $834 thousand, related to fewer employees in the current six-month period and partially offset by salary increases. \n  * Stock-based compensation decreased by approximately $865 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to stock options granted with lower grant date fair values, in the current period. \n\n\n\n**About Aptose**\n\nAptose Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing precision medicines addressing unmet medical needs in oncology, with an initial focus on hematology.

(“Aptose” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APTO, TSX: APS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing highly differentiated oral targeted agents to treat hematologic malignancies, today announced financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n\"Triple drug therapies (triplets) that build on the standard of care in AML have yielded higher response rates yet are limited to specific subpopulations and often cause myelosuppression and other toxicities,” said William G. Rice, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aptose. “Tuspetinib, with its breadth of activity and unique safety profile, is a potential game-changer as part of a triplet therapy regimen and we continue to advance its development.”\n\n**Key Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Aptose Facility Agreement with Hanmi** – During the quarter, Aptose announced that it received a $10 million loan through a Facility Agreement with Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. (“Hanmi”), and that the companies are actively negotiating a new tuspetinib co-development collaboration agreement intended to provide additional support to accelerate the clinical development of tuspetinib. The loan is convertible as prepayment of milestone obligations under the future collaboration agreement or repayable after the expected completion of a triple drug combination trial with tuspetinib in newly diagnosed AML patients. Aptose plans to use the proceeds from such loan for the development of tuspetinib. \n  * **Tuspetinib Data Drives Interest as Treatment Paradigm for AML Shifts to Triplet Therapy** – During our APTIVATE trial, tuspetinib (TUS) as a monotherapy and in combination treatment with venetoclax in a very ill AML patient population safely demonstrated broad clinical activity in AML patients with diverse mutation profiles, including those with adverse genetics. As presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2024 Congress in June, tuspetinib potently targets SYK, FLT3, mutated KIT, JAK1/2, and RSK2 kinases, yet avoids many typical toxicities, drug-related discontinuations, and deaths observed with other agents. In the APTIVATE trial, TUS achieved broad activity across AML patients with a diverse array of mutations, both as a single agent (TUS) and in combination with venetoclax (TUS+VEN) in very ill relapsed/refractory (R/R) and heavily pre-treated AML populations. Responses were observed in patients with Prior-VEN, Prior-FLT3 inhibitor (FLT3i), and Prior-HSCT therapies, those with highly adverse genetics, including mutations in TP53 and RAS genes, and those with mutated or unmutated (wildtype) FLT3 genes. Patients naïve to VEN therapy achieved higher response rates. TUS appears to be an ideal third agent to add to a venetoclax and hypomethylating agent regimen. These data support the launch of the triplet therapy trial in newly diagnosed AML patients who are ineligible to receive induction chemotherapy, irrespective of their FLT3 mutation status. Other triplet therapies in development can achieve high response rates but are limited by toxicities and inability to treat certain AML populations, leaving an unmet need that may be addressed with the addition of tuspetinib. With Hanmi’s support, Aptose plans to initiate its planned triplet combination study during the quarter and to treat patients with and without FLT3 mutations. In addition, the company is evaluating other co-development opportunities to further expand the role of tuspetinib in other settings.\n  * **Nasdaq** – Aptose has a scheduled meeting with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications during the current quarter to address compliance with the minimum requirement of $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity (the \"Stockholders’ Equity Requirement\") and Aptose continues to work on its compliance with minimum $1.00 per share closing bid price for thirty (30) consecutive business days, needed for continued listing on Nasdaq (the \"Minimum Bid Price Requirement\").On April 2, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement. The Company submitted a Compliance Plan to Nasdaq on this issue on May 17, 2024 and received an extension to meet this Nasdaq requirement by September 30, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension because it did not complete its proposed financing initiatives to regain compliance. On October 8, 2024, the Company requested an appeal and hearing; such hearing is scheduled for November 21, 2024.On July 16, 2024, Aptose announced that it had received a deficiency letter notifying the Company that was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. This deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common shares, and its common shares will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"APTO\" at this time. The Company's common shares continue to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") under the symbol \"APS\". The Company's listing on the TSX is independent and will not be affected by the Nasdaq listing status. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days, or until January 13, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by January 13, 2025, the Company may, at Nasdaq’s discretion, be afforded a second one hundred and eighty (180) calendar day period to regain compliance, but if Nasdaq does not grant such extension, the Company’s common shares could be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n\n\n**Multiple Planned Value-creating Milestones Ahead**\n\n**2024: Q4** ​\n\n  * Initiate dosing of TUS+VEN+AZA triplet in newly diagnosed AML​\n  * Completion of Hanmi/Aptose Collaboration ~ Year-end 2024​\n\n\n\n**2024: ASH** ​\n\n  * Report CR/Safety data from APTIVATE TUS+VEN doublet study ​\n  * Report dosing accrual from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study ​\n\n\n\n**2025: 1H** ​\n\n  * Enroll two dose cohorts in TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​\n  * Report CR/MRD/Safety data from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​\n\n\n\n**2025: EHA** ​\n\n  * Report maturing data readout from TUS+VEN+AZA triplet study​ \n\n\n\n**2025: ASH** ​\n\n  * Select TUS dose for TUS+VEN+HMA triplet Ph 2/3 PIVOTAL trials​\n  * Prepare for Ph 2 portion of Ph 2 / Ph 3 pivotal program​\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS** Aptose Biosciences Inc.Statements of Operations Data(unaudited)($ in thousands, except per share data)  \n---  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024  | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nExpenses:  \nResearch and development | $ | 4,702 | $ | 8,256 | $ | 15,560 | $ | 27,649  \nGeneral and administrative | 2,263 | 3,425 | 8,510 | 12,580  \nOperating expenses | 6,965 | 11,681 | 24,070 | 40,229  \nOther income, net | 12 | 234 | 225 | 977  \nNet loss | $ | (6,953 | ) | $ | (11,447 | ) | $ | (23,845 | ) | $ | (39,252 | )  \nNet Loss per share, Basic and diluted | $ | (0.37 | ) | $ | (1.76 | ) | $ | (1.48 | ) | $ | (6.14 | )  \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted (in thousands) | 18,560 | 6,495 | 16,107 | 6,391  \n  \nNet loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $4.5 million to $7.0 million, as compared to $11.4 million for the comparable period in 2023.

Changes to the components of our research and development expenses presented in the table above are primarily as a result of the following events:\n\n  * Program costs for tuspetinib were $4.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with $5.8 million for the comparative period in 2023. The lower program costs for tuspetinib in the current period represent the reduction of activity in our APTIVATE clinical trial, reduced manufacturing costs, and related expenses. In the comparative period in 2023, tuspetinib program costs included the healthy volunteer study, which was completed in 2023. \n  * Program costs for luxeptinib decreased by approximately $873 thousand, primarily due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing activities. \n  * Program costs for APTO-253 decreased by approximately $2 thousand. The Company discontinued further clinical development of APTO-253. \n  * Personnel-related expenses decreased by $582 thousand, related to fewer employees in the current three-month period. \n  * Stock-based compensation decreased by approximately $340 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to stock options granted with lower grant date fair values in the current period and option forfeitures recorded in the current period. \n\n\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $12.0 million to $15.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $27.6 million for the comparative period in 2023. Changes to the components of our research and development expenses presented in the table above are primarily as a result of the following events:\n\n  * Program costs for tuspetinib were $10.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $8 million compared with $18.7 million for the comparative period in 2023. The lower program costs for tuspetinib in the current period represent the reduction of activity in our APTIVATE clinical trial, reduced manufacturing costs, and related expenses. In the comparative period in 2023, tuspetinib program costs included the healthy volunteer study, which was completed in 2023. \n  * Program costs for luxeptinib decreased by approximately $2.4 million to $287 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.6 million in the comparative period, primarily due to lower clinical trial and manufacturing activities. \n  * Program costs for APTO-253 decreased by approximately $15 thousand, due to the Company’s decision on December 20, 2021 to discontinue further clinical development of APTO-253. \n  * Personnel-related expenses decreased by $834 thousand, related to fewer employees in the current six-month period and partially offset by salary increases. \n  * Stock-based compensation decreased by approximately $865 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to stock options granted with lower grant date fair values, in the current period. \n\n\n\n**About Aptose**\n\nAptose Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing precision medicines addressing unmet medical needs in oncology, with an initial focus on hematology.
