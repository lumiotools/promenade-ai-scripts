This signals our entry into military markets and establishes our Iron Drone Raider system as a third revenue-generating technology platform in Ondas' portfolio. Ondas Networks is benefiting from increased visibility on Class I railroads' network plans and realized a significant milestone, with distribution partner Siemens securing an order from Metra, a transit rail operator serving passengers in Chicago.\n\n\"At Ondas Networks, we believe Metra's order for a system-wide upgrade of the 900 MHz wireless network to the new A-block with the jointly developed next-generation Advanced Train Control Systems (ATCS) platform confirms that Ondas Networks and Siemens have established a comprehensive deployment and migration plan to support adoption of the dot16 wireless standard by railroads in North America. That was further demonstrated during Q3 with Siemens' receipt of an additional order from a Class I Railroad for an expansion of an existing live 900 MHz network, also in Chicago. In short, we are demonstrating the robustness of the dot16 standard as we start 900 MHz upgrades in Chicago - the most complex railroad wireless environment in the country.\n\n\"Our exceptional efforts at OAS are translating into significant results as we have positioned the Iron Drone Raider system as a leading candidate to own the category for ‘hard kill' counter-uncrewed autonomous system (UAS) infrastructure. In addition, our Optimus System will now be deployed to secure military bases and border checkpoints, demonstrating the exceptional capabilities of this market-leading system in high value security markets. We see growing demand for aerial security and inspection from ‘drone-in-a-box' systems. As we scale with customers for military and public safety drone-as-a-first-responder (DFR) security applications with Optimus, we see evidence that security officials and project managers in military, public safety and critical industrial markets are increasingly appreciating OAS' ability to satisfy the most demanding requirements to secure and protect high value assets and locations.\"\n\nBrock concluded, \"Ondas remains in a strong position, with leading technology platforms addressing large, high value end markets and increased evidence of customer acceptance across both business units. Indeed, the third quarter represented the largest bookings quarter in Ondas' history. Further, we raised $10.5 million in capital between Ondas Holdings and our business units during both the third quarter and fourth quarter-to-date, demonstrating continued investor support. Our top line revenue has been delayed, mainly due to 900 MHz timeline extensions with Ondas Networks rail customers, and supply chain and market-related issues stemming from the Gaza conflict in Israel. Nonetheless, a strengthening order book and customer pipeline at OAS as well as improving engagement with the railroad customers at Ondas Networks bodes well for our outlook. I expect a strong end to 2024 and am optimistic about our ability to drive significant growth in 2025.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights** - **Ondas Networks**\n\n  * Generated approximately $445,000 in revenue during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n  * Secured $3.0 million in capital from Charles & Potomac Capital LLC (Charles & Potomac) in the third quarter and fourth quarter-to-date.\n\n  * Siemens secured a purchase order from Metra, the primary commuter rail system serving the Chicago metropolitan area, for Airlink dot-16 compliant wireless systems to upgrade the legacy 900 MHz ATCS network and migrate the network to the new 900 MHz A-block.\n\n  * Siemens secured a purchase order from a Class I rail operator for Airlink dot-16 compliant wireless systems to expand the final programs in advance of an expected upgrade of the legacy 900 MHz ATCS network and migration to the new 900 MHz A-block in Chicago.\n\n  * Achieved key development milestones, including the provision on initial prototype radios with our partner Siemens in the 220 MHz radio program on behalf of an Amtrak-sponsored upgrade to its Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES), a Positive Train Control (PTC) system utilized by passenger and transit, as well as certain freight rail operators in the Northeast Corridor (NEC). Product development is expected to be completed in Q1 2025, and commercial deliveries are slated for Q2 2025.\n\n  * Advanced development program for on-locomotive radios designed for European rail markets.\n\n  * Announced that Markus Nottelmann, an accomplished executive with significant railroad operations and financial experience, joined Ondas as a Senior Advisor and board member of Ondas Networks.\n\n  * Continuing engagement with MxV Rail regarding improved network operations and 802.16t applications. This work includes the Base Station Controller which enables the dynamic sharing of spectrum resources in 802.16t networks and a major testing program related to the use of 802.16t for next-generation HOT/EOT systems.\n\n  * Demonstrated the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz band to support the Interoperable Train Control Messaging (ITCM) protocol with multiple railroads and ecosystem vendors. ITCM is the primary transport for PTC messaging and 900 MHz provides an alternate path to improve network reliability and availability. Applications such as PTC, which were previously restricted to the 220 MHz network, can now be supported by the new 900 MHz network, adding resiliency, redundancy and diversity to critical railroad operations.\n\n  * Preparing for field trial by a Class I railroad in November to host ITCM over 900 MHz; a program which is being planned for expansion upon successful field activity.\n\n  * Submitted proposals for network equipment and development programs upon request from rail vendors for dot16 wireless network systems in international markets.\n\n  * Entered into a platform agreement with KLEAR Inc., a provider of working capital financing. Ondas Networks secured an initial $500,000 short-term working capital loan secured by customer invoices during October.\n\n  * Partnered with Siemens to exhibit at the Railway Systems Suppliers Inc. (RSSI) show in Louisville, Kentucky and hosted a subsequent \"Demo Day\" for key customers which featured a variety of general-purpose applications supported by an 802.16t wireless network. Demonstrations included the hosting of ITCM messaging over the new 900 MHz band, which can be deployed to eliminate single points of failure and support critical PTC redundancy of the 220 MHz network for train operating and safety systems.\n\n  * Submitted written testimony to members of the U.S. House of Representatives in advance of a hearing on rail safety matters held by the U.S. House of Representatives' Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials. The letter to the subcommittee was written in support of the Railroad wireless technology roadmap and the new 900 MHz network and its potential to support improved train safety and operations.\n\n\n\n\nGuy Simpson, Ondas Networks President and Chief Operating Officer, commented, \"Ondas Networks' visibility from our railroad customers is improving with respect to plans for the new 900 MHZ network. This is highlighted by the order received by Siemens from Metra for a planned system-wide 900 MHz upgrade to support their passenger operations in Chicago. The Metra order was followed by the expansion of a 900 MHz network for a Class I railroad, also in Chicago, that has been in live operation for nearly a year.\n\n\"In addition, we continue to see expanding application and network opportunities for our dot16 software defined networking capabilities. We advanced the PTC data radio program on behalf of Amtrak, which included delivering initial prototype radios. We also are engaged with the American Association of Railroads (AAR) on solutions shaping for next-generation Head-of-Train and End-of-Train (NGHE) systems as the industry seeks to enhance operational and safety systems supporting the operations of long trains. We believe Ondas Networks is well positioned to support the next-generation NGHE - targeted for the 450 MHz frequency band - and intended to improve the system supporting the safe operations of long trains.\"\n\nSimpson concluded, \"As we work to secure network buildout timelines and orders, we believe we have greater visibility into the freight railroads' roadmap plans for the 900 MHz A-block. We now expect the new 900 MHz network to serve as both a primary network for next-generation ATCS and Centralized Train Control (CTC) protocols, as well as a backup for CTC and PTC running ITCM protocols native to the 220 MHz network. This architecture, with inherent redundancy and the support of multiple applications on 900 MHz demonstrates the value of the dot16 wireless standard. We will continue to work closely with Siemens and railroad customers to support deployments in the 900 MHz network and to improve visibility in terms of orders and buildout plans for 2025.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights - Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS)**\n\n  * Generated approximately $1.0 million in revenue and secured $14.4 million in purchase orders during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n  * Secured $3.5 million in capital from investors including Privet Ventures LLC, an investment company owned by Eric Brock, and Charles & Potomac, an investment company owned by Ondas Board Member Joe Popolo.\n\n  * Airobotics secured several purchase orders from a major government military customer for the Iron Drone Raider system totaling $9 million. During July and August 2024, Airobotics received purchase orders for both initial deployment of new systems and for upgrades of the existing Iron Drone Raider system from this customer. In September 2024, Airobotics received a third order for operational deployment of the system in multiple locations, assisting in protecting national borders, military units and other critical assets from hostile drones.\n\n  * Airobotics secured a $5.4 million purchase order in September 2024 from a major government military customer for the Optimus System, with deployments intended to support the protection of critical assets at military bases and borders under challenging environmental conditions.\n\n  * Airobotics continued to expand its operations with a local governmental entity in Dubai in support of drone network infrastructure for public safety and other public services. The deployed fleet of Optimus Systems has been extensively utilized by the local government entity, with potential for additional orders expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n  * Airobotics continued expanding its market reach into Europe and will perform designated demonstrations for defense and critical infrastructure potential customers through reseller partnerships with HHLA Sky and C-Astral Aerospace in Germany, Slovenia, and other European countries.\n\n  * Airobotics received a $1.0 million grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority (IIA) to support further enhancements of the Iron Drone Raider in November.\n\n  * American Robotics secured and delivered a key contract with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) for maritime emissions monitoring to support Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Port initiatives at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, positioning American Robotics as a prime vendor for a U.S. federal agency.\n\n  * American Robotics demonstrated the Optimus System to key customers including a technology infrastructure provider in Texas. This demonstration showcased its capability to remotely operate drone fleets Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) by leveraging Optimus' FAA type certification and the Kestrel system.\n\n  * American Robotics is planning a major demonstration of its Optimus System in November for one of the largest public safety departments in the United States.\n\n  * American Robotics hosted an investor day at its Maryland Headquarters featuring the Iron Drone Raider and Optimus Systems demonstration and webinar.\n\n  * OAS entered into a strategic alliance with GenLab Venture Studio, a venture studio focused on integrated AI solutions, to develop go-to-market business models in specific verticals with the benefit of fused AI capabilities with the Optimus aerial security and inspection platform.\n\n\n\n\nOAS President Meir Kliner commented, \"OAS had a pivotal quarter as evidenced with bookings of over $14 million for our Optimus and Iron Drone systems via multiple orders from a major military customer. These orders came as a result of our continuous efforts to leverage the core advantages of our ‘built for purpose' platforms which include market-leading functionality and reliability. As we expand the markets for our dual-use platforms, we expect to benefit from strengthening demand as the world responds to both the value and potential threats of drones deployed in defense, public safety, and critical infrastructure markets.\n\n\"We are seeing significant interest in global defense markets for the Iron Drone Raider system and engagement from specific military customers. The Iron Drone Raider system is emerging as a best-in-class, 'hard kill' counter drone solution addressing the urgent need for protection from hostile drones. Similarly, demand for Optimus is strong in both defense and security markets and our customer pipeline is maturing. As we move forward, we are investing to expand our operating infrastructure to support what we believe will be an increase in orders and system deliveries in the months and quarters ahead for both Iron Drone and Optimus.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Revenues were approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of delays in order activity for product sales at Ondas Networks, partially offset by increases at OAS as we started to fulfill the new purchase orders received in the quarter.\n\nGross profit was approximately $0.05 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was approximately 3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This is due to the change in the mix of revenues in the third quarter of 2024, which included development projects with lower gross margins as compared to product revenue with higher gross margins in the third quarter of 2023, as well as certain fixed costs related to OAS service delivery. At this time, gross margins may be variable on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to low revenue levels and shifts in revenue mix between product, development, and services revenues.\n\nOperating expenses were approximately $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nCash operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $7.1 million, as compared to approximately $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cash operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, exclude non-cash operating items during the period, including $1.3 million in depreciation and amortization, and $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. For the three months ending September 30, 2023, cash operating expenses excluded $1.3 million in depreciation and amortization and the reversal of $2.3 million of stock-based compensation expense because of employees leaving the company before the stock awards vested. Cash operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nThe Company realized an operating loss of approximately $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet loss was approximately $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $7.1 million, as compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nThe Company held cash and restricted cash of approximately $2.9 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $15.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company expects to fund its operations from the cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, proceeds from financing activities, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that the Company may seek through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company raised an additional $3.55 million of capital which included $3.5 million via a convertible note at OAS, a transaction led by Privet Ventures and Charles & Potomac. Privet Ventures is an investment vehicle owned by Ondas' CEO Eric Brock.\n\n**Operational and Financial Outlook for 2024** The Company expects a recovery in revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 driven primarily by the OAS business unit as the Company fulfills backlog, which includes military orders secured in the third quarter. Revenue expectations for Ondas Networks are modest in the fourth quarter of 2024, and limited to funded development programs, given the current visibility on deployment plans in the 900 MHz network which point to growth in 2025.\n\nBookings and revenue growth are expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter given the uncertainty around the timing of customer activity in front of the targeted commercial rollout for the 900 MHz rail network, the development programs underway with Siemens, in addition to the timing of OAS's deliveries of the Optimus and Iron Drone systems to its growing roster of customers globally.\n\nLastly, Ondas has requested an additional 180-day compliance period from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of US$1.00 per share under Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550 (a) (2).\n\n**Earnings Conference Call & Audio Webcast Details**Date: Tuesday, November 12, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. Eastern timeToll-free dial-in number: 844-883-3907International dial-in number: 412-317-5798Call participant pre-registration link: [here](https://pr.report/46fu)\n\nThe Company encourages listeners to pre-register, which allows callers to gain immediate access and bypass the live operator.

Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses differently, and therefore our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses should only be used as supplemental measures of our operating performance.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax impacts and other adjustments as set out in the table below, which management has determined are not reflective of core operating activities and thereby assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses.\n\nWe believe that cash operating expenses is useful to manage expenses as it excludes non-cash items (depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense) that may obscure our underlying business performance.\n\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses in making financial, operating, and planning decisions and evaluating the Company's ongoing performance.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** Statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This signals our entry into military markets and establishes our Iron Drone Raider\nsystem as a third revenue-generating technology platform in Ondas' portfolio. Ondas\nNetworks is benefiting from increased visibility on Class I railroads' network plans and\nrealized a significant milestone, with distribution partner Siemens securing an order from\nMetra, a transit rail operator serving passengers in Chicago.\n\"At Ondas Networks, we believe Metra's order for a system-wide upgrade of the 900 MHz\nwireless network to the new A-block with the jointly developed next-generation Advanced\nTrain Control Systems (ATCS) platform confirms that Ondas Networks and Siemens have\nestablished a comprehensive deployment and migration plan to support adoption of the\ndot16 wireless standard by railroads in North America. That was further demonstrated during\nQ3 with Siemens' receipt of an additional order from a Class I Railroad for an expansion of\nan existing live 900 MHz network, also in Chicago. In short, we are demonstrating the\nrobustness of the dot16 standard as we start 900 MHz upgrades in Chicago - the most\ncomplex railroad wireless environment in the country.\n\"Our exceptional efforts at OAS are translating into significant results as we have positioned\nthe Iron Drone Raider system as a leading candidate to own the category for ‘hard kill'\ncounter-uncrewed autonomous system (UAS) infrastructure. In addition, our Optimus\nSystem will now be deployed to secure military bases and border checkpoints,\ndemonstrating the exceptional capabilities of this market-leading system in high value\nsecurity markets. We see growing demand for aerial security and inspection from ‘drone-in-\na-box' systems. As we scale with customers for military and public safety drone-as-a-first-\nresponder (DFR) security applications with Optimus, we see evidence that security officials\nand project managers in military, public safety and critical industrial markets are increasingly\nappreciating OAS' ability to satisfy the most demanding requirements to secure and protect\nhigh value assets and locations.\"\nBrock concluded, \"Ondas remains in a strong position, with leading technology platforms\naddressing large, high value end markets and increased evidence of customer acceptance\nacross both business units. Indeed, the third quarter represented the largest bookings\nquarter in Ondas' history. Further, we raised $10.5 million in capital between Ondas\nHoldings and our business units during both the third quarter and fourth quarter-to-date,\ndemonstrating continued investor support. Our top line revenue has been delayed, mainly\ndue to 900 MHz timeline extensions with Ondas Networks rail customers, and supply chain\nand market-related issues stemming from the Gaza conflict in Israel. Nonetheless, a\nstrengthening order book and customer pipeline at OAS as well as improving engagement\nwith the railroad customers at Ondas Networks bodes well for our outlook. I expect a strong\nend to 2024 and am optimistic about our ability to drive significant growth in 2025.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights - Ondas Networks\nGenerated approximately $445,000 in revenue during the third quarter of 2024.\nSecured $3.0 million in capital from Charles & Potomac Capital LLC (Charles &\nPotomac) in the third quarter and fourth quarter-to-date.\nSiemens secured a purchase order from Metra, the primary commuter rail system\nserving the Chicago metropolitan area, for Airlink dot-16 compliant wireless systems to\nupgrade the legacy 900 MHz ATCS network and migrate the network to the new 900\nMHz A-block.\nSiemens secured a purchase order from a Class I rail operator for Airlink dot-16\ncompliant wireless systems to expand the final programs in advance of an expected\nupgrade of the legacy 900 MHz ATCS network and migration to the new 900 MHz A-\nblock in Chicago.\nAchieved key development milestones, including the provision on initial prototype\nradios with our partner Siemens in the 220 MHz radio program on behalf of an Amtrak-\nsponsored upgrade to its Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES), a\nPositive Train Control (PTC) system utilized by passenger and transit, as well as\ncertain freight rail operators in the Northeast Corridor (NEC). Product development is\nexpected to be completed in Q1 2025, and commercial deliveries are slated for Q2\n2025.\nAdvanced development program for on-locomotive radios designed for European rail\nmarkets.\nAnnounced that Markus Nottelmann, an accomplished executive with significant\nrailroad operations and financial experience, joined Ondas as a Senior Advisor and\nboard member of Ondas Networks.\nContinuing engagement with MxV Rail regarding improved network operations and\n802.16t applications. This work includes the Base Station Controller which enables the\ndynamic sharing of spectrum resources in 802.16t networks and a major testing\nprogram related to the use of 802.16t for next-generation HOT/EOT systems.\nDemonstrated the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz band to support the Interoperable\nTrain Control Messaging (ITCM) protocol with multiple railroads and ecosystem\nvendors. ITCM is the primary transport for PTC messaging and 900 MHz provides an\nalternate path to improve network reliability and availability. Applications such as PTC,\nwhich were previously restricted to the 220 MHz network, can now be supported by the\nnew 900 MHz network, adding resiliency, redundancy and diversity to critical railroad\noperations.\nPreparing for field trial by a Class I railroad in November to host ITCM over 900 MHz; a\nprogram which is being planned for expansion upon successful field activity.\nSubmitted proposals for network equipment and development programs upon request\nfrom rail vendors for dot16 wireless network systems in international markets.\nEntered into a platform agreement with KLEAR Inc., a provider of working capital\nfinancing. Ondas Networks secured an initial $500,000 short-term working capital loan\nsecured by customer invoices during October.\nPartnered with Siemens to exhibit at the Railway Systems Suppliers Inc. (RSSI) show\nin Louisville, Kentucky and hosted a subsequent \"Demo Day\" for key customers which\nfeatured a variety of general-purpose applications supported by an 802.16t wireless\nnetwork. Demonstrations included the hosting of ITCM messaging over the new 900\nMHz band, which can be deployed to eliminate single points of failure and support\ncritical PTC redundancy of the 220 MHz network for train operating and safety\nsystems.\nSubmitted written testimony to members of the U.S. House of Representatives in\nadvance of a hearing on rail safety matters held by the U.S. House of Representatives'\nTransportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials. The\nletter to the subcommittee was written in support of the Railroad wireless technology\nroadmap and the new 900 MHz network and its potential to support improved train\nsafety and operations.\nGuy Simpson, Ondas Networks President and Chief Operating Officer, commented, \"Ondas\nNetworks' visibility from our railroad customers is improving with respect to plans for the new\n900 MHZ network. This is highlighted by the order received by Siemens from Metra for a\nplanned system-wide 900 MHz upgrade to support their passenger operations in Chicago.\nThe Metra order was followed by the expansion of a 900 MHz network for a Class I railroad,\nalso in Chicago, that has been in live operation for nearly a year.\n\"In addition, we continue to see expanding application and network opportunities for our\ndot16 software defined networking capabilities. We advanced the PTC data radio program\non behalf of Amtrak, which included delivering initial prototype radios. We also are engaged\nwith the American Association of Railroads (AAR) on solutions shaping for next-generation\nHead-of-Train and End-of-Train (NGHE) systems as the industry seeks to enhance\noperational and safety systems supporting the operations of long trains. We believe Ondas\nNetworks is well positioned to support the next-generation NGHE - targeted for the 450 MHz\nfrequency band - and intended to improve the system supporting the safe operations of long\ntrains.\"\nSimpson concluded, \"As we work to secure network buildout timelines and orders, we\nbelieve we have greater visibility into the freight railroads' roadmap plans for the 900 MHz A-\nblock. We now expect the new 900 MHz network to serve as both a primary network for\nnext-generation ATCS and Centralized Train Control (CTC) protocols, as well as a backup\nfor CTC and PTC running ITCM protocols native to the 220 MHz network. This architecture,\nwith inherent redundancy and the support of multiple applications on 900 MHz demonstrates\nthe value of the dot16 wireless standard. We will continue to work closely with Siemens and\nrailroad customers to support deployments in the 900 MHz network and to improve visibility\nin terms of orders and buildout plans for 2025.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights - Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS)\nGenerated approximately $1.0 million in revenue and secured $14.4 million in\npurchase orders during the third quarter of 2024.\nSecured $3.5 million in capital from investors including Privet Ventures LLC, an\ninvestment company owned by Eric Brock, and Charles & Potomac, an investment\ncompany owned by Ondas Board Member Joe Popolo.\nAirobotics secured several purchase orders from a major government military customer\nfor the Iron Drone Raider system totaling $9 million. During July and August 2024,\nAirobotics received purchase orders for both initial deployment of new systems and for\nupgrades of the existing Iron Drone Raider system from this customer. In September\n2024, Airobotics received a third order for operational deployment of the system in\nmultiple locations, assisting in protecting national borders, military units and other\ncritical assets from hostile drones.\nAirobotics secured a $5.4 million purchase order in September 2024 from a major\ngovernment military customer for the Optimus System, with deployments intended to\nsupport the protection of critical assets at military bases and borders under challenging\nenvironmental conditions.\nAirobotics continued to expand its operations with a local governmental entity in Dubai\nin support of drone network infrastructure for public safety and other public services.\nThe deployed fleet of Optimus Systems has been extensively utilized by the local\ngovernment entity, with potential for additional orders expected in the fourth quarter of\n2024.\nAirobotics continued expanding its market reach into Europe and will perform\ndesignated demonstrations for defense and critical infrastructure potential customers\nthrough reseller partnerships with HHLA Sky and C-Astral Aerospace in Germany,\nSlovenia, and other European countries.\nAirobotics received a $1.0 million grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority (IIA) to\nsupport further enhancements of the Iron Drone Raider in November.\nAmerican Robotics secured and delivered a key contract with the United States Coast\nGuard (USCG) for maritime emissions monitoring to support Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) Clean Port initiatives at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,\npositioning American Robotics as a prime vendor for a U.S. federal agency.\nAmerican Robotics demonstrated the Optimus System to key customers including a\ntechnology infrastructure provider in Texas. This demonstration showcased its\ncapability to remotely operate drone fleets Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) by\nleveraging Optimus' FAA type certification and the Kestrel system.\nAmerican Robotics is planning a major demonstration of its Optimus System in\nNovember for one of the largest public safety departments in the United States.\nAmerican Robotics hosted an investor day at its Maryland Headquarters featuring the\nIron Drone Raider and Optimus Systems demonstration and webinar.\nOAS entered into a strategic alliance with GenLab Venture Studio, a venture studio\nfocused on integrated AI solutions, to develop go-to-market business models in\nspecific verticals with the benefit of fused AI capabilities with the Optimus aerial\nsecurity and inspection platform.\nOAS President Meir Kliner commented, \"OAS had a pivotal quarter as evidenced with\nbookings of over $14 million for our Optimus and Iron Drone systems via multiple orders\nfrom a major military customer. These orders came as a result of our continuous efforts to\nleverage the core advantages of our ‘built for purpose' platforms which include market-\nleading functionality and reliability. As we expand the markets for our dual-use platforms, we\nexpect to benefit from strengthening demand as the world responds to both the value and\npotential threats of drones deployed in defense, public safety, and critical infrastructure\nmarkets.\n\"We are seeing significant interest in global defense markets for the Iron Drone Raider\nsystem and engagement from specific military customers. The Iron Drone Raider system is\nemerging as a best-in-class, 'hard kill' counter drone solution addressing the urgent need for\nprotection from hostile drones. Similarly, demand for Optimus is strong in both defense and\nsecurity markets and our customer pipeline is maturing. As we move forward, we are\ninvesting to expand our operating infrastructure to support what we believe will be an\nincrease in orders and system deliveries in the months and quarters ahead for both Iron\nDrone and Optimus.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenues were approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease\nwas primarily the result of delays in order activity for product sales at Ondas Networks,\npartially offset by increases at OAS as we started to fulfill the new purchase orders received\nin the quarter.\nGross profit was approximately $0.05 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to approximately $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was approximately 3% for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to 21% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. This is due to the change in the mix of revenues in the third quarter of 2024, which\nincluded development projects with lower gross margins as compared to product revenue\nwith higher gross margins in the third quarter of 2023, as well as certain fixed costs related to\nOAS service delivery. At this time, gross margins may be variable on a quarter-to-quarter\nbasis due to low revenue levels and shifts in revenue mix between product, development,\nand services revenues.\nOperating expenses were approximately $8.7 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, as compared to approximately $6.5 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023.\nCash operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were\napproximately $7.1 million, as compared to approximately $7.5 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Cash operating expenses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, exclude non-cash operating items during the period, including $1.3\nmillion in depreciation and amortization, and $0.3 million of stock-based compensation\nexpense. For the three months ending September 30, 2023, cash operating expenses\nexcluded $1.3 million in depreciation and amortization and the reversal of $2.3 million of\nstock-based compensation expense because of employees leaving the company before the\nstock awards vested. Cash operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company realized an operating loss of approximately $8.7 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nNet loss was approximately $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to a net loss of $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $7.1 million, as compared to an Adjusted EBITDA\nloss of $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure.\nThe Company held cash and restricted cash of approximately $2.9 million as of September\n30, 2024, as compared to approximately $15.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company expects to fund its operations from the cash on hand as of September 30,\n2024, proceeds from financing activities, gross profits generated from revenue growth,\npotential prepayments from customers for purchase orders, potential proceeds from warrants\nissued and outstanding, and additional funds that the Company may seek through equity or\ndebt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other\nsources.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company raised an additional $3.55 million of\ncapital which included $3.5 million via a convertible note at OAS, a transaction led by Privet\nVentures and Charles & Potomac. Privet Ventures is an investment vehicle owned by\nOndas' CEO Eric Brock.\nOperational and Financial Outlook for 2024\nThe Company expects a recovery in revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 driven\nprimarily by the OAS business unit as the Company fulfills backlog, which includes military\norders secured in the third quarter. Revenue expectations for Ondas Networks are modest in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, and limited to funded development programs, given the current\nvisibility on deployment plans in the 900 MHz network which point to growth in 2025.\nBookings and revenue growth are expected to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter given the\nuncertainty around the timing of customer activity in front of the targeted commercial rollout\nfor the 900 MHz rail network, the development programs underway with Siemens, in addition\nto the timing of OAS's deliveries of the Optimus and Iron Drone systems to its growing roster\nof customers globally.\nLastly, Ondas has requested an additional 180-day compliance period from The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement\nof US$1.00 per share under Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550 (a) (2).\nEarnings Conference Call & Audio Webcast Details\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024\nTime: 8:30 a.m. Eastern time\nToll-free dial-in number: 844-883-3907\nInternational dial-in number: 412-317-5798\nCall participant pre-registration link: here\nThe Company encourages listeners to pre-register, which allows callers to gain immediate\naccess and bypass the live operator.

Other\ncompanies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses differently, and\ntherefore our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other\ncompanies. Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses should only be used as\nsupplemental measures of our operating performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by removing\nthe impact of our capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base\n(depreciation and amortization), tax impacts and other adjustments as set out in the table\nbelow, which management has determined are not reflective of core operating activities and\nthereby assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses.\nWe believe that cash operating expenses is useful to manage expenses as it excludes non-\ncash items (depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation\nexpense) that may obscure our underlying business performance.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses in making financial,\noperating, and planning decisions and evaluating the Company's ongoing performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are\n\"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995.

(“Ondas Holdings”, “Ondas”, the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 22, 2014, under the name of\nZev Ventures Incorporated. On September 28, 2018, we acquired Ondas Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old Ondas Networks”), and changed our name to Ondas\nHoldings Inc. On August 5, 2021, we acquired American Robotics, Inc. (“American Robotics” or “AR”), a Delaware corporation. On January 23, 2023, we acquired Airobotics,\nLtd. (“Airobotics”), an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone systems. See Note 5 – Goodwill and Business Acquisition. On December 6, 2023, the Company formed\nOndas Autonomous Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation, as an intermediate holding company which now wholly-owns American Robotics and Airobotics. On August 8, 2024,\nthe Company filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, amending Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc.’s name to Ondas Autonomous\nSystems Inc. (“OAS”). On August 7, 2024, the Company formed Ondas Networks Texas Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Texas\nNetworks”). Pursuant to a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 19, 2024, Old Ondas Networks merged with and into Texas Networks (the “Merger”) with Texas\nNetworks being the surviving entity resulting from the Merger and shall continuing to exist and being governed by the laws of the State of Texas under the corporate name\n“Ondas Networks Inc.” (“Ondas Networks”).\nAs a result, Ondas Networks, OAS, American Robotics and Airobotics became our subsidiaries. Ondas’ corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts.\nOndas Networks has offices and facilities in Sunnyvale, California, American Robotics’ offices and facilities are located in Sparks, Maryland, and Airobotics’ offices and\nfacilities are located in Petah Tikva, Israel.\nBusiness Activity\nOndas is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks, OAS, Airobotics, and American\nRobotics. Ondas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics and American\nRobotics. Ondas Networks and OAS together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets with improved connectivity,\ndata collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks and OAS as separate business segments, and the following\nis a discussion of each segment.\nOndas Networks\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the\nMission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the\nvery edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial\nnetworks. Such applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security\nand government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area\nbroadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have targeted the North\nAmerican freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based\nnarrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new,\nintelligent train control and management systems. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the\nleading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are\npreferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets.\nAs such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.\n5\nOur software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet\nProtocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure\nmarkets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In\naddition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment\nsupporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of\nlarge industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated\nin our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field\nenabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.\nOndas Autonomous Systems (OAS)\nOur OAS business unit develops and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial\nenterprises. Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially available\nplatforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™,\na fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones. Airobotics acquired the assets of Iron Drone on March 6, 2023.\nOur unique, fully autonomous platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our\nbusiness focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense, Homeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other governmental entities together\nwith commercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil & Gas, Seaports, Mining, and Heavy Construction. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-\ntime aerial data capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field area operations, and\nhigh-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT\nimplementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.\nOur portfolio companies, American Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful\nAerospace business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing all the challenges arising\nalong these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing support.\nOAS and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type\nCertification (“TC”) from the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data\ncapture UAV to achieve this distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations over\npeople and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation\nwithin the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving\nFAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and\nworldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically transform critical operations with our\ncutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.\n6\nLiquidity\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had an\naccumulated deficit of approximately $226,032,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $2,217,000 net of debt discount\nand issuance costs of $0 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $30,751,000, net of debt discount and issuance cost of approximately $1,537,000 and a\nworking capital deficit of approximately $22,341,000.\nIn 2023, we raised approximately $14,692,000 of net proceeds from the sale of redeemable preferences shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to\nthird parties, and approximately $9,310,000 from a second convertible debt agreement. In the first nine months of 2024, we raised net proceeds of approximately $4,375,000\nfrom the sale of additional redeemable preferred shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, approximately $7,327,000 in net proceeds from\nissuing common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), of Ondas Holdings and warrants in OAS, approximately $2,860,000 in net proceeds from issuance of a\nsecured note and convertible note in Ondas Networks, and approximately $300,000 in government grant loans issued to Airobotics. On November 9, 2024, we entered into an\nagreement with Klear Inc., which provides for financing of accounts receivable, and we have financed approximately $500,000 so far at Ondas Networks.\nWe expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of September 30,\n2024, proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders,\npotential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes\npayable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been\nalleviated. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from November 12, 2024, the date the unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs\ninvolved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing\nactivities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate\nrevenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales\npipeline as well as new customers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned\nresearch and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and cash as expected in our current\nbusiness plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not\nknow whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on\ncommercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly\ndelayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”). The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). The Company’s\naccounting policies are described in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2023 Form 10-K and are updated, as necessary, in this Form 10-Q. The December\n31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet data presented for comparative purposes was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by\nU.S. GAAP. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year or for any other\nsubsequent interim period.\n7\nThe unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ondas Networks, American\nRobotics, and Airobotics. All inter-company accounts and transactions between these entities have been eliminated in these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The functional currency of the Company and all of our subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe utilize the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies\nare included in Ondas’ results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the\nacquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration\nliabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date; these are recorded in either other accruals within current liabilities (for expected payments in less\nthan a year) or other non-current liabilities (for expected payments in greater than a year), both on our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes to the fair value of\ncontingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Contingent consideration payments made soon after\nthe acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition\ndate that are related to the acquisition date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original\nacquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in certain\ncases, may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due\ndiligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets of an acquired business. The Company tests goodwill for\nimpairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist. The Company evaluates\nqualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform goodwill\nimpairment process.\nIntangible assets represent patents, licenses, software and allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business. The Company estimates\nthe fair value of its reporting units using the fair market value measurement requirement. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.\nWe amortize our intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis, over 3 years for software; 10 years for patents; 3-10 years for developed technology, 10\nyears for licenses, trademarks, marketing-related assets and the FAA waiver; 5 years for customer relationships; and 1 year for non-compete agreements.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The\nCompany determined it has two reportable segments: Ondas Networks and OAS as the CODM reviews financial information for these two businesses separately. The Company\nhas no inter-segment sales.\nUse of Estimates\nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such management estimates include those relating to allocation of\nconsideration for business combinations to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, revenue recognition, inventory write-downs to reflect net realizable value, assumptions\nused in the valuation of stock-based awards and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n8\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we had no cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes cash that is not readily available for use in the Company’s operating activities. Restricted cash is\nattributable to minimum cash reserve requirements for Airobotics’ credit cards. The Company periodically monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial\ninstitutions with which it invests. Periodically, throughout the nine months ended, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company has maintained balances in excess of Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was $1,981,898 in excess of FDIC insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for credit losses as well as net of any discounts or other forms of variable consideration. We\nestimate allowance for credit losses by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates our customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as\ncustomer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. We use assumptions and judgment, based on\nthe best available facts and circumstances, to record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These allowances are evaluated and adjusted\nas additional information is received. We had no allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nInventory\nInventories, which consist solely of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value, net of\nreserves for obsolete inventory. We continually analyze our slow-moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices,\nwe established reserves. Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand. Products\nthat are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 such reserves were $100,254.\nInventory consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw Material $ 4,146,010 $ 1,499,727\nWork in Process 351,068 782,770\nFinished Goods 4,481,910 4,403\nLess Inventory Reserves (100,254) (100,254)\nTotal Inventory, net $ 8,878,734 $ 2,186,646\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reclassed $2,289,539 of docking stations and drones, net into inventory, as OAS has shifted their focus from service revenue,\nselling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems, to product revenue, primarily selling their Optimus\nSystem™ and Iron Drone Raider™.\nProperty and Equipment\nAll additions, including improvements to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property\nand equipment is principally recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives typically are (i) 3 to 7 years for\ncomputer equipment, (ii) 5 years for vehicles and docking stations and drones, (iii) 7 – 17 years for furniture and fixtures, (iv) 5 to 7 years for development equipment, and (v)\n3 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nUpon the disposal of property, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the amounts recorded therein for such items, and any resulting gain or\nloss is recorded in operating expenses in the year of disposition.\n9\nSoftware\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product.\nOnce technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in\ndetermining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk\ndevelopment issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs\nis included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no internally developed software.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.\nSuch indicators include significant technological changes, adverse changes in market conditions and/or poor operating results. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is\nconsidered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying value. The amount of impairment loss recognized is the difference between the\nestimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate\ncommensurate with the risk involved. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nCosts for research and development are expensed as incurred except for research and development equipment with alternative future use. Research and development\nexpenses consist primarily of salaries, salary related expenses and costs of contractors and materials.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short- and long-\nterm debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate our fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. Our\nfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles, which are adjusted to fair value whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Our estimate of the fair value of right of use assets, goodwill and\nintangibles is based on expected future cash flows and actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe have categorized our assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nAssets and liabilities recorded in the balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 -- Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through\nmarket corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 -- Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n10\nThe Company had no Level 3 assets that are required to be valued at fair value as of September 30, 2024. The Company had Level 3 assets that are required to be\nvalued at fair value as of December 31, 2023, see Note – 2 Summary of Significant Account Policies, Leases, and Note 4 – Property and Equipment.\nThe Company had Level 3 liabilities that are required to be valued at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the government\ngrant liability is determined as the sum of 3% royalty payments on forecasted future sales, discounted using the effective interest method. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company made the following assumptions: (i) royalty payments will be made on future sales through 2027, and (ii) the effective interest rate is a range\nof 17-19%. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the Level 3 government grant liability measured at fair value using\nsignificant unobservable inputs:\nGovernment\nGrant\nLiability\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,749,704\nNet loss on change in fair value of liability 74,393\nBalance as of March 31, 2024 2,824,097\nGovernment grant proceeds received, adjusted to fair value 156,659\nNet gain on change in fair value of liability (623,410)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 2,357,346\nNet loss on change in fair value of liability 86,307\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 2,443,653\nDeferred Offering Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process equity financing as deferred\noffering costs until such financing is consummated. After consummation of equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of additional paid-in\ncapital generated as a result of the offering. Should the planned equity financing be abandoned, the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a charge to other\nincome (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Government grant liability was assumed through the acquisition of Airobotics and asset purchase of Iron Drone. Airobotics and Iron Drone received government\ngrants from the Israel Innovation Authority (formerly: the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel, “the IIA”), and the grant funds are repayable to the extent that future economic\nbenefits are expected from the research project that will result in royalty-bearing sales. A liability for grants received is first measured at fair value using a discount rate that\nreflects a market rate of interest. The difference between the amount of the grant received and the fair value of the liability is accounted for as a government grant and\nrecognized as a reduction of research and development expenses.\nAt each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether there is reasonable assurance that the liability recognized, in whole or in part, will not be repaid (since the\nCompany will not be required to pay royalties) based on the best estimate of future sales and using the original effective interest rate, which is 17-19%, and if so, the\nappropriate amount of the liability is derecognized through other income (expense). Amounts paid as royalties are treated as a reduction of the liability. Royalty payments are\ndue every nine months. There is no maturity date. The liability exists until it is paid in full through royalty payments or the Company reports to the IIA there will be no further\nsales, as per the terms of the agreement.\n11\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn 2023 and 2024, Ondas Networks Inc. entered into multiple agreements with a third party for the sale of redeemable preferred stock in Ondas Networks (see Note 10\n– Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest). The preferred stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (8%) of the original issue price and can be redeemed at the\nrequest of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary as follows:\n(i) In respect of the 2023 investments, for the greater of two times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Preferred\nStock was converted into Common Stock.\n(ii) In respect of the 2024 investment, for the greater of one times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Preferred Stock\nwas converted into Common Stock.\nThe applicable accounting guidance requires an equity instrument that is redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if it is\nredeemable (a) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (b) at the option of the holder, or (c) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the\ncontrol of the issuer. As a result, the Company recorded the noncontrolling interest as redeemable noncontrolling interest and classified it in temporary equity within its\nconsolidated balance sheet initially at its acquisition-date estimated redemption value or fair value. In addition, the Company has elected to accrete the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest to the full redemption value as of the earliest redemption date by accruing dividends at 8% per annum and accreting the redemption value to two and one\ntimes the initial investment, respectively, using the effective interest rate method.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nmeasured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect\non deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the\namount that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize the effect of uncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely\nthan not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized uncertain income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is\ngreater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both\ninterest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe calculate stock-based compensation expense for option awards (“Stock-based Award(s)”) based on the estimated grant/issue date fair value using the Black-\nScholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”) and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they\noccur.\nThe Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the\nvesting period in determining the fair value of Stock-based Awards. The expected term is based on the “simplified method”, due to the Company’s limited option exercise\nhistory. Under this method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term of the option award. As the Company does not\nyet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has identified several public entities of similar size, complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility\nbased on the volatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation expense are reasonable, these assumptions can\ninvolve complex judgments about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could\nsignificantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period.\n12\nWe recognize restricted stock unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. Compensation associated with shares of Common Stock\nissued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized over the expected service period beginning on the measurement date, which is generally the time\nthe Company and the service provider enter into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares in exchange for the services to be provided.\nShipping and Handling\nWe expense all shipping and handling costs as incurred. These costs are included in Cost of goods sold on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. We recognized expense of $19,542 and $87,073 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and expense of $61,303 and $145,504 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs are included in Sales and marketing on\nthe accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPost-Retirement Benefits:\nWe have one 401(k) Savings Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this 401(k) Plan, matching\ncontributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized expense of $56,325 and $60,684 for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $199,811 and $246,281 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAirobotics’ post-employment benefits are usually funded by deposits with insurance companies and are classified as defined deposit plans or defined benefit plans.\nAirobotics’ has defined deposit plans, in accordance with Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law, 1963, according to which Airobotics regularly makes its payments\nwithout having a legal or implied obligation to make additional payments even if the fund has not accumulated sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits, in the current\nperiod and in previous periods. Deposits to a defined benefit plan for severance pay or benefits, are recognized as an expense when deposited with the plan in parallel with\nreceiving work services from the employee. All of Airobotics’ employees in Israel are subject to Section 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law. We recognized expense of\n$211,392 and $154,862 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, $583,890 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $420,945 for the\nperiod of January 24, 2023 through September 30, 2023 related to these post-employment benefits.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, services, and development arrangements. We determine revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3)\ndetermination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone\nselling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when,\nor as, we satisfy a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is\nentitled to in exchange for the products or services it transfers to the customer.\nOndas has two business segments that generate revenue: Ondas Networks and OAS. Ondas Networks is engaged in the development, marketing, and sale of wireless\nradio systems for secure, wide area mission-critical, business-to-business networks. Ondas Networks generates revenue primarily from the sale of our FullMAX System and the\ndelivery of related services, along with non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) development projects with certain customers. OAS generates revenue through the sales of their\nOptimus System™, the Iron Drone Raider™, and separately priced support, maintenance and ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Optimus System™ and the\nIron Drone Raider™.\n13\nProduct Sales Revenue\nProduct revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon\ndelivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract, or upon installation when the combined performance obligation is not distinct within the context of the contract.\nOndas Networks’ software and hardware, and OAS’ Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™, are sold with a limited one-year basic warranty included in the price.\nThe limited one-year basic warranty is an assurance-type warranty, is not a separate performance obligation, and thus no transaction price is allocated to it. The nature of tasks\nunder the limited one-year basic warranty only provides for remedying defective product(s) covered by the warranty.\nService and Subscription Revenue\nService revenue is comprised of separately priced support and maintenance sales, as well as ancillary services, directly related to product sales, including product\ntraining, installation, and onsite support. Ancillary service revenues are recognized at the point in time when those services have been provided to the customer and the\nperformance obligation has been satisfied. The Company allocates the transaction price to the service based on the stand-alone selling prices of these performance obligations,\nwhich are stated in our contracts.\nOAS also generates service revenue by selling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems. The\ncustomer pays for a monthly, annual, or multi-annual subscription service to remotely access the data collected by their autonomous systems. Data subscription service revenue\nis recognized on straight line basis over the length of the customer subscription agreement. If a subscription payment is received prior to installation and operation of their\nautonomous systems, it is held in deferred revenue and recognized after operation commences over the length of the subscription service.\nDevelopment Revenue\nDevelopment revenue is comprised primarily of non-recurring engineering service contracts to develop software and hardware applications for various customers. For\nOndas Networks, in 2024 and 2023, a significant portion of this revenue is generated from one parent customer whereby Ondas Networks is to develop such applications to\ninteroperate within the customers infrastructure. For these contracts, Ondas Networks and the customers work cooperatively, whereby the customers’ involvement is to provide\ntechnical specifications for the product design, as well as, to review and approve the project progress at various markers based on predetermined milestones. The products\ndeveloped are not able to be sold to any other customer and are based in part upon existing Ondas Networks and customer technology. Development revenue is typically\nrecognized over time using a percentage of completion input method, whereby revenues are recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of satisfaction of the performance\nobligation based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. The input method is utilized because management considers it to be the best available measure of\nprogress as the performance obligations are completed.\nRevenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of revenue and cost of revenue\nare recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods base in the performance\ncompleted to date.\nPayment Terms\nOndas Networks’ payment terms vary and range from Net 15 to Net 30 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. OAS’s payment\nterms vary and range from Net 30 days to Net 60 days from the date of the invoices for product and services related revenue. Payment terms for the majority of development\nrelated revenue carry milestone-related payment obligations which span the contract life. For milestone-based development contracts, the customer reviews the completed\nmilestone and once approved, makes payment pursuant to the applicable contract.\n14\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We\naccount for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations\narrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold\nseparately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price\nconsidering available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. If a contract contains a single\nperformance obligation, no allocation is required.\nContract Modification\nContracts that are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements are assessed to determine if the modification either creates new or\nchanges the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, contract modifications are for products or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the\ninability to use, consume or sell the products or services on their own to generate economic benefits and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The\neffect of a contract modification on the transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue\n(either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no modifications to\ncontract specifications.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables present our disaggregated revenues by type of revenue, timing of revenue, and revenue by country:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nType of Revenue:\nProduct revenue $ 150,668 $ 2,180,472 $ 175,426 $ 8,880,309\nService and subscription revenue 887,747 234,236 1,495,887 1,289,642\nDevelopment revenue 442,377 250,482 1,392,339 560,194\nTotal revenue $ 1,480,792 $ 2,665,190 $ 3,063,652 $ 10,730,145\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTiming of Revenue:\nRevenue recognized point in time $ 881,004 $ 2,296,035 $ 1,172,969 $ 9,818,302\nRevenue recognized over time 599,788 369,155 1,890,683 911,843\nTotal revenue $ 1,480,792 $ 2,665,190 $ 3,063,652 $ 10,730,145\n15\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCountry of Revenue, based on location services were provided or product was shipped to:\nUnited States $ 567,838 $ 2,430,954 $ 1,319,585 $ 5,081,152\nUnited Arab Emirates 346,438 85,268 598,525 5,320,792\nUnited Kingdom 45,323 - 311,206 -\nIsrael 521,193 148,968 824,336 328,201\nIndia - - 10,000 -\nTotal revenue $ 1,480,792 $ 2,665,190 $ 3,063,652 $ 10,730,145\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe recognize a receivable or contract asset when we perform a service or transfer a good in advance of receiving consideration. A receivable is recorded when our\nright to consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. A contract asset is recorded when we have\nrecognized revenue over time in accordance with meeting our performance obligation but are unable to invoice the customer yet based on the contractual invoicing terms. The\ncontract asset is reclassified to a receivable when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. The table below details the activity in our contract assets during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Contract assets are included in Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNine Months\nEnded Year Ended\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 819,107 $ -\nContract assets recognized 214,145 928,995\nReclassification to Accounts receivable, net (641,043) (109,888)\nBalance at end of period $ 392,209 $ 819,107\nWe recognize a contract liability when we receive consideration, or if we have the unconditional right to receive consideration, in advance of satisfying the\nperformance obligation. A contract liability is our obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration, or an amount of\nconsideration is due from the customer. The table below details the activity in our contract liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nNine Months\nEnded Year Ended\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 276,944 $ 61,508\nAdditions, net 1,262,451 2,438,655\nTransfer to revenue (1,091,675) (2,223,219)\nBalance at end of period $ 447,720 $ 276,944\nRevenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liability opening balance was $159,400.\nWarranty Reserve\nFor our software and hardware products, we provide a limited one-year assurance-type warranty and for our development service, we provide no warranties. The\nassurance-type warranty covers defects in material and workmanship only. If a software or hardware component is determined to be defective after being tested by the\nCompany within the one-year, the Company will repair, replace or refund the price of the covered hardware and/or software to the customer (not including any shipping,\nhandling, delivery or installation charges). We estimate, based upon a review of historical warranty claim experience, the costs that may be incurred under our warranties and\nrecord a liability in the amount of such estimate at the time a product is sold. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated\nrates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the accrual as claims data and historical\nexperience warrants. The Company has assessed the costs of fulfilling its existing assurance-type warranties and has determined that the estimated outstanding warranty\nobligation on September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023 are immaterial to the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n16\nLeases\nUnder Topic 842, operating lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s\noperating leases consisted of office spaces in Sunnyvale, CA, Marlborough, MA (the “American Robotics Lease”), Waltham, MA (the “Waltham Lease”), and Petah Tikva,\nIsrael (the “Airobotics Leases”).\nOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a 24-month lease (effective April 1, 2021) with the owner and landlord (the “2021 Gibraltar Lease”), wherein the base rate is\n$45,000 per month, with a security deposit in the amount of $90,000. On April 1, 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Gibraltar Lease to extend the lease through September\n30, 2023, wherein the base rate is $65,676 per month. On November 6, 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Gibraltar Lease, as amended to further extend the lease through\nJune 30, 2024, wherein the base rate is $68,959 per month.\nOn August 7, 2023, Ondas Networks entered into a 72-month lease agreement with the owner and landlord of office space in Sunnyvale, CA (the “Oakmead Lease”).\nThe Oakmead Lease commenced on October 1, 2023, and is an operating lease through September 30, 2029. Base rent is $77,533 per month, increasing approximately 3%\nannually, with a security deposit due in the amount of $269,428. Base rent is abated during the first twelve months of the term of the lease.\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company acquired American Robotics and the American Robotics Lease, located in Marlborough, Massachusetts, wherein the base rate is\n$15,469 per month, with an annual increase of 3% through January 2024, with a security deposit of $24,166. On August 19, 2021, American Robotics amended the American\nRobotics Lease to reduce their space to approximately 10,450 square feet. The amendment reduced their annual base rent to $8,802 per month, with an annual increase of 3%\nthrough January 31, 2024. On November 10, 2023, American Robotics amended the American Robotics Lease, as amended to extend the existing lease term from January 31,\n2024 to January 31, 2026 and to relinquish a portion of the leased outdoor space. The annual base rent is $14,586 per month starting February 1, 2024, with an annual increase\nof 3.5% through January 2026. Effective September 30, 2024, the lease was terminated. The Company wrote off the remaining operating lease liability and right of use asset\nand recognized a gain on lease termination of $12,256, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOn October 8, 2021, American Robotics entered into an 86-month operating lease for space in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Waltham Lease commenced on March 1,\n2022, and is scheduled to terminate on April 30, 2029, wherein the base rate is $39,375 per month, increasing 3% annually, with a security deposit due in the amount of\n$104,040.\nOn January 15, 2024, American Robotics entered into an agreement to sublet their full leased space, leasehold improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in\nWaltham, Massachusetts through April 30, 2029, the remaining lease term, for $22,920 per month from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025, then $41,250 per month from May\n1, 2025 through April 30, 2029. The sublease is an operating lease. This event indicated that the carrying amount of the right of use asset, leasehold improvements, and\nremaining furniture and fixtures in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Asset Group”) may not be recoverable. The Asset Group was tested for recoverability as of December 31,\n2023 using the undiscounted cash flows from the sublease and the Company found the Asset Group to be impaired. The Company determined the Level 3 fair value of the Asset\nGroup using the sum of future cash flows from the sublease, discounted to the present value using an assumed discount rate of 10.5%. Based on this valuation, the Company\nrecognized an impairment charge of $1,383,536 related to the right of use asset associated with this Asset Group in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There was no indication of impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n17\nOn January 23, 2023, the Company acquired Airobotics and the Airobotics Leases, which includes office space in Petah Tikva, Israel leased according to three\ndifferent lease agreements. Each agreement is with respect to different sections of the entire leased area and are in effect through December 31, 2023, February 28, 2024, and\nNovember 30, 2024 wherein the base rate of the entire leased area is approximately $20,500 per month. The expired leases are being accounted for on a month-to-month basis.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. If we determine that the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease,\nat lease inception, we then determine whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in recording a right of use (“ROU”) asset and\nlease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to\nmake lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments\nover the lease term. For purposes of calculating operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, we use the non-cancellable lease term plus options to extend that we\nare reasonably certain to take. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our leases generally do not provide an\nimplicit rate. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThis rate is generally consistent with the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our credit facilities, as this rate approximates our collateralized borrowing capabilities over a\nsimilar term of the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of\nunderlying assets. We have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for any class of underlying asset.\nLease Costs\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nComponents of total lease costs:\nOperating lease expense $ 263,714 $ 224,126 $ 803,026 $ 787,833\nCommon area maintenance expense 106,013 38,242 401,296 129,348\nShort-term lease costs (1) 152,504 248,494 719,826 548,465\nTotal lease costs $ 522,231 $ 510,862 $ 1,924,148 $ 1,465,646\n(1) Represents short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, which are immaterial.\nLease Positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nROU lease assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets:\nOperating lease assets $ 3,799,014 $ 4,701,865\nTotal lease assets $ 3,799,014 $ 4,701,865\nLiabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities, current $ 771,943 $ 685,099\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current 5,254,623 5,800,710\nTotal lease liabilities $ 6,026,566 $ 6,485,809\n18\nOther Leases Information\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating cash flows for operating leases $ 684,668 $ 799,305\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) – operating lease 4.72 5.13\nWeighted average discount rate – operating lease 9.93% 5.76%\nUndiscounted Leases Cash Flows\nFuture lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, for the\nfollowing five years and thereafter are as follows:\nYears ending December 31,(1)\n2024 (3 months) $ 87,876\n2025 1,618,215\n2026 1,638,859\n2027 1,568,688\n2028 1,616,022\nThereafter 999,204\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 7,528,864\nLess imputed interest (1,502,298)\nTotal $ 6,026,566\n(1) Remaining non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025, 2026 - 2028, and 2029 of $68,760, $412,515, $495,000, and $165,000,\nrespectively, are not included in the table above.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of Common\nStock outstanding for each period (the denominator). Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting the dividends accumulated for the period on\ncumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from net income.\nThe computation of diluted net loss per share is similar to the computation of basic net loss per share except that the numerator may have to adjust for any dividends\nand income or loss associated with potentially dilutive securities that are assumed to have resulted in the issuance of shares of Common Stock, and the denominator may have\nto adjust to include the number of additional shares of Common Stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of Common Stock had been issued\nduring the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from shares of Common Stock issuable through stock options, warrants, restricted stock units, or convertible\npreferred stock. For purposes of determining diluted earnings per common share, the treasury stock method is used for stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units, and\nthe if-converted method is used for convertible preferred stock as prescribed in ASC Topic 260. Because of the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, the impact of including this in our computation of diluted net loss per share was anti-dilutive.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\n19\nThree and Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nWarrants to purchase Common Stock 26,490,210 12,566,092\nOptions to purchase Common Stock 4,687,865 4,845,049\nPotential shares issuable under 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes 56,958,660 29,319,723\nPotential shares issuable under 2023 Additional Notes 29,787,651 28,908,377\nRestricted stock units 118,419 175,064\nTotal potentially dilutive securities 118,042,805 75,814,305\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. Cash is deposited with a limited number of\nfinancial institutions. The balances held at any one financial institution may be in excess of FDIC insurance limits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was $1,981,898 in\nexcess of FDIC insured limits.\nCredit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support\naccounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Customers\nBecause we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our\nrevenue. Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was composed of three customers accounting for 30%, 27%, and 23% of the\nCompany’s revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Revenue from significant customers was composed of four customers accounting for\n45%, 19%, 13% and 12% of the Company’s revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Revenue was composed of one customer accounting for\n91% of the Company’s revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue from significant customers was composed of three customers\naccounting for 47%, 31% and 18% of the Company’s revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAccounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of the total accounts receivable, were composed of four customers accounting for\n38%, 21%, 18%, and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024. Three customers accounted for 61%, 22% and 12%,\nrespectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2023.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn September 30, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) No. 2022-03, which (1) clarifies existing\nguidance when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and (2) introduces new disclosure\nrequirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part\nof the unit of account of the equity security. Instead, the contractual sale restriction is a characteristic of the reporting entity. Accordingly, an entity should not consider the\ncontractual sale restriction when measuring the equity security’s fair value. Additionally, the ASU clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and\nmeasure a contractual sale restriction. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this pronouncement as of January 1, 2024 did not have a material impact on our accompanying unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, which incorporates 14 of the 27 disclosures referred to by the SEC in their SEC Release No. 33-10532,\nDisclosure Update and Simplification, issued on August 17, 2018. The amendments in this ASU modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the\nCodification and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected Topics unless otherwise indicated. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively.\nFor public business entities, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-\nK becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company has evaluated the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-03, and it is not expected to have an impact on\nthe Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n20\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which amends and\nenhances the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. All disclosure requirements under this standard will also be required for public entities with a single reportable\nsegment. The new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, “Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets”, which amends and enhances the disclosure requirements\nfor crypto assets. The new requirements will be effective for public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company has evaluated the\neffects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-08, and it is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires companies to provide disaggregated information\nabout a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new requirements will be effective for public business entities for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 3 – OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nOther current assets consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nPrepaid insurance $ 709,289 $ 1,035,071\nAdvance to vendors 671,818 442,727\nContract asset 392,209 819,107\nVAT Input Credit 202,162 232,048\nSublease receivable 173,053 -\nReceivables from employees - 40,117\nOther prepaid expenses and current assets 392,209 398,549\nTotal other current assets $ 2,540,740 $ 2,967,619\nNOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nVehicles $ 149,916 $ 149,916\nComputer equipment 423,501 363,141\nFurniture and fixtures 334,580 332,804\nLeasehold improvements 3,625,399 2,534,014\nDevelopment equipment 456,686 294,288\nDocking stations and drones 1,012,946 3,928,958\nMachinery and equipment 67,821 60,321\nConstruction in progress - 395,340\nTotal property and equipment 6,070,849 8,058,782\nLess: accumulated depreciation (3,336,528) (3,882,824)\nNet property and equipment $ 2,734,321 $ 4,175,958\n21\nDepreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $190,332 and $235,999, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, there was $619,793 of net property and equipment located in Israel.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reclassed $2,289,539 of docking stations and drones, net into inventory, as OAS has shifted their focus from service revenue,\nselling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems, to product revenue, primarily selling their Optimus\nSystem™ and Iron Drone Raider™.\nIn connection with the American Robotics sublease effective January 15, 2024, see Note – 2 Summary of Significant Account Policies, Leases, the Company recorded\nan impairment charge of $1,127,769, related to the Leasehold improvements and Furniture and fixtures associated with the Asset Group, was recognized in Operating expenses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ending December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There was no indication of impairment for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 5 – GOODWILL AND BUSINESS ACQUISITION\nWe account for acquisitions in accordance with FASB ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), and goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —\nGoodwill and Other” (“ASC 350”). The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination is recorded as goodwill.\nAirobotics Transaction\nOn January 23, 2023, the Company, completed the acquisition of Airobotics, pursuant to the Agreement of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2022 (the “Original\nAirobotics Agreement”), and that certain Amendment to Agreement of Merger, dated November 13, 2022 (the “Airobotics Amendment,” and together with the Original\nAirobotics Agreement, the “Airobotics Agreement”), by and among the Company, Talos Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger\nSub”), and Airobotics. In accordance with the terms of the Airobotics Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Airobotics (the “Merger”), with Airobotics continuing as\nthe surviving company of the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each ordinary share of Airobotics, par value NIS 0.01 per share (the “Airobotics Ordinary Shares”), issued\nand outstanding (other than shares owned by Airobotics or its subsidiaries (dormant or otherwise) or by the Company or Merger Sub) was converted into, and exchanged for\n0.16806 (the “Exchange Ratio”) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Company Common Stock, without interest and subject to applicable tax\nwithholdings (“Merger Consideration”). All fractional shares of the Company Common Stock that would have otherwise been issued to a holder of Airobotics Ordinary Shares\nas part of the Merger Consideration were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on the total number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock issued to such holder of\nAirobotics Ordinary Shares. Holders of Airobotics Ordinary Shares received approximately 2.8 million shares as consideration (excluding approximately 1.7 million shares\nunderlying equity awards to be outstanding following the Merger).\nAs provided in the Airobotics Agreement, each outstanding option, warrant or other right, whether vested or unvested, to purchase Airobotics Ordinary Shares (each,\nan “Airobotics Stock Option,” and collectively, the “Airobotics Stock Options”) issued pursuant to the Airobotics Ltd. 2015 Israeli Share Option Plan and 2020 Incentive\nEquity Plan (the “Airobotics Plans”), was assumed by Ondas and converted as of the Effective Time into an option, warrant or right, as applicable, to purchase shares of\nCompany Common Stock. Subject to the terms of the relevant Airobotics Stock Option, each Airobotics Stock Option is deemed to constitute an option, warrant, or other right,\nas applicable, to purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Airobotics Stock Option, a number of shares of Company Common\nStock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) that the holder of such Airobotics Stock Option would have been\nentitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option, warrant, or right to purchase full Airobotics Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Effective\nTime at a price per share of Company Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the former per share exercise price for Airobotics Ordinary Shares\notherwise purchasable pursuant to such Airobotics Stock Option, divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.\n22\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company is dual listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). The first trading day of the Company’s\nshares on TASE was January 26, 2023. On February 8, 2024, the Company took steps to voluntarily delist the Company’s Common Stock from trading on TASE. Pursuant to\nIsraeli law, the delisting of the Company’s Common Stock is expected to take effect three months following the date of the Company’s request to the TASE to delist the\nCompany’s Common Stock, which occurred on February 8, 2024. The Company’s Common Stock was voluntarily delisted from the TASE on May 9, 2024. The Company’s\nCommon Stock will continue to be listed for trading on Nasdaq, and all of the shares traded on the TASE are expected to be transferred to Nasdaq where they can continue to be\ntraded. See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 8, 2024 for further details.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid for Airobotics and the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the estimated fair value of the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nPurchase price consideration:\nCommon Stock – 2,844,291 Shares $ 5,261,938\nVested Stock Options – 605,349 Shares 700,690\nWarrants – 586,440 Warrants to purchase shares -\nTotal purchase price consideration $ 5,962,628\nEstimated fair value of assets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,049,454\nAccounts receivable 112,245\nInventory 1,494,707\nOther current assets 835,664\nProperty and equipment 3,015,602\nRight of use asset 339,104\nIntangible assets 5,977,926\nOther long-term assets 62,851\nTotal estimated fair value of assets acquired 12,887,553\nEstimated fair value of liabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable 969,242\nCustomer Prepayments 1,602,535\nGovernment grant liability 1,783,403\nOther loans 1,140,301\nOther payables 1,156,057\nLease liabilities 385,450\nLoan from related party 2,032,875\nTotal estimated fair value of liabilities assumed 9,069,863\nNet Assets Acquired $ 3,817,690\nGoodwill $ 2,144,938\nThe exercise price of the warrants included in the purchase price consideration far exceeded the Company’s stock price at the date of acquisition, thus the value of\nwarrants was deemed de minimis.\nThe intangible assets acquired include the developed technology, marketing-related assets, and customer relationships (see Note 6 – Intangible Assets). The final\npurchase price allocation has changed from the preliminary allocation because of changes in the valuation of property and equipment and intangibles. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, measurement period adjustments were made of (1) $68,483 to reduce the estimated fair value of property and equipment and increase goodwill,\nrespectively, and (2) $80,000 to reduce the valuation of the customer relationships intangible asset and increase goodwill, respectively.\n23\nGoodwill represents the assembled workforce, acquired capabilities, and future economic benefits resulting from the acquisition. No portion of the goodwill is\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nOur results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, include results from Airobotics between January 24, 2023 and September 30, 2023. The following\nunaudited pro forma information presents the Company’s results of operations as if the acquisition of Airobotics had occurred on January 1, 2023. The pro forma results do not\npurport to represent what the Company’s results of operations actually would have been if the transactions had occurred on January 1, 2023 or what the Company’s operating\nresults will be in future periods.\n(Unaudited)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenue, net $ 3,063,652 $ 10,762,181\nNet loss $ (25,579,810) $ (31,133,911)\nBasic Earnings Per Share $ (0.41) $ (0.61)\nDiluted Earnings Per Share $ (0.41) $ (0.61)\nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Company has recognized goodwill as part of the American Robotics acquisition in 2021 and Airobotics acquisition in 2023. The changes in the carrying amount of\ngoodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, are as follows:\nOAS\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ 25,606,983\nGoodwill acquired 2,144,938\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 $ 27,751,921\nGoodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process. In December 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative analysis and\nproceeded directly to a quantitative analysis. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the OAS reporting unit. Using a discounted cash\nflow analysis and updated forecasts for revenue and cash flows, it was determined that the fair value of the OAS reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and no impairment to goodwill was necessary as of December 31, 2023.\nNOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe components of intangible assets, all of which are finite lived, were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Net Gross Net\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Carrying Accumulated Carrying Useful\nAmount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount Life\nPatents $ 162,718 $ (52,896) $ 109,822 $ 117,810 $ (43,153) $ 74,657 10\nPatents in process 119,361 - 119,361 142,239 - 142,239 N/A\nLicenses 241,909 (108,000) 133,909 241,909 (89,859) 152,050 10\nSoftware 244,089 (196,778) 47,311 211,411 (167,412) 43,999 3\nTrademarks 3,230,000 (1,018,478) 2,211,522 3,230,000 (776,235) 2,453,765 10\nFAA waiver 5,930,000 (1,869,838) 4,060,162 5,930,000 (1,425,101) 4,504,899 10\nDeveloped technology 27,977,331 (7,831,419) 20,145,912 27,977,331 (5,632,170) 22,345,161 3 - 10\nNon-compete agreements 840,000 (840,000) - 840,000 (840,000) - 1\nMarketing-related assets 890,000 (149,290) 740,710 890,000 (82,540) 807,460 10\nCustomer relationships 1,010,000 (356,548) 653,452 1,010,000 (205,048) 804,952 5\n$ 40,645,408 $ (12,423,247) $ 28,222,161 $ 40,590,700 $ (9,261,518) $ 31,329,182\n24\nAmortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,056,141 and $1,064,798, respectively.

On July 11, 2018, the Company’s Board approved certain changes to the 2017 Convertible Promissory Note wherein the conversion feature\nwas changed from unilateral to mutual between the individual and the Company.\nThe Company may at any time on or after a qualified public offering convert any unpaid repayment at the IPO conversion price. The conversion price is the lesser of\nthe (i) price per share of Common Stock sold in the Qualified Public Offering, discounted by 20%, and (ii) the price per share of Common Stock based on a pre-money\nCompany valuation of $50 million on a Fully Diluted Basis.\nOn both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total outstanding balance of the 2017 Convertible Promissory Note was $300,000.

The fair value of the warrants was recorded as debt discount. (See Note 8 – Notes Payable for further details).\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock of the Company\nWe use the Black-Scholes Model to determine the fair value of warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company. The Black-Scholes Model is an acceptable\nmodel in accordance with U.S GAAP. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-\nfree interest rate, and the weighted average term of the warrant.\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of\nthe warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award.

A\nvaluation allowance of $68.9 million was provided against this asset resulting in deferred assets, net of valuation allowance of $0.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks had Federal NOLs of approximately $1 million and $15 million, respectively, generated in 2007 to 2017\nwhich will begin to expire in 2027 through 2037. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks had Federal NOLs of $59 million and $50 million,\nrespectively, generated in 2018 through 2023 that have no expiration. As of December 31, 2023, the Company and Ondas Networks had State NOLs available to offset future\ntaxable income of $43 million and $92 million, respectively, expiring from 2038 through 2043. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $127 million of\nIsraeli NOL’s. The Company’s Federal income tax returns for the 2020 to 2022 tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Upon utilization of Federal NOLs in the\nfuture, the IRS may examine records from the year the loss occurred, even if outside the three-year statute of limitations. The Company’s State tax returns also remain open to\nexamination. The Company’s Israeli income tax returns for the 2019 to 2022 tax years remain open to examination.\n38\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, including the net operating loss carry forwards, the Company assesses the positive and negative evidence to\nestimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize its existing deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the period when those temporary differences become deductible. Based on its assessment, the Company has provided a full\nvaluation allowance against its deferred tax assets since their future utilization remains uncertain at this time.\nIn accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the usage of the Company’s net operating loss carry forwards could be limited in the event a change of\ncontrol has occurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Company completed an analysis and determined that there were multiple ownership changes. Provided sufficient taxable\nincome is generated the annual base limitation plus increased limitation calculated pursuant to IRS Notice 2003-65 will allow the Company to utilize all existing losses within\nthe carryover periods.\nThe Company applies the FASB’s provisions for uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes the two-step process to determine the amount of recognized tax benefit.\nFor tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of income tax expense.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions that would require it to\nmeasure and reflect the potential lack of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate its uncertain tax positions in\nfuture periods to determine if measurement and recognition in its financial statements is necessary. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its\nunrecognized tax positions over the next year.\nNOTE 14 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owed $37,500 and $22,500 to independent directors, respectively, related to accrued compensation,\nwhich is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNetworks Convertible Notes (See Note 8 – Notes Payable)\nOn July 8, 2024 and July 23, 2024, C&P elected to purchase Convertible Notes in the aggregate original principal amount of $700,000 and $800,000, respectively, (the\n“Networks Convertible Notes”).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis provide information which our management believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of\noperations and financial condition of Ondas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas,” “we” or the “Company”). This discussion should be read together with our unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the notes included therein, which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Report”). This information should also be\nread in conjunction with the information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024, including the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023\n(“2023 Form 10-K”). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a description of factors that may cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, please refer to the below section of this Report titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements.” The reported results will not necessarily reflect future results of operations or financial condition.\nOverview\nOndas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas Holdings,” “Ondas,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions\nthrough its subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc., a Texas corporation (“Ondas Networks”) and Ondas Autonomous Systems Inc., a Nevada corporation (“OAS”), which wholly-\nowns Airobotics, Ltd., an Israeli company (“Airobotics”), and American Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“American Robotics” or “AR”). On August 8, 2024, the\nCompany filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, amending Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc.’s name to Ondas Autonomous\nSystems Inc.\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions. OAS provides drone and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Airobotics and American\nRobotics. Ondas Networks and OAS together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets with improved connectivity,\ndata collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks and OAS as separate business segments, and the following\nis a discussion of each segment. See Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information\nregarding our segments.\nOndas Networks Segment\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services. We refer to these applications as the\nMission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our wireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at the\nvery edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to process large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial\nnetworks. Such applications are required in all of the major critical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security\nand government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and ensure a high degree of safety and security.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area\nbroadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have targeted the North\nAmerican freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based\nnarrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new,\nintelligent train control and management systems. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the\nleading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are\npreferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets.\nAs such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.\n42\nOur software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet\nProtocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure\nmarkets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In\naddition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment\nsupporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of\nlarge industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated\nin our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field\nenabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.\nPartnership with Siemens and Market Advancements\nOndas Networks and Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”), have a strategic partnership, to both market our FullMAX-based networking technology and services and to\njointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our\nFullMAX MC-IoT platform.\nWe believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global rail market beginning with\nthe North American Class I Railroad market. We have a jointly-developed product with Siemens – the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems, and Siemens is marketing and\nselling our proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS radio systems support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS\nradios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications,\nincluding Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed\nto increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks’ standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the\nSiemens Airlink brand.\nWe developed a new radio for the Head of Train (HOT) Market in North America and a similar product for the Indian rail market. Siemens delivered these 900 MHz\nrail orders for a major Class I Railroad in the United States and received HOT orders for the Indian market.\nOndas and Siemens developed a new locomotive radio to support European Railroads. We secured an initial volume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz\nNetwork consisting of both ATCS compatible products along with Ondas’ catalog products. We received government authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada and, along\nwith Siemens, launched our joint effort for the European market at Innotrans in Berlin. Siemens and Ondas demonstrated our over the air compatibility to systems used by\npassenger rails in the Northeast Corridor of the US.\nIn March 2023 the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) formally announced that IEEE 802.16 standard would be the wireless platform for the greenfield 900\nMHz network. In April 2023, the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) voted to require the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz greenfield\nband; The AAR also confirmed they have agreed with the Federal Communications Committee to retire the legacy 900 MHz band by September 2025 and that the wireless\nnetwork in the new 900 MHz band would be substantially built by April 2026. In May and June 2023, we responded to RFPs to passenger rail customers in the Northeast\nCorridor. In February 2024, Siemens was selected by Amtrak to deliver their next generation radio based on Ondas’ FullMAX technology and the 802.16 standard.\n43\nOur relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless technology platform and\n(ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products with identified opportunities in North American Transit\nRail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets.\nOAS Segment\nOur OAS business unit develops and integrates drone-based solutions focusing on high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial\nenterprises. Ondas is marketing comprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its commercially available\nplatforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous and multipurpose aerial data capturing and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™,\na fully autonomous interceptor drone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.\nOur unique, fully autonomous platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and protect critical infrastructure and operations. Our\nbusiness focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense, Homeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other governmental entities together\nwith commercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil & Gas, Seaports, Mining, and Heavy Construction. For these industries, OAS provides specialized real-\ntime aerial data capturing and aerial protection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field area operations, and\nhigh-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services for successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT\nimplementation, safety planning, certification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.\nOur portfolio companies, American Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic combination covering all the aspects required for successful\nAerospace business together with data technologies and services for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing all the challenges arising\nalong these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing support.\nOAS and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record of industry-leading regulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type\nCertification (“TC”) from the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) for the Optimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data\ncapture UAV to achieve this distinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for broad flight operations over\npeople and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design with the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation\nwithin the US National Airspace System (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations for automated UAS. Achieving\nFAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and\nworldwide, we believe that OAS is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to strategically transform critical operations with our\ncutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.\nWar in Israel\nOn October 7, 2023, the State of Israel, where Airobotics’ main offices and facilities are located, suffered a surprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza Strip, which\nled to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring a state of war in Israel. This military operation and related activities are on-going as of the date of this filing.\n44\nThe Company has considered various ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters, including:\n● That approximately 17% of the Company’s workforce in Israel was called to active duty, which temporarily reduced our workforce;\n● That some of the Company’s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other companies in which the Company relies, are currently only partially active, as\ninstructed by the relevant authorities or due to personnel shortages related to the war effort, which resulted in a temporary delay of inventory production; and\n● A slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel.\nThe Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to\nsupport future operations, including the Company’s ability to import materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™ and to ship them outside of Israel. As of the\ndate of this Report, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially adverse effects on its business or operations, but it continues to monitor the situation,\nas any future escalation or change could result in a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company’s Israeli office to support the Company’s activities. The Company does\nnot have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.\nResults of Operations\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\nRevenue, net $ 1,480,792 $ 2,665,190 $ (1,184,398)\nCost of goods sold 1,433,232 2,110,312 (677,080)\nGross profit 47,560 554,878 (507,318)\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative 4,114,986 2,563,319 1,551,667\nSales and marketing 1,410,944 1,224,144 186,800\nResearch and development 3,182,345 2,701,436 480,909\nTotal operating expenses 8,708,275 6,488,899 2,219,376\nOperating loss (8,660,715) (5,934,021) (2,726,694)\nTotal other income (expense), net (865,553) (1,358,440) 492,887\nNet loss $ (9,526,268) $ (7,292,461) $ (2,233,807)\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\nRevenue, net:\nOndas Networks $ 445,288 $ 2,430,954 $ (1,985,666)\nOAS 1,035,504 234,236 801,268\nTotal $ 1,480,792 $ 2,665,190 $ (1,184,398)\nOur revenues decreased by $1,184,398 to $1,480,792 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,665,190 for the three months ended September\n30, 2023. Revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, included $150,668 for products, $887,747 for maintenance, service, support, and subscriptions, and\n$442,377 for development agreements, mainly with Siemens.

The decrease in our revenues were primarily the result of\napproximately $4,224,000 in decreased product sales at Airobotics, who had multi-drone orders during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, but no comparable sales in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a decrease of approximately $4,481,000 in product sales, mainly to Siemens, at Ondas Networks, as further orders have been\ndelayed by the railroads, as they work on implementing the 900 MHz band network. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $204,000 in\nmaintenance, service, support, and subscriptions at OAS as a result of new orders at Airobotics, and an increase of approximately $815,000 in development revenue to Siemens,\nrelated to a new development agreement at Ondas Networks.\nCost of goods sold\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Decrease\nCost of goods sold:\nOndas Networks $ 1,515,774 $ 3,026,466 $ (1,510,692)\nOAS 2,086,195 3,050,129 (963,934)\nTotal $ 3,601,969 $ 6,076,595 $ (2,474,626)\nOur cost of goods sold decreased by $2,474,626 to $3,601,969 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6,076,595 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of decreased revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by fixed manufacturing costs at OAS, resulting in negative gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as\nfurther discussed below.\nGross profit\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Decrease\nGross profit:\nOndas Networks $ (99,356) $ 2,053,186 $ (2,152,542)\nOAS (438,961) 2,600,364 (3,039,325)\nTotal $ (538,317) $ 4,653,550 $ (5,191,867)\nOur gross profit decreased by $5,191,867 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (18%) and 43%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin of 61% is due to the change in the mix of revenues during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included development projects with lower gross margins as compared to product revenue with higher gross margins during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as certain fixed costs related to OAS service delivery.\nOperating Expenses\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Decrease\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative $ 12,177,062 $ 13,347,278 $ (1,170,216)\nSales and marketing 4,040,798 4,205,217 (164,419)\nResearch and development 9,335,323 14,184,420 (4,849,097)\nTotal $ 25,553,183 $ 31,736,915 $ (6,183,732)\n49\nOur principal operating costs include the following items as a percentage of total expense.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nHuman resource costs, including benefits 41% 37%\nTravel and entertainment 2% 2%\nOther general and administration costs:\nProfessional fees and consulting expenses 9% 11%\nOther expense 12% 8%\nDepreciation and amortization 14% 12%\nOther research and deployment costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment 19% 27%\nOther sales and marketing costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment 3% 3%\nOperating expenses decreased by $6,183,732, or 19%, as a result of the following items:\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2024\nHuman resource costs, including benefits $ (1,214,177)\nTravel and entertainment 67,474\nOther general and administration costs:\nProfessional fees and consulting costs (1,370,488)\nOther expense 474,118\nDepreciation and amortization (155,585)\nOther research and development costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment (3,623,652)\nOther sales and marketing costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment (361,422)\n$ (6,183,732)\nThe decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of approximately $1,214,000 in human resource costs, of which approximately $1,474,000\nrelates to the decreased head count at OAS and synergies achieved by integrating American Robotics and Airobotics, and approximately $409,000 relates to decreased\nheadcount at the Company, partially offset by an increase of approximately $337,000 at Ondas Networks due to increased average headcount from hires in the latter part of\n2023, and an increase of approximately $332,000 in stock-based compensation primarily due to new warrants issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; (ii) a\ndecrease of approximately $1,370,000 in professional fees and consulting costs, of which approximately $1,787,000 relates to legal and accounting fee costs, primarily for costs\nincurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for a public offering in 2023 that was not consummated, the acquisition of Airobotics, and legal fees surrounding\nthe acquisition of Ardenna, which were partially recovered in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase of approximately $417,000 related to increased use of\nthird-party contractors and consultants; (iii) a decrease of approximately $3,624,000 in other research and development costs, excluding human resources and travel and\nentertainment, of which approximately $592,000 relates to settlement of all amounts due to a vendor under previous development and manufacturing agreements during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 at American Robotics, approximately $1,368,000 relates to one-time costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nassociated with terminating a development contract at American Robotics, approximately $549,000 relates to synergies achieved by integrating American Robotics and\nAirobotics, and approximately $1,115,000 relates to additional development expenses allocated to cost of goods sold at Ondas Networks; (iv) a decrease of approximately\n$361,000 in other sales and marketing costs, excluding human resources and travel and entertainment related to a decrease in use of third-party contractors and consultants; (v)\npartially offset by a net increase of approximately $474,000 in other operating expense primarily related to increased rent expense and other facility costs.\n50\nOperating Loss\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 Decrease\nOperating loss $ (26,091,500) $ (27,083,365) $ 991,865\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased by $991,865, or 4%, to $26,091,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with\n$27,083,365 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in cash flows used in operating activities of $2,748,095 was primarily due to the\ndecrease in net loss of approximately $3,034,000, of which approximately $1,348,000 related to non-cash and credits, including depreciation, amortization of debt discount and\nissuance costs, amortization of intangibles assets and right of use asset, stock-based compensation, and change in fair value of government grant liability, combined with\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a cash inflow of approximately $1,062,000.\nThe decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities of $2,304,302, relates to an increase of approximately $1,536,000 in payments made for purchase of\nequipment, net of proceeds from disposals, software intangibles and patent costs, combined with decrease of approximately $1,049,000 for cash acquired with the Airobotics\nacquisition in the nine months end September 30, 2023, partially offset by the decrease of approximately $281,000 for cash paid for asset acquisitions in the nine months end\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities of $3,829,302 primarily relates to a decrease in net proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock in\nOndas Networks of approximately $10,317,000; a decrease of approximately $3,472,000 in net proceeds from convertible notes, net of issuance costs, net of cash repayments.\nThis decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities is offset by an increase in proceeds received from the sale of common stock in the Company and options exercised\nof approximately of $7,325,000; an increase of approximately $2,518,000 in proceeds from notes payable, net of issuance costs, net of cash repayments; and an increase of\napproximately $117,000 in cash proceeds received from government grants, net of payments. For a summary of our outstanding Notes Payable, see Note 8 in the accompanying\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of capital stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had an\naccumulated deficit of approximately $226,032,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $2,217,000 net of debt discount\nand issuance costs of $0 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $30,751,000, net of debt discount and issuance cost of approximately $1,537,000 and a\nworking capital deficit of approximately $22,341,000.\nIn 2023, we raised approximately $14,692,000 of net proceeds from the sale of redeemable preferences shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to\nthird parties, and approximately $9,310,000 from a second convertible debt agreement. In the first nine months of 2024, we raised net proceeds of approximately $4,375,000\nfrom the sale of additional redeemable preferred shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, approximately $7,327,000 in net proceeds from\nissuing Common Stock of Ondas Holdings and warrants in OAS, approximately $2,860,000 in net proceeds from issuance of a secured note and convertible note in Ondas\nNetworks, and approximately $300,000 in government grant loans issued to Airobotics. On November 9, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Klear Inc., which provides\nfor financing of accounts receivable, and we have financed approximately $500,000 so far at Ondas Networks.\nWe expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the cash on hand as of September 30,\n2024, proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed above, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders,\npotential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes\npayable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial doubt that the funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been\nalleviated. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from November 12, 2024, the date the unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing and marketing our technologies, the time and costs\ninvolved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing\nactivities and competing technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our target markets. Our ability to generate\nrevenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure purchase orders for our products from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well\nas new customers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These activities, including our planned research and\ndevelopment efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There can be no assurances that we will generate revenue and cash flow as expected in our current\nbusiness plan. We may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. We do not\nknow whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on\ncommercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly\ndelayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n52\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements\nrequires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We base our estimates and\njudgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time and under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates and\njudgments on an ongoing basis. Information concerning our critical accounting policies with respect to these items is available in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since the filing\nof the 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies as summarized in Note 2 of our 2023 Form 10-K. We do not expect that the adoption of any\nrecent accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Report, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us, contain statements that constitute “forward-\nlooking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-\nlooking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. These forward-looking statements are based on our current, reasonable expectations and\nassumptions, which expectations and assumptions are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the\nforward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed\nwith the SEC on April 1, 2024. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no\nobligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide information under this item.\n53\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the\nExchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment\nin evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n54\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFor information related to our legal proceedings, refer to Note 11 —Commitments and Contingencies of Item 1, “Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q.\nItem 1A.

Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses differently, and therefore our measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures usedby other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses should only be used as supplemental measures\nof our operating performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base (depreciation and amortization)\nand other adjustments as set out in the tables included in the Appendix of this presentation, which management has determined are not reflective of\ncoreoperating activities and thereby assistinvestors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses.\nWe believe that cash operating expenses is useful to manage expenses as it excludes non-cash items (depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-\nbased compensation expense) that may obscure our underlying business performance.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA and cash operating expenses in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the Company's\nongoing performance.\n20\nNasdaq: ONDS\nTHANK YOU\nNASDAQ: ONDS| November 12, 2024 Copyright 2024.

Business.\nThis business description should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and\naccompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023 (the “Form 10-K”), which are incorporated herein by this reference.\nThe use of the words “we,” “our,” the “Company” and “Ondas Holdings” in this Form 10-K refer to Ondas\nHoldings Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nCorporate Overview\nOndas Holdings Inc. is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through\nits subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc. (“Ondas Networks”), Ondas Autonomous Holdings Inc. (“OAH”), Airobotics,\nLtd (“Airobotics”), and American Robotics, Inc. (“American Robotics” or “AR”). Airobotics is an Israeli-based\ndeveloper of autonomous drone systems. American Robotics is a leading developer of highly automated commercial\ndrone systems. Airobotics and American Robotics operate together under OAH as a separate business unit called\nOndas Autonomous Systems. Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems together provide users in rail,\nenergy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets with improved connectivity, data\ncollection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks\nand Ondas Autonomous Systems as separate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment.\nSee Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information\nregarding our segments.\nOndas Networks\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet\napplications and services. We refer to these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our\nwireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at\nthe very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to\nprocess large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required in all of the major\ncritical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security\nand government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and\nensure a high degree of safety and security.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”)\nplatform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in\norder to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have targeted the North American\nfreight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy\ncommunications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications.\nThese legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent\ntrain control and management systems. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols,\nand forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred\nby our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it\nrelates to wireless networking for industrial markets. The freight rail operators through the Association of American\nRailroads (“AAR”) and its advisory subsidiary MxV Rail have adopted the IEEE 802.16 standard for future private\nwireless networks.\nOur software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and\noperated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability\nand data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure\nmarkets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols\nand network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput,\nFullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and\nequipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications\nand related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient\nutilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing”\n1\ncapability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable\nedge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable,\nreal-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nOur Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit develops and integrates drone-based solutions focusing\non high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises. Ondas is marketing\ncomprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its\ncommercially available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous\nand multipurpose aerial data capturing and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor\ndrone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.\nOur unique, fully autonomous platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and\nprotect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense,\nHomeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other governmental entities together with\ncommercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil & Gas, Seaports, Mining, and Heavy Construction.\nFor these industries, Ondas Autonomous Systems provides specialized real-time aerial data capturing and aerial\nprotection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field\narea operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services\nfor successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning,\ncertification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.\nOur portfolio companies, American Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic\ncombination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace business together with data technologies and\nservices for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing all the challenges arising\nalong these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing\nsupport.\nOndas Autonomous Systems and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record of industry-leading\nregulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification (TC) from the FAA for the\nOptimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this\ndistinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for\nbroad flight operations over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design\nwith the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace\nSystem (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations\nfor automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight\n(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that\nOndas Autonomous Systems is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to\nstrategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.\nPartnership with Siemens and Market Advancements\nOndas Networks and Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”) have a strategic partnership to both market our\nFullMAX-based networking technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for\nthe North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our\nFullMAX MC-IoT platform.\nWe believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale\nacceptance across the global rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. We have a\njointly-developed product with Siemens — the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems, and Siemens is marketing\nand selling our proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS\nradio systems support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability\nto support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications,\nincluding Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next\ngeneration signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve\nsafety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks’ standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the Siemens\nAirlink brand.\n2\nOndas and Siemens developed a new locomotive radio to support European Railroads. We secured an initial\nvolume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products along\nwith Ondas’ catalog products. We received government authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada and Siemens and\nlaunched our joint effort for the European market at Innotrans in Berlin. Siemens and Ondas demonstrated our over\nthe air compatibility to systems used by passenger rails in the Northeast Corridor of the US. In addition, we have\ndeveloped a new radio for the Head of Train (HOT) Market in North America and a similar product for the Indian rail\nmarket. Siemens has received initial orders for the HOT product from a customer in India.\nIn March 2023 the AAR formally announced that IEEE 802.16 standard would be the wireless platform for the\ngreenfield 900 MHz network. In April 2023, the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association\n(AREMA) voted to require the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz greenfield band; The AAR also confirmed they have\nagreed with the Federal Communications Committee to retire the legacy 900 MHz band by September 2025 and that\nthe wireless network in the new 900 MHz band would be substantially built by April 2026. In May and June 2023, we\nresponded to RFPs to passenger rail customers in the Northeast Corridor. In February 2024, Ondas received an order\nfrom Siemens to develop and supply the next generation ACSES PTC data radio in the 220 MHz frequency band to be\ndesigned specifically for the Northeast Corridor which includes integration of Ondas’ IEEE 802.16 capability.\nOur relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the\nwider marketing of our wireless technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has\nexpanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products with identified opportunities in North American Transit\nRail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology has broad potential in these large,\nnewly targeted markets.\nOur Strategy\nOur goal is to be a global leader in providing turnkey data solutions for industrial, public safety and government\nmarkets by offering i) secure wireless connectivity solutions enabling high-bandwidth, mission-critical Industrial\nInternet applications and services through Ondas Networks and ii) aerial security and data collection and analysis via\nautomated drone platforms through Ondas Autonomous Systems.\nThe key elements of our growth strategy include the following:\n• Deliver multiple North American Class I Railroad network opportunities through our FullMAX\nplatform. Our marketing and business development efforts combined with our exclusive strategic\npartnership with Siemens has generated the potential for significant sales in our targeted end markets. We\nexpect large-scale commercial adoption of our network technology by the North American Class 1 Railroad\noperators in the newly awarded 900 MHz frequency band. Ondas and Siemens together are working with\nour railroad customers on commercial deployment strategies which we expect will significantly increase\npurchase orders for equipment and services in the North American Class I Rail markets with expansion\nplans into passenger and transit markets. In addition, together with Siemens and the Rail industry, we are\npositioning our FullMAX platform as an upgrade for both the 450 MHz HOT network and the legacy\n160 MHz voice-centric networks owned and operated by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators.\n• Expand fleet deployments of our Optimus System™ in the US by marketing solutions to the government\nand commercial markets, focusing on critical infrastructure and public safety applications first, to\novercome the drone industry’s regulatory and operational barriers and extend our first-mover\nadvantage. We have developed a strong customer pipeline with planned commercial deployments of our\nOptimus System™ for government and commercial markets for public safety, smart city, and inspection\nand monitoring of critical assets, industrial facilities, and construction projects. We plan to leverage our\nunique industry positioning, owning the first drone system approved by the FAA for automated remote\noperation BVLOS without a human operator or visual observer on-site, and other qualitative advantages of\nour organization and talent. We will focus on supporting fleet deployments with existing customers while\nexpanding our pipeline of new customer relationships that can be converted to fleet deployments.\n• Expand fleet deployments of our Optimus System™ worldwide by leveraging new distribution\npartners — new international markets with partners we have announced worldwide. In addition, we\nplan to secure additional customers and distribution partners for our Optimus System™ and Iron Drone\nRaider™, while supporting and expanding our fleet deployments in the UAE with existing customers,\nexpanding our new customer pipeline, and pursuing new joint ventures.\n3\n• Expand our offering to the defense sector in the US and worldwide marketing based on our Iron Drone\nRaider™ platform and Optimus System™. We plan to secure a Green UAS List designation from a\nprogram administered by the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems (“AUVSI”) in order to certify the\nOptimus System™ as compliant with the highest levels of cybersecurity and supply chain requirements\nas outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). We believe inclusion on the Green List\nwill further demonstrate the maturity and quality of our system and help accelerate acceptance from\nU.S. governmental entities for use in defense, homeland security, public safety, and municipal markets\nrequiring the highest levels of security and reliability. Upon successful completion of the program, we\nbelieve our Optimus drone will be the only Green UAS certified drone that has also received an FAA Type\nCertificate. We believe the Green List provides an opportunity to transition from the Green UAS cleared\nlist to the Blue UAS cleared list and be eligible for purchase by the U.S. Department of Defense. We plan\nto finalize the Green List certification by the end of April 2024.\n• Expand our industrial wireless and autonomous drone solutions via additional partnerships, joint\nventures, or acquisitions. In addition to internal investment and development, we will continue to\nactively pursue external opportunities to enhance our product offerings and solutions for our critical\ninfrastructure customers via joint ventures, partnerships, and acquisitions. We intend to focus on companies\nwith complementary technologies or product offerings or synergistic distribution strategies.\nOur Business Model\nOndas Networks\nWe sell our FullMAX MC-IoT wireless products and services globally through a direct sales force and\nvalue-added sales partners to industrial and critical infrastructure providers including major rail operators, with growth\nopportunities in other markets such as commercial and industrial drone operators, electric and gas utilities, water and\nwastewater utilities, oil and gas producers and pipeline operators, and for other critical infrastructure applications in\nareas such as public safety, homeland security and defense, and transportation. We continue to develop our value-added\nreseller relationships which today include a strategic partnership with Siemens for the development of new types of\nwireless connectivity for the North American Rail market as well as selected global markets in both Europe and Asia.\nWe believe our Siemens’ partnership is indicative of the potential for additional Tier 1 partnerships in our other vertical\nmarkets including securing reseller relationships with major suppliers to the worldwide government and homeland\nsecurity markets.\nIn executing our go-to-market strategy, we intend to monetize our software-based intellectual property and grow\nrevenue and cash flow with embedded FullMAX software sales, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) arrangements, IP\nroyalties based on Ondas Networks software and through additional services provided to customers and ecosystem\npartners. Customers deploy our connectivity and Fog-computing platform in private networks that are designed for\nlifetimes of 10 – 15 years or even longer. Our FullMAX platform is software-defined and offers customers flexibility\nto expand capacity and evolve network utilization. Similarly, our ecosystem partners often integrate our FullMAX\nsoftware and wireless capability into their own long-lived equipment and systems which their customers purchase and\ndeploy. As such, we believe our software solutions provide ongoing revenue opportunities related to both connectivity\nvalue and edge computing capability. Customers and ecosystem partners will require ongoing FullMAX system and\nsecurity enhancements and for us to design additional features which create opportunities for additional, recurring\nrevenue and profit streams. Our monetization strategies include:\nSystems sales: Our FullMAX deployments are typically large, mission-critical wide-area networks deployed\nand privately operated by our industrial and government customers. These end-to-end system deployments involve\nsales consisting of both base stations and edge radio end points with embedded FullMAX software and network\nmanagement software and tools.\nSoftware and hardware maintenance agreements: Our customers contract with us for extended software and\nhardware maintenance which provide them with critical ongoing support for their installed network. These contracts\nprovide revenue to us in the year following an initial installation. Software maintenance licenses entitle the customer\nto ongoing software and security upgrades as well as enabling the provision of additional system features. Similarly,\nhardware maintenance programs provide customers with extended equipment warranty terms for an installed network.\n4\nThese arrangements allow our customers to continue to maintain a modern, flexible and upgradeable network\nover a long period of time. These agreements may extend for multiple years given the long average life of the installed\nand growing network.\nLicensing/Royalties: In certain system deployments, our ecosystem partners may choose to embed FullMAX\nsoftware into their own hardware and software platforms providing us with an ongoing per device multi-year revenue\nstream. Licensing is an effective way for an ecosystem partner to jumpstart customer activity. Alternatively, a partner\nmay choose to develop software based on our intellectual property generating royalty revenue.\nOther Services: We provide ancillary services directly related to the sale of our wireless communications\nproducts which include wireless network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software configuration,\nproduct training, installation, and onsite support. Furthermore, we also provide engineering and product development\nservices to ecosystem partners who are interested in integrating their intelligent equipment with our FullMAX SDR\nplatform and need our expertise to do so.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nOndas Autonomous Systems markets aerial solutions based on its Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™\nplatforms via direct sales to enterprises and government customers. Additionally, Ondas Autonomous Systems utilizes\nchannel marketing strategies, building a network of partners and agents to distribute our solutions. We focus on\nidentifying and qualifying large, sophisticated customers with active drone programs who have the ability and intent\nto expand those programs and eventually deploy fleets of automated drones across their portfolio of assets. Our unique\nvalue proposition is based on our core strategic capability to provide holistic solutions, being a trusted one-stop-shop\nfor major entities, and de-risking innovative complex drone implementation processes.\nAfter initial customer qualification, contracting and the receipt of a purchase order, we ship and install our\nplatforms and solutions on the customer premises. Via American Robotics and Airobotics staff, we are planning our\ncustomers deployments providing complete support for all stages of implementation. Our field service personnel\nremain on location for a short period of time to ensure the programmed automated drone operations are meeting\ncustomer and regulatory requirements and implemented successfully on-prem, on-time and on-budget.\nWe offer our solutions in several business models designated to allow the required flexibility and benefits for our\ncustomers and creating recurring revenues and organic growth within our accounts:\n• Drone Infrastructure and Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) — This model is the typical agreement we have\nwith our customers. Our Optimus System™ based solutions can be provided under a DaaS agreement\nwhere we bundle hardware, software, operations, and maintenance into one annual subscription fee. We\ninstall the Optimus Systems as a fixed aerial infrastructure on premises or areas serving one or multiple\ncustomers on a flexible consumption business model allowing end users to procure aerial and data services\nover the drone network in the area. This model is applicable in two major scenarios:\n• Owner/Operator Model — For example, an agreement with a construction site owner/operator as\nthe central user of the services with additional aerial data services to subcontractors and tenants of\nthe construction site. The site owner/operator will use the drone infrastructure for progress remote\nmonitoring and planed-vs-built applications, and in addition will allow more services to the site’s\ntenants and sub-contractors such as monitoring and inspection and data collection use cases. In\nmany instances, multiple customers will subscribe for each unique service.\n• Joint-Venture Model — For example, when entering an urban industrial area and deploying the\ndrone infrastructure in partnership with an established local governmental or commercial entity\nand providing data service to the entity and to third party customers in the region creating recurring\nrevenue by increasing the amount and type of service provided over to drone network.\n• Direct Sales & Service — Our Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™ platforms can be purchased\nand be owned and operated by our end users or resellers via partnerships or joint ventures with third\nparty drone services providers. These types of agreements typically include arrangements for ongoing\nservices including training and maintenance. System purchases can be preferred by certain public safety\nand homeland security customers directly or via distribution through value-added resellers and partners.\n5\nOur Products and Services\nOndas Networks\nOndas Networks has developed a next-generation radio platform specifically to meet the evolving data needs of\nlarge industrial and government customers and markets. These markets are differentiated from consumer markets in\nthat the customers assets are dispersed over very wide and remote geographies with specific challenges to installation,\nmaintenance, and upgrades. These challenges led us to design a new type of software-based radio platform capable of\nsupporting a long useful life to the network hardware. Instead of using low cost, off the shelf, dedicated communications\nchipsets (“ASICs”), we selected powerful programmable embedded general-purpose processors, DSPs, and FPGAs,\nall of which are software upgradable. Our software defined radio (“SDR”) architecture allows us to customize almost\nany aspect of the air interface protocol, the key components of which are patented and have been incorporated into new\nIEEE wireless standards. The ability to constantly improve customer networks and hosted software applications with\nflexible, over-the-air software upgrade helps create customer loyalty and creates high switching costs.\nOur FullMAX SDR platform is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for\ntruly mission-critical applications. An end-to-end FullMAX network consists of connected wireless base stations, fixed\nand mobile edge radios and supporting technology all enabled by critical software developed and owned by Ondas\nNetworks. The Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end FullMAX SDR platform, primarily through\ndocker container technology, is valued by our customers and ecosystem partners as they seek to leverage the value\nof MC-IoT applications for improved safety, efficiency, and profitability. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is\ndesigned to optimize the performance of unused or underutilized VHF/UHF low frequencies licensed radio spectrum\nand narrower channels. We do this through various patented software algorithms including via “spectrum harvesting”\ntechniques which aggregate narrowband channels to create increased broadband network capacity. Our channel\naggregation algorithms include the ability to aggregate hard to utilize, non-contiguous narrowband channels and are a\nhallmark feature of a FullMAX broadband system.\nThe critical software algorithms powering our end-to-end FullMAX wireless SDR platform and related\nFog-computing architecture have been developed by and are owned by Ondas Networks. FullMAX is an intelligent\nnetworking system which integrates core network management systems with edge computing resources including\ncomputing hardware and MC-IoT software applications. In the MC-IoT Fog enabled by FullMAX, base stations are\nenabled with a highly configurable Quality of Service algorithms which coordinate the data traffic within the Fog for\nboth the edge radio and the resident MC-IoT applications. The intelligent base stations control and manage all network\nresources including our edge remotes; dynamically allocating bandwidth, prioritizing data packets and managing edge\napplications. The intelligent software-managed base stations determine whether to process data at the edge, distribute\ndata traffic across the Fog to other edge remote radios or to transport information to the corporate Cloud. Our Edge\nremotes have embedded compute capability and are able to host MC-IoT applications including those from third party\nvendors via virtualized software systems managed in docker/container architectures and can also manage data from\nintelligent equipment or sensor networks that interface with the edge remotes in the field. Our software-managed edge\nremotes offer security via authentication, multi-layer encryption and virtual software firewalls which are requirements\nfor mission-critical data networks.\nWe are dedicated to promoting standards-based wireless connectivity solutions for our customers. Our FullMAX\nplatform is compliant with the mission critical wireless Industrial Internet IEEE 802.16. Since 2017, the specifications\nin the IEEE 802.16 standard are primarily based on our FullMAX technology, and many of our customers and\nindustrial partners actively support our technology during the IEEE standards-making process. In January 2020, a\nnew working group was launched by the IEEE to establish IEEE 802.16t, a further evolution of this wireless standard.\nThe IEEE 802.16t working group includes industry-leading trade organizations such as the Association of American\nRailroads (“AAR”), MxV Rail (“MxV Rail”), the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and the Electric Power Research\nInstitute (EPRI), as well as representation from world-leading transportation and oil and gas companies. IEEE 802.16t\nhas now received approval to be incorporated into the standard, which is expected to be published in 2024. This\nnew version of the standard has incorporated many new critical functionalities including support for software\ncontrol/coordinate base stations and direct peer to peer (DPP) connections. We expect our technology to remain a\nprominent feature of this evolving standard.\n6\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nWe provide our customers with turnkey data and security aerial solutions designed to meet their unique\nrequirements in complex environments.

We offer support and engineering services to\nour customers in order to successfully integrate our aerial platforms with the highest levels of both automation and\ndata security, quickly and efficiently.\nThe Market for Our Products and Services\nOndas Networks\nWe have targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform.\nThese rail operators currently operate legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless\ntechnologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are\nunable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. In addition to data capacity\nchallenges, rail operators need to reliably cover the vast and often remotely located rail track and related infrastructure\nwhich extends nationwide. The rail operators require a next-generation, robust broadband system with significantly\nincreased data throughput capacity and flexibility to adopt new applications. We believe a transition to integrated\nFog-computing wireless communications systems will enable the rail operators to drive more intelligence to the edge\nof their operating environments enabling real time automation and better operator control of many critical operating\nsystems related to train control, crossing safety, train and track integrity and drone operations. This upgrade cycle is\nbeing driven by a recent key event in which the Class 1 rail systems in the U.S are required, by 2025, to vacate a series\nof legacy narrowband channels given to them by the FCC. The completion of this multiyear negotiation between the\nFCC and other licensed users is projected to generate a major network upgrade cycle for the rail industry which will\nsupport enhanced safety and improved efficiency and profitability of train operations.\n8\nThe North American Rail Network is vast in scale, consisting of 140,000 miles of track, 25,000 locomotives, and\n1.6 million railcars. Within this large footprint, we believe there are 200,000 highway crossings, with at least 65,000 of\nthe crossings equipped with electronic systems today, a number which is expected to increase in the coming years. The\nClass I railroads currently operate four separate private wireless networks in support of train operations. Those networks\nare deployed using spectrum in the 160 MHz, 220 MHz, 450 MHz and 900 MHz bands. We believe a significant portion\nof the communications infrastructure has been in operation for more than 20 years and now requires a technological\nupgrade to support new applications and increased capacity requirements. Our FullMAX MC-IoT platform offers an\nexcellent migration path for these applications. The Class I Railroads value the ability of our frequency agnostic SDR\narchitecture to enable a substantial data capacity increase utilizing the railroad’s existing wireless infrastructure and\ndedicated FCC licensed radio frequencies, as well as the flexibility to adapt to and take advantage of future changes in\nspectrum availability, as well as future business and operational requirements. Based upon management estimates, we\nbelieve the addressable market for the four private North American Railroad networks is approximately $1.3 billion.\nWe believe the 900 MHz network will be the first network upgrade to adopt our FullMAX technology and we estimate\nthat the market size for the 900 MHz network is approximately $450 million.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nThe total addressable market (“TAM”) of Ondas Autonomous Systems is measured at over $100 billion in size\naccording to management estimates and independent third-party research. The TAM comprises the potential value\nof Ondas’ Optimus System in the global civil and military UAV market and in the drone services market and the\naddressable market of the Iron-Drone Raider system in the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) markets.\nOndas competes in the large drone markets which was valued by a study by Spherical Insights at $28.5 billion\nin 2021 and forecasted to grow further at a compound annual growth rate of 27% reaching $260 billion by 2030. In\naddition, Ondas provides drone services including drone data and data analytics based on multiple various sensors, in\naddition to maintenance, repair and operational service. According to Fortune Business Insights, drone market services\nis valued at $13.9 billion in 2022 and projected to grow to $189.4 billion by 2030. In the US, the FAA anticipates that\nthe growth rate in the commercial drone sector will remain high over the next few years. This is primarily driven by the\nregulatory clarity that Part 107 rules continues to provide to industry. This is further supported by the Operations Over\nPeople final rule, published on December 28, 2020, which is the latest incremental step towards further integration\nof small drones into the national airspace. Ondas has secured a key position within this market, holding the first FAA\nAirworthiness Type Certificate, allowing it to apply to fly its drones in complex populated environments.\nIn addition to the Optimus System and its related drone services, Ondas also competes in the C-UAS market\nproviding the Iron-Drone Raider system for counter drone kinetic interception. The growing C-UAS technology market\nhas been valued in a recent study published by Grand View Research in 2023, at $1.4 billion in 2022, and $1.9 billion\nin 2023, and forecasted growth at a compound annual growth rate of 28.1% from 2023 to 2030 with a revenue forecast\nfor 2030 of $10.6 billion. We believe these studies underestimate the potential market size, because they don’t fully\nconsider the potential effect of security vulnerabilities on the value of the activities the C-UAS equipment protects and\nenables, in sensitive locations such as major sporting events, and the protection of industrial assets such as in the energy\nand utility sectors. Notably, although the North American C-UAS marketplace is the largest by revenue, twelve other\nregions of the world are also active in C-UAS. High-profile events in other countries involving UAS such as the war\nin Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, or the December 2018 Gatwick Airport incident when reported UA sightings\nessentially closed that major airport — have drawn attention to the need for C-UAS technology internationally.\nCustomer Activity\nOndas Networks\nThe majority of Ondas Networks customer activity has been with the Class 1 freight railroad operators\nand Siemens in North America. There are seven Class I railroads in North America, all of which run multiple,\nfrequency-specific networks for different applications. Our FullMAX platform has the flexibility to operate in all these\nfrequency bands and will allow these customers the opportunity to better utilize their radio spectrum and add more\nhigh-value, data-intensive applications to their operations. Ondas Networks has completed multiple, testing and pilot\nprograms with railroads including Norfolk Southern Corporation, BNSF Railway Company and CSX Corporation,\nthree North American Class I freight railroad operators. This activity has spanned from the system validation work\n9\nperformed on behalf of the Association of American Railroads’ (AAR) Wireless Communications Committee (WCC)\nas well as the current programs managed by Ondas and Siemens to formally integrate Ondas wireless technology in\noperational 900 MHz networks. Our initial focus with these rail customers has been for train control applications and\nrelated safety systems in the 900 MHz frequency band where the FCC has recently awarded our railroad customers\nnew radio spectrum.\nWe delivered a Rail Lab (the “dot16 Rail Lab”) to MxV Rail, a subsidiary of the AAR. The dot16 Rail Lab is\nhosting multiple Class 1 freight rail operators where they will perform on going network design and configuration\nrelated to optimizing the performance of our IEEE 802.16 complaint systems in connection with wide-scale field\ndeployment. In March 2023, the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) formally announced that IEEE 802.16\nstandard would be the wireless platform for the greenfield 900 MHz network. In April 2023, the American Railway\nEngineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) voted to require the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz\ngreenfield band; The AAR also confirmed they have agreed with the Federal Communications Committee to retire\nthe legacy 900 MHz band by September 2025 and that the wireless network in the new 900 MHz band would be\nsubstantially built by April 2026.\nWe are currently engaged in field installation activities with multiple railroads to demonstrate integration of our\nFullMAX wireless systems with existing legacy train systems at the wayside through the back-office in the 900 MHz\nnetwork. We believe that successful completion of this demonstrated integration activity will lead to commercial\nvolume orders which will begin the commercial rollout of the 900 MHz with multiple Class 1 freight railroads, as well\nas certain short line, passenger and transit railroads in 2024 of our software-defined wireless network technology. We\nexpect a 900 MHz network upgrade cycle across all Class I railroad systems over the next few years in order to comply\nwith FCC license requirements and meet business needs related to safety and profitability.\nWe have also engaged the AAR and the WCC on the technical roadmap for the legacy 160 MHz wireless\nnetwork used by the railroads in North America. We believe the 160 MHz network will be the next major wireless\nnetwork the railroads upgrade utilizing IEEE 802.16t technology.,\nAs of December 31, 2023, Ondas Networks was active with six of the Class 1 Rails in North America and with\none of the largest railroads in the world, Indian Railways, for a multi-year delivery program of locomotive radios for\non-board telemetry applications.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nOur Optimus System™ addresses a wide number of applications and use cases across enterprise, industrial, and\ngovernment end markets. The platform has been extensively tested both internally and externally with customers for\nreliability, safety, and performance. We received purchase orders from two customers in the UAE in December 2022,\nwhich represented our initial orders for commercial deployment as Urban Drone Infrastructure fleets. The initial\npurchase order was received for a UAE government entity with plans to primarily use the system for public safety\nand homeland security applications. We also announced a purchase order from Abu Dhabi-based SkyGo Transport of\nGoods L.L.C. (“SkyGo”). Airobotics and SkyGo have also signed a Term Sheet agreeing to enter into a joint venture\n(the “SkyGo JV”) to provide aerial drone services to municipal and government customers focused on Smart City use\ncases.\nCustomer interest in our aerial data services has grown significantly since receiving these initial fleet orders and\nthat is reflected in a growing customer pipeline. The initial two customers have indicated plans to deploy approximately\n50 systems in the UAE by 2025 and we believe demand could grow further. In addition, moving customers from\nproof-of-concept deployments to Urban Drone Infrastructure fleet deployments has validated the performance and\nvalue of our Optimus System™, which has helped both accelerate our marketing activity with existing customers and\ngenerated new customer interest to help expand the pipeline. We expect interest in our Optimus System™ to grow\nsignificantly as awareness builds which will expand our customer pipeline.\nWe expect to expand customer activity in the United States as American Robotics introduces Optimus to its\nexisting customers and expands marketing to new customers. In the United States, we are qualifying our oil and gas\ncustomers for marketing programs, and we plan to expand marketing to other industrial and government markets.\n10\nWe launched our Raider™ counter-drone system in March 2023 and began seeking customer orders at the same\ntime. We have seen significant interest in the Raider™ For potential customers and partners and on March 10, 2023\nwe announced that the Dubai Police has signed an MOU which expressed their intent to purchase a certain number of\nunits of the Raider™. We expect to receive additional orders as we expand marketing channels in 2024.\nOur Optimus System™ addresses a wide range of applications and use cases across enterprise, industrial, and\ngovernment end markets. The platform has been extensively tested both internally and externally with customers for\nreliability, safety, and performance.\nIn the Middle East and Africa region, during 2023, we received purchase orders from two customers in the UAE,\nrepresenting our initial orders for commercial deployment as Urban Drone Infrastructure fleets. The initial purchase\norder was received from a UAE government entity that has been deploying an urban drone infrastructure based on\nOur Optimus System™ since 2020. The infrastructure primarily utilizes the systems for public safety and homeland\nsecurity applications. During 2023, we received a $2.6 million order for more Optimus systems and an additional\nservice agreement with this local government entity for ongoing support and maintenance of the installed systems\nin Dubai. In February, we also announced a $3.6 million purchase order from Abu Dhabi-based SkyGo Transport of\nGoods L.L.C. (“SkyGo”). Airobotics and SkyGo have also signed a Term Sheet agreeing to enter into a joint venture\n(the “SkyGo JV”) to provide aerial drone services to municipal and government customers focused on Smart City use\ncases. We have successfully completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) with SkyGo as the first milestone, and we are looking\nforward to continuing the development of this new business in Abu Dhabi in 2024.\nIn addition to these deals, we have announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate for the\npurpose of providing aerial defensive solutions against potential aerial threats and to cooperate in the implementation\nof the Optimus System™. Through the MOU, Airobotics and Dubai Police will work towards developing joint\nactivities in fields of common interest, aligning the Optimus System with the operational goals of Dubai Police, and\nimplementing AI technologies to enhance the performance of the Optimus and Iron-Drone systems. Dubai Police also\ndeclared its intention to purchase a certain number of our counter-drone solution, Iron Drone Raider™.\nWe have also announced collaboration with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd, the Israeli leading defense\ncompany, utilizing each company’s technology to leverage the Optimus System™ Infrastructure and Rafael’s newly\nunveiled METRO DOME and DRONE DOME to enable advanced autonomous drone operations and services for\nmunicipal and government clients in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nIn addition to our activities in the Middle East, we have announced entering a strategic alliance with Saudi\nExcellence, one of the leading companies in the Gulf region. This alliance aims to bring next-generation security and\ndefense technologies to Saudi government and enterprises across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Our goal is to\nestablish a local drone infrastructure throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to develop and foster an ecosystem\nof technology and service providers across the KSA by employing local staff and working closely with local partners.\nFurthermore, we have announced a strategic partnership with Morocco-Based Maghrebnet, a Moroccan vendor\nspecialized in information technologies, security, networks, telecommunications, electricity, and renewable energies.\nThe partnership is intended to offer advanced drone infrastructure in North Africa and to manufacture Optimus\nDrone-In-a-Box systems in the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Senegal. Additionally, we aim to establish a\nJoint Research and Development (R&D) & Training center in Morocco.\nIn Israel, during February 2023, we announced an additional purchase order from a major Semiconductor Chip\nManufacturer where Our Optimus System™ has been deployed since 2016. Since 2020, Optimus operations have\nextended to support a mega construction project, providing a unified data platform and analytics services to the\ncompany and its contractor companies. The Optimus System and its geo-visual data platform are being utilized by\nhundreds of users, including project owner staff and contractors, to visualize, understand, and share the status of\nconstruction. The system provides a shared data platform and portal that enhances productivity and communication\nbetween teams and organizations while maintaining its original security and remote supervision routine operations.\nAdditionally, in response to the Israeli-Gaza crisis, we announced that we are accelerating our development\nprocess of the Iron Drone Raider™ system to meet specific requirements of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nFurthermore, we announced the awarding of a $0.5 million grant from the Israel Innovation Authority to further\nadvance the features of Iron Drone Raider™ features. We believe these efforts will lead to purchase orders in the first\nquarter 2024.\n11\nIn the United States, we announced that American Robotics commenced a paid pilot program with the\nMassachusetts Department of Transportation (“MassDOT”) Aeronautics Division. During the fourth quarter 2023\nand the first quarter of 2024, American Robotics deployed the Optimus System™ and conducted several successful\ndemonstrations for MassDOT stakeholders, featuring rail inspections, emergency response, and environmental\nmonitoring applications. During these demonstrations, the Optimus system operated remotely and autonomously,\nfollowing American Robotics’ receipt of FAA waivers for beyond-visual-line-of-sight drone operations. We expect to\nsecure systems purchase in 2024 as a result of this activity and to expand program to include fleet deployments of the\nOptimus System.\nWe anticipate expanding customer activity in the United States as American Robotics introduces Optimus to\nits existing customers and broadens its marketing efforts to reach new customers. In the United States, we are also\nqualifying more government customers from additional state and federal departments for marketing programs, and we\nplan to expand marketing efforts to other industrial and government markets. We are also planning to introduce Iron\nDrone Raider to customers in the United States in the security and defense sectors in 2024.\nCustomer interest in our aerial data services has experienced significant growth in the US market and\nworldwide. Operations of our Optimus System™ in the Middle East and the USA have not only accelerated our\nmarketing activities with existing customers but have also generated new customer interest, thereby expanding our\npipeline. Additionally, ongoing conflicts worldwide, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, have heightened the\ndemand for our technologies. As more entities recognize the potential of autonomous drones and the necessity of\nprotecting against them, interest in our Optimus System™ and Iron Drone Raider™ is expected to surge. We believe\nthis increased awareness will further expand our customer pipeline in the United States and worldwide.\nManufacturing, Availability and Dependence upon Suppliers\nOndas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems utilize outsourced manufacturing partners in the building\nof product to fulfill customer orders. Utilizing contract manufacturers allows us to focus on designing, developing\nand selling our products. Furthermore, outsourced manufacturing allows us to leverage the economies of scale and\nexpertise of specialized outsourced manufacturers, reduce manufacturing and supply chain risk and distribution costs.\nOndas Networks designs the printed circuit boards and enclosures for our radios. The physical manufacturing\nof FullMAX circuit boards is outsourced to best-in-class industrial contract manufacturers. The contract manufacturer\nis responsible for sourcing the majority of components, assembling the components onto the printed circuit boards\nand then delivering the final boards to us. Once at our facility, the boards are tested, then placed into enclosures\nand programmed with the appropriate software. The radios are then configured according to the requirement of the\nnetwork and run through system level tests before being packaged and shipped to the customer. Ondas Networks\nmaintains multiple contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to ensure competitive pricing and to\nreduce the risk from a single manufacturer.\nOndas Autonomous Systems designs the Optimus System™ and the Iron Drone™ and specifies all components\nincluding the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each\nneeded to manufacture the end product.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, three\ncustomers accounted approximately $6,703,000, $5,127,000, and $3,395,000 of our revenue or approximately 43%,\n33%, and 22%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately\n$1,893,000 of our revenue, or approximately 89%.\n13\nCompetition\nOndas Networks\nWe compete with alternatives to wireless technology, public cellular data networks and private wireless\nnetworking products from other manufacturers. We believe that each of these competing solutions has core weaknesses\nwhen compared to FullMAX, as described below.\nPublic cellular data networks:\n• Public networks are more vulnerable to cyber security attacks from anywhere in the world including denial\nof service attacks; private networks can operate independent of the public internet.\n• Public networks are more susceptible to prolonged outages during man-made and natural disasters\n(e.g. 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, etc.), exactly when utilities and mission critical entities require the greatest\nreliability.\n• Public networks are typically designed for population coverage rather than the geographic areas required\nby critical infrastructure providers, which often include remote locations.\n• Public networks are by definition oversubscribed, shared networks without the necessary prioritization\nservice to support mission critical applications.\n• Public networks typically use shared infrastructure including tower sites and long-haul fiber connections\nresulting in vulnerabilities at many points.\n• Public networks are designed to support high capacity downloading and streaming applications with\nlimited upload bandwidth available. Industrial networks typically require the reverse traffic flow, often\nuploading data from a large number of remote locations.\nOther private wireless products:\n• Unlicensed Point to Multipoint Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) — This equipment is very inexpensive to purchase\nbut is subject to interference, has many security vulnerabilities, uses a contention-based protocol and\ntransmits only over short range. Deploying Wi-Fi over wide areas is cost prohibitive.\n• Private Licensed Narrowband Wireless Radios — These networks can provide good coverage and range\nbut are typically too slow and lack sufficient bandwidth to support new applications and the increased\nnumber of data connections required.\nAlternate technologies:\n• Satellite Technologies — These technologies provide good coverage, but throughput is limited, and latency\nis too high to support mission-critical applications for our customers. These technologies can be very\ncostly as compared to our products and systems.\n• Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) — LP-WAN solutions such as LoRa and NB-IoT are\narchitected with lower power, the purpose of which is to make these typically sensor-based networks\nlower-cost solutions. The low powered equipment means these systems have lower throughput and higher\nlatency and are not reliable for mission-critical applications that require both monitoring and control\nfunctions.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nWe compete with other drone OEMs providing a variety of solutions for inspection, security, asset tracking and\nother applications. We compete on many dimensions with system performance being differentiated by the level of\nautonomous operation, ease of use, reliability, safety, and government regulations. Further, leading automated data\nsolution providers must provide diverse payload capabilities for data collection, along with robust, advanced analytics\nprograms that are specific for each industry served.\n14\nGovernmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including: (i) authorization\nfrom the FCC and other global communications regulators for operation in various licensed frequency bands;\n(ii) FAA and other global Civil Aviation Authority regulations and approvals unique to the operation of commercial\nor industrial drones; (iii) customers’ licenses from the FCC; (iv) licensing, permitting and inspection requirements\napplicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; (v) regulations relating to worker safety and environmental\nprotection; (vi) permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; (vii) wage and hour\nregulations; (viii) regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting\nrequirements; (ix) building and electrical codes; and (x) special bidding, procurement and other requirements on\ngovernment projects.\nWe believe we have the licenses materially required to conduct our operations, and we are in substantial\ncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The operation of our manufactured products by our customers\n(network providers and service providers) in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in a manner not in compliance with local\nlaw could result in fines, business disruption, or harm to our reputation. The changes to regulatory and technological\nrequirements may also alter our product offerings, impacting our market share and business. Failure to comply with\napplicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or could give rise to\ntermination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.\nIsrael’s defense export policy regulates the sale of a number of our systems and products. Current Israeli policy\nencourages exports to approved customers of defense systems and products such as ours, as long as the export is\nconsistent with Israeli government policy. Subject to certain exemptions, a license is required to initiate marketing\nactivities. We also must receive a specific export license for defense related hardware, software and technology exported\nfrom Israel. Israeli law also regulates export of “dual use” items (items that are typically sold in the commercial market\nbut that also may be used in the defense market).\nEnvironmental Regulation\nOur operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws\nand substantial related regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among\nother matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the operation, handling, transportation\nand disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers; and require us to obtain and maintain\nlicenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant\ncompliance burdens and risks on us. Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance\nwith all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations.\nThere has been no material adverse effect to our Consolidated Financial Statements nor competitive positions as\na result of these environmental regulations.\nEmployees\nAs of March 29, 2024, we have 108 full-time employees, including 35 in the Ondas Networks segment and\n73 in the Ondas Autonomous Systems segment. In addition, we have consulting agreements with 14 consultants for\nmanufacturing, supply chain, documentation, engineering, regulatory, IT, and business development support.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we may hire temporary employees. We also utilize contractors to manufacture\ncomponents, for certain research and development and for system deployment functions. None of our employees are\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We consider our\nrelationship with our employees to be good.\nCorporate Information\nOndas Holdings Inc. was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 22, 2014, under the name Zev Ventures\nIncorporated. On September 28, 2018, we acquired Ondas Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation, changed our name\nto Ondas Holdings Inc., and discontinued the prior business of Zev Ventures Incorporated. On August 5, 2021, Ondas\nHoldings Inc. acquired American Robotics, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On January 23, 2023, Ondas Holdings Inc.\n15\nacquired Airobotics Ltd., an Israeli corporation. See Note 5 — Goodwill and Business Acquisitions of the accompanying\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Airobotics Ltd. acquisition. On February 14,\n2023, the Company formed Ondas Autonomous Systems, a new business unit to manage the combined drone\noperations of American Robotics and Airobotics. On December 6, 2023, the Company formed Ondas Autonomous\nHoldings Inc., a Nevada corporation, as an intermediate holding company which now wholly-owns American\nRobotics and Airobotics.\nAs a result of the above, Ondas Networks, OAH, American Robotics and Airobotics became our subsidiaries.\nOndas Holdings’ corporate headquarters are located in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Ondas Networks has offices\nand facilities in Sunnyvale, California, American Robotics’ offices and facilities are located in Sparks, Maryland and\nMarlborough, Massachusetts, and Airobotics’ offices and facilities are located in Petah Tikva, Israel.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet website is www.ondas.com.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you invest in our common stock, you should\ncarefully consider the following risks, as well as general economic and business risks, and all of the other information\ncontained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could harm our business, operating results and financial\ncondition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment. When determining whether to invest, you should also refer to the other information contained in this\nForm 10-K including our financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or\nsustain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nwe had an accumulated deficit of approximately $198 million and $154 million, respectively. To date, we have financed\nour operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and debt financing.\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we pursue our growth strategy, including expending\nsubstantial resources for research, development and marketing. The extent of our future operating losses and the\ntiming of profitability are highly uncertain, and we expect to continue incurring significant expenses and operating\nlosses over the next several years. Any additional operating losses may have an adverse effect on our stockholders’\nequity and the price of our common stock, and we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to achieve profitability.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability. Additionally, our costs\nmay increase in future periods and we may expend substantial financial and other resources on, among things, sales and\nmarketing, the hiring of additional officers, employees, contractors and other service providers, and general administration,\nwhich may include a significant increase in legal and accounting expenses related to public company compliance, continued\ncompliance and various regulations applicable to our business or arising from the growth and maturity of our company.\nOur failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise\ncapital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain regulatory approvals, diversify our product and\nservice offerings or continue our operations, and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe adoption of the IEEE 802.16t wireless broadband standard, an evolution of the IEEE 802.16s standard\npublished in 2017, by customers in our target critical infrastructure sectors is uncertain.\nOndas Networks is currently developing technology compatible with the proposed wireless broadband standard\nknown as IEEE 802.16t, which is an evolution of the EEE 802.16s wireless broadband standard published in\nOctober 2017. We believe we are currently the only manufacturer of IEEE 802.16s compliant wireless solutions and\nare likely to be the only manufacturer of IEEE 802.16t compliant wireless solutions when that standard is formally\nratified. The benefits of the standard to buyers of our equipment are greater when there exists a large, deep market\nin terms of the number of customers. A large market benefits from the scale provided such that many vendors can\ncompete on service, price and quality of solution driving improved value for customers. If a large end market does\nnot develop and customers do not see the related benefits from the standard, we may not be able to grow our business.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic partnerships with third parties such as Siemens Mobility,\nwho are also customers, as well as on our ability to establish a broad range of additional ecosystem partner and\ncustomer relationships with leading global industrial vendors.\nIn order to grow our business, we depend on partnerships with market leading technology and industrial\ncompanies such as Siemens Mobility, who are also customers of Ondas Networks in order to accelerate the adoption\nof our wireless technology. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our partnership and customer relationships with third\nparties, including Siemens Mobility, or if our partnerships do not provide us the anticipated benefits, our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. In addition,\nadoption of our FullMAX wireless platform, Optimus System™, and Iron Drone Raider™ requires us to establish\nadditional ecosystem relationships with leading global industrial vendors and customers. Even if we are successful\nin executing these partnerships and integrating with additional ecosystem vendors, we cannot assure you that these\npartnerships and relationships will result in increased adoption of our technology or increased revenue.\n17\nIf the commercial UAS markets do not experience significant growth, if we cannot expand our customer base or\nif our products and services do not achieve broad acceptance, then we may not be able to achieve our anticipated\nlevel of growth.\nWe cannot accurately predict the future growth rates or sizes of the markets for our products and services.\nDemand for our products and services may not increase, or may decrease, either generally or in specific markets, for\nparticular types of products and services or during particular time periods. We believe the market for commercial UAS\nis nascent and the expansion of the market for our products and services in particular, depends on a number of factors,\nincluding the following:\n• customer satisfaction with these types of systems as solutions;\n• the cost, performance and reliability of our products and products offered by our competitors;\n• customer perceptions regarding the effectiveness and value of these types of systems;\n• obtaining timely regulatory approvals for new customer deployments; and\n• marketing efforts and publicity regarding these types of systems and services.\nEven if commercial UAS gain wide market acceptance, our products and services may not adequately address\nmarket requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance. If these types of systems generally, or our\nproducts and services specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance, then we may not be able to achieve our\nanticipated level of growth and our revenue and results of operations would decline.\nNegative customer perception regarding the commercial UAS industry or the Company’s automated data solutions\ncould have a material adverse effect on the demand for the Company’s products and the business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company.\nThe Company believes the commercial UAS industry is highly dependent upon customer perception regarding\nthe safety, efficacy, and quality of the commercial UAS system deployed. Customer perception of these products can\nbe significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention, and\nother publicity. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation,\nmedia attention, or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the UAS market. Future research reports,\nfindings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than,\nor that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for\nthe Company’s products and the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company.\nThe dependence upon customer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory\nproceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company, the demand for the Company’s products, and the business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows of the Company.\nFailure to manage our planned growth could place a significant strain on our resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective plan for managing our future\ngrowth. We plan to increase the scope of our operations. Current and future expansion efforts will be expensive and\nmay significantly strain our managerial and other resources and ability to manage working capital. To manage future\ngrowth effectively, we must manage expanded operations, integrate new personnel and maintain and enhance our\nfinancial and accounting systems and controls. If we do not manage growth properly, it could harm our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations and make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in achieving our organic growth strategies, which could limit our revenue growth or\nfinancial performance. Our ability to generate organic growth will be affected by our ability to, among other things:\n• attract new customers;\n• increase the number of products purchased from customers;\n• maintain profitable gross margins in the sale and maintenance of our products;\n• increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;\n18\n• achieve the estimated revenue we announced from new customer contracts;\n• hire and retain qualified employees;\n• expand the range of our products and services we offer to customers to address their evolving network\nneeds;\n• expand geographically, including internationally; and\n• address the challenges presented by difficult and unpredictable global and regional economic or market\nconditions that may affect us or our customers.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate organic growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot\nbe certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be attempted, realized or successful.\nIf we fail to retain our existing customers or do not acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue\nmay decrease and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nWe believe that our success is dependent on our ability to continue identifying and anticipating the needs of our\ncustomers, to retain our existing customers and to add new customers. For example, our business plan is designed\nto penetrate large, critical infrastructure end markets with our wireless and UAS driven data solutions and have\nexpanded our dedicated sales resources and field personnel to broaden our marketing and field support efforts into\nnew industries and sectors. As a result, we have significantly increased customer engagement in the transportation,\nsecurity and UAS end markets with Ondas Networks and in the industrial, public safety and government markets with\nOndas Autonomous Systems. We expect that our qualified customer pipeline will increase in other additional strategic\nend markets. However, as we become larger through organic growth, the growth rates for customer engagement,\nproject volume and average spend per customer may slow, even if we continue to add customers on an absolute basis.\nIn addition, the costs associated with customer retention may be substantially lower than costs associated with the\nacquisition of new customers. Therefore, our failure to retain existing customers, even if such losses are offset by an\nincrease in revenue resulting from the acquisition of new customers, could have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, while a key part of our business strategy is to add customers in our existing geographic markets,\nwe expect to expand our operations into new geographic markets. In doing so, we may incur losses or otherwise\nfail to enter new markets successfully. Our expansion into new markets may place us in unfamiliar and competitive\nenvironments and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that\nreturns on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all.\nThe Company faces uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy.\nAdverse changes in the economy could negatively impact the Company’s business. Future economic distress\nmay result in a decrease in demand for the Company’s products, which could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany’s operating results and financial condition. Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also\nincrease costs associated with developing and publishing products, increase the cost and decrease the availability of\nsources of financing, and increase the Company’s exposure to material losses from bad debts, any of which could have\na material adverse impact on the financial condition and operating results of the Company.\nWe may experience disruptions to our business operations as a result of war and hostilities in Israel.\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted\na series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the attacks, the Security Cabinet of the State\nof Israel declared a state of war in Israel. Since Airobotics is located in Israel, Company has considered various\nongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters, including: (i) approximately 17% of our workforce\nin Israel have been called to active duty; (ii) some of the Company’s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other\ncompanies in which the Company relies, are currently only partially active, as instructed by the relevant authorities\nor due to personnel shortages related to the war effort, which resulted in a temporary delay of inventory production;\nand (iii) there has been a slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel. In recent weeks, all of\nthe Company’s workforce in Israel returned to work and inventory production restraints have eased. The Company is\nclosely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect its anticipated milestones\n19\nand its Israel-based activities to support future operations, including the Company’s ability to import materials that\nare required to construct the Optimus System™ and to ship them outside of Israel. To date, we have not had material\ndisruptions to our ability to produce, manage and deliver products and services to customers as our U.S. teams have\nsupported our ongoing operations in Israel and the Middle East; however, a prolonged war or an escalation of the current\nconditions in Israel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Due\nto the recency of these events, and their ongoing and evolving nature, the extent of the adverse effect on our business\noperations is still unknown.\nWe have significant dependence on a small number of customers, and the loss of such customers or a decrease\nin business conducted with such customers could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nBecause we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number\nof customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2023,\nthree customers accounted approximately $6,703,000, $5,127,000, and $3,395,000 of our revenue or approximately\n43%, 33%, and 22%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately\n$1,893,000 of our revenue, or approximately 89%. The loss of the 2023 customers or a decrease in the business\nconducted with such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nProject performance delays or difficulties, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations\nmay result in additional costs to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.\nMany projects involve challenging engineering, construction or installation phases that may occur over extended\ntime periods. We may encounter difficulties as a result of delays or changes in designs, engineering information or\nmaterials provided by our customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule\nchanges, delays from our customer’s failure to timely obtain permits or meet other regulatory requirements including\nthe securing of necessary FCC certifications or FAA approvals, weather-related delays and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery\nschedule. In addition, we contract with third-party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts. Any\ndelay or failure by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may be beyond\nour control and may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs,\nor both. Delays and additional costs may be substantial, and, in some cases, we may be required to compensate the\ncustomer for such delays. Delays may also disrupt the final completion of our contracts as well as the corresponding\nrecognition of revenues and expenses therefrom. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a\nscheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels; failure to meet any\nof our guarantees, schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties to us,\nincluding obligations to pay liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme\ncases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may be unable to replace such projects\nwith similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation, brand or relationships with\ncustomers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.\nOur contractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these\nrelationships, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nWe depend on third party contractors to complete manufacturing, certain research and development and\ndeployment functions. There is a risk that we may have disputes with contractors arising from, among other things,\nthe quality and timeliness of work performed by the contractor, customer concerns about the contractor or our failure\nto extend existing task orders or issue new task orders. In addition, if any of our contractors fail to deliver on a timely\nbasis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, then our ability to fulfill our obligations may\nbe jeopardized. In addition, the absence of qualified contractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could\nadversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Any of these factors\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n20\nMaterial delays or defaults in customer payments could leave us unable to cover expenditures related to such\ncustomer’s projects, including the payment of our subcontractors.\nBecause of the nature of most of our contracts, we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from\nour customers in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. In certain cases, these expenditures\ninclude paying our contractors and purchasing parts. If a customer defaults in making its payments on a project or\nprojects to which we have devoted significant resources, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers may work on projects that are inherently\ndangerous, and a failure to maintain a safe worksite could result in significant losses.\nCertain of our project sites can place our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and others,\nincluding third parties, in difficult or dangerous environments, and may involve difficult and hard to reach terrain,\nhigh elevation, or locations near large or complex equipment, moving vehicles, high voltage or other safety hazards or\ndangerous processes. Safety is a primary focus of our business and maintaining a good reputation for safety is critical\nto our business. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. We\nmaintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures\nthroughout our company. Maintaining such programs involves variable costs which may increase as governmental,\nregulatory and industry safety standards evolve, and any increase in such costs may materially affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Further, if we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures or if our\nprocedures fail, our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers, including third parties, may suffer\ninjuries. Failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations, or the occurrence of such\ninjuries, could subject us to material losses and liability and may adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the\nfuture or to hire and retain talented officers, employees, contractors, and other services providers, therefore materially\nadversely affecting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWarranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nWe generally warrant our manufactured products, including hardware and software, for a period of one year\nfrom the date of receipt of the product by the customer. After the first year, the customer can pay for extended hardware\nwarranty and software maintenance and upgrades on an annual basis in advance. While costs that we have incurred\nhistorically under our warranty obligations have not been material, the costs associated with such warranties, including\nany warranty related legal proceedings, are variable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nOur products are subject to a lengthy sales cycle and our customers may cancel or change their product plans after\nwe have expended substantial time and resources in the design of their products.\nMany of our customers are conservative in their decision-making process. Sales cycles for new customers can\nvary from one to three years depending on the complexity of the customer’s network, whether the customer is subject\nto state regulations, and annual budget cycles. During this lengthy sales cycle, our potential customers may cancel\nor change their product plans. Customers may also discontinue products incorporating our devices at any time or\nthey may choose to replace our products with lower cost semiconductors. In addition, we are working with leading\ncustomers in our target markets to define our future products. If customers cancel, reduce or delay product orders from\nus, or choose not to release products that incorporate our devices after we have spent substantial time and resources\ndeveloping products or assisting customers with their product design, our revenue levels may be less than anticipated\nand our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing customers.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current and past customers to provide\npositive references to new, potential customers. A material portion of our current pipeline activity is concentrated in\nthe transportation and aviation sectors as well as in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Given our limited number of\ncustomers, the loss or dissatisfaction of any customer could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the\nmarket acceptance of our products and services, and impair our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing\n21\ncustomers. Further, as we expand into new vertical and geographic end markets, references from existing customers\ncould be similarly important. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIf our products contain defects or otherwise fail to perform as expected, we could be liable for damages and incur\nunanticipated warranty, recall and other related expenses, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose market\nshare and, as a result, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nOur products rely on complex avionics, sensors, user-friendly interfaces and tightly integrated, electromechanical\ndesigns to accomplish their missions. Our products may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of\nissues in design, materials, manufacture, deployment and/or use. If any of our products contain a defect, compatibility\nor interoperability issue or other error, we may have to devote significant time and resources to find and correct the\nissue. Such efforts could divert the attention of our management team and other relevant personnel from other important\ntasks. A product recall or a significant number of product returns could (i) be expensive; (ii) damage our reputation\nand relationships with utilities and other third-party vendors; (iii) result in the loss of business to competitors; and\n(iv) result in litigation against us. Costs associated with field replacement labor, hardware replacement, re-integration\nwith third-party products, handling charges, correcting defects, errors and bugs, or other issues could be significant\nand could materially harm our financial results.\nAs a manufacturer of UAV products, and with aircraft and aviation sector companies under increased scrutiny,\nclaims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our UAV products causes, or merely appears to have\ncaused, personal injury or death. In addition, defects in our products may lead to other potential life, health and\nproperty risks. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our\nmanagement and other resources.\nThe existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products or the misuse of our products could also lead\nto product liability claims or lawsuits against us. A defect, error or failure in one of our products could result in\ninjury, death or property damage and significantly damage our reputation and support for our products in general. We\nanticipate this risk will grow as our products begin to be used in U.S. domestic airspace and urban areas.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to\nprotect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance\nwill be available in the future at economical prices or at all. A successful product liability claim could result in\nsubstantial cost to us. Even if we are fully insured as it relates to a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our\nbrand and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nEstimated future product warranty claims are based on the expected number of field failures over the warranty\ncommitment period, the term of the product warranty period, and the costs for repair, replacement and other associated\ncosts. Our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates, claims levels, material usage and product\nre-integration and handling costs.\nBecause our products are relatively new and we do not yet have the benefit of long-term experience observing\nproducts’ performance in the field, our estimates of a product’s lifespan and incidence of claims may be inaccurate.\nShould actual product failure rates, claims levels, material usage, product re-integration and handling costs, defects,\nerrors, bugs or other issues differ from the original estimates, we could end up incurring materially higher warranty\nor recall expenses than we anticipate.\nOur Optimus System™ makes use of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled,\nhave occasionally been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames. If such events occur with our products,\nwe could face liability associated with our warranty, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety\nrecall, any of which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe battery packs in our Optimus™ drone use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop\ncomputers and cell phones. On occasion, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly\nrelease the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly\npublicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on\nthe safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of these lithium-ion cells for\n22\nautomotive applications. There can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur, which\nwould damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is\nsome risk of electrocution if individuals who attempt to repair battery packs on our vehicles do not follow applicable\nmaintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially\na safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nDue to the volatile and flammable nature of certain components of our products and equipment, fires or explosions\nmay disrupt our business or cause significant injuries, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe development and manufacture of certain of our products involves the handling of a variety of explosive\nand flammable materials as well as high power equipment. From time to time, these activities may result in incidents\nthat could cause us to temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt some manufacturing processes, causing production\ndelays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and/or fatalities. We have safety and loss prevention programs\nthat require detailed reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations\ninvolving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies, however our\ninsurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all claims and losses related to such incidents. We may experience\nsuch incidents in the future, which could result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nOur technology, products and services have only been developed in the last several years and we have had only\nlimited opportunities to deploy and assess their performance in the field at full scale.\nThe current generation of our FullMAX and Optimus System™ technology platforms have only been developed\nin the last several years and will continue to evolve. Deploying and operating our technology is complex and, until\nrecently, had been done primarily by a small number of customers. As the size, complexity and scope of our deployments\ngrow we have been able to test product performance at a greater scale and in a variety of new geographic settings and\nenvironmental conditions. As the number, size and complexity of our deployments grow and we deploy our technology\nplatforms for new applications in new critical infrastructure industries, we may encounter unforeseen operational,\ntechnical and other challenges, some of which could cause significant delays, trigger contractual penalties, result in\nunanticipated expenses, and/or damage to our reputation, each of which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to respond to evolving technological changes, our products and services could become obsolete or less\ncompetitive.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries characterized by new and rapidly evolving technologies, standards,\nregulations, customer requirements, as well as frequent product introductions and revisions. Accordingly, our\noperating results depend upon our ability to develop and introduce new products and services, our ability to reduce\nproduction costs of our existing products. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if\nwe are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing products and services or acceptable new\nproducts and services that keep pace with technological developments or industry standards, our products may become\nobsolete, less marketable and less competitive and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be\nsignificantly harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to develop new products and to enhance and sustain the quality of existing products.\nOur growth and future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design and manufacture new\ncompetitive products and to enhance and sustain the quality and marketability of our existing products. As such, we\nhave made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in technology development. In the future, we\nmay not have the necessary capital, or access to capital on acceptable terms, to fund necessary levels of research\nand development. Even with adequate capital resources, we may nonetheless experience unforeseen problems in the\ndevelopment or performance of our technologies or products. In addition, we may not meet our product development\nschedules and, even if we do, we may not develop new products fast enough to provide sufficient differentiation from\nour competitors’ products, which may be more successful.\n23\nWe expect to incur substantial research and development costs and devote significant resources to identifying and\ncommercializing new products and services, which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result\nin revenue to us.\nOur future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and\nnew environments, and introducing new products and services that achieve market acceptance. We plan to incur\nsubstantial research and development costs as part of our efforts to design, develop and commercialize new products\nand services and enhance existing products. For example, we will incur research and development costs to improve\nthe functionality of our acoustic DAA solution configuration in certain environments, in addition to integrating new\npayloads to broaden the functionality of our Optimus System™. Further, our research and development programs\nmay not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, create\nadditional revenue or become profitable, which could materially harm our business, prospects, financial results and\nliquidity.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers’ other systems, the purchase or deployment of our products\nand services may be delayed or cancelled.\nOur products are designed to interface with our customers’ other systems, each of which may have different\nspecifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Our products will be required to\ninteroperate with many or all of these products as well as future products in order to meet our customers’ requirements.\nIf we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ systems, we may need to\nmodify our products or services to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing\nsoftware and hardware, which could be costly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. In addition, if our products and services do not interoperate with our customers’ systems, customers may\nseek to hold us liable, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be delayed\nor cancelled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation or brand, and seriously harm our prospects,\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a competitive market.\nThe Company faces competition and new competitors will continue to emerge throughout the world. Services\noffered by the Company’s competitors may take a larger share of customer spending than anticipated, which could\ncause revenue generated from the Company’s products and services to fall below expectations. It is expected that\ncompetition in these markets will intensify. If competitors of the Company develop and market more successful\nproducts or services, offer competitive products or services at lower price points, or if the Company does not produce\nconsistently high-quality and well-received products and services, revenues, margins, and profitability of the Company\nwill decline.\nThe Company’s ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, the Company’s pricing of\nservices and equipment, quality of customer service and field support, development of new and enhanced products\nand services in response to customer demands and changing technology, reach and quality of sales and distribution\nchannels and capital resources. Competition could lead to a reduction in the rate at which the Company adds new\ncustomers, a decrease in the size of the Company’s market share and a decline in its customers.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more\nkey officers, employees, contractors and other service providers or our inability to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend, in part, on the performance of Eric Brock, our Chief Executive Officer and President, Yishay\nCurelaru, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Menashe Shahar, the Chief Technology Officer of\nOndas Networks, and Meir Kliner the President of Ondas Autonomous Systems to operate and grow our business. The\nloss of any of Messrs. Brock, Curelaru, Shahar, or Kliner could negatively impact our ability to execute our business\nstrategies. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Brock, Curelaru, Shahar, and Kliner,\nwe may be unable to retain them or replace any of them if we lose their services for any reason.\n24\nOur future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management,\nproduct development, operations, sales, technical and other personnel in the United States and abroad. Even in today’s\neconomic climate, competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. Given the lengthy\nsales cycles with utilities and deployment periods of our networking platform and solutions, the loss of key personnel\nat any time could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCyberattacks through security vulnerabilities could lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs,\nliability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\nSecurity vulnerabilities may arise from our hardware, software, employees, contractors or policies we have\ndeployed, which may result in external parties gaining access to our networks, datacenters, cloud datacenters, corporate\ncomputers, manufacturing systems, and or access to accounts we have at our suppliers, vendors, and customers. They\nmay gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or attack the networks causing denial of service or attempt\nto hold our data or systems in ransom. The vulnerability could be caused by inadequate account security practices such\nas failure to timely remove employee access when terminated. To mitigate these security issues, we have implemented\nmeasures throughout our organization, including firewalls, backups, encryption, employee information technology\npolicies and user account policies. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be sufficient to avoid\ncyberattacks. If any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data,\nour relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation could be\nmaterially harmed, and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability.\nFurther, if we fail to adequately maintain our infrastructure, we may have outages and data loss. Excessive\noutages may affect our ability to timely and efficiently deliver products to customers or develop new products and\nsolutions. Such disruptions and data loss may adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders, patent our intellectual\nproperty or protect our source code, and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these\ndisruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf,\nwhether through breach of our systems, breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or\nthrough employee or contractor error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized\nuse or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted,\nand we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations, related actions, and\npenalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and\nentities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to\nthe unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized\naccess to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract\nand retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control certain aspects of the manufacturing process.\nOur reliance on a small number of manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing\nus to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs and product supply including delays in\ntransportation and delivery. Any manufacturing disruption by our usual manufacturers could impair our ability to\nfulfill orders. We may be unable to manage our relationships with our usual manufacturers effectively as they may\nexperience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or\notherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery. Similarly, to the extent that our usual manufacturers\nprocure materials on our behalf, we may not benefit from any warranties received by our usual manufacturers from\nthe suppliers or otherwise have recourse against the original supplier of the materials or even the manufacturer. In\nsuch circumstances, if the original supplier were to provide us or our usual manufacturers with faulty materials, we\nmight not be able to recover the costs of such materials or be compensated for any damages that arise as a result of the\ninclusion of the faulty components in our products.\nOne or more of our usual manufacturers may suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays,\ndisruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, or seek to terminate its relationship with us,\nor we may choose to change or add additional manufacturers for other reasons. Additionally, we do not have long-term\nsupply agreements with our usual manufacturers. As a result, we may be unable to renew or extend our agreement\n25\non terms favorable to us, if at all. Although the manufacturing services required to manufacture and assemble our\nproducts may be readily available from a number of established manufacturers, it may be risky, time consuming and\ncostly to qualify and implement new manufacturer relationships.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs\nbecome scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in\ncompleting our development programs, which could damage our business.\nIn order to produce our Optimus System™ and related safety systems, we obtain certain hardware components,\nas well as subsystems and systems from a limited group of suppliers, some of which are sole source suppliers. We\ndo not have long-term agreements with any of these suppliers that obligate them to continue to sell components,\nsubsystems, systems or products to us. Our reliance on these suppliers involves significant risks and uncertainties,\nincluding whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required components, subsystems, or systems of\nsufficient quality, will increase prices for the components, subsystems or systems and will perform their obligations\non a timely basis.\nIn addition, certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products and in our development\nprograms, are periodically subject to supply shortages, and our business is subject to the risk of price increases and\nperiodic delays in delivery. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and\na global shortage of semiconductors, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers’ continued production of\nkey components for our products. If any additional shortages occur and we are unable to obtain components from third\nparty suppliers in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, then we\nmay not be able to timely complete development programs or deliver our products on a timely or cost effective basis\nto our customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with us, increase our costs and seriously\nharm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially\nunstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to\nfind new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products\nto accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and\nshipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish\nalternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing which exposes us to fluctuations in\ncomponent, materials and equipment prices. Substantial increases in these prices would increase our operating\ncosts and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nBecause we currently do not have long-term supply contracts with guaranteed pricing, we are subject to\nfluctuations in the prices of the raw materials, parts and components and equipment we use in the production of our\nOptimus System™. Substantial increases in the prices for such raw materials, components and equipment would\nincrease our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased\nprices. Any attempts to increase prices of our automated data solutions in response to increased costs could be viewed\nnegatively by our customers and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nWe may pursue additional strategic transactions in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our\nbusiness or change our business profile significantly.\nWe intend to consider additional potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses\nor assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies that expand, complement or otherwise\nrelate to our current or future business. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint\nventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. Should our\nrelationships fail to materialize into significant agreements, or should we fail to work efficiently with these companies,\nwe may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial condition could\nbe adversely affected.\n26\nThese activities, if successful, create risks such as, among others: (i) the need to integrate and manage the\nbusinesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources,\nsystems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable\nliabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management’s attention from other business\nconcerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of\ndebt or equity securities; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration;\nand (c) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time\ncharges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of our existing shareholders or result in the\nissuance of, or assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations\nmay involve significant commitments of financial and other resources. Any such activities may not be successful in\ngenerating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed to such activities will not be available\nto us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we\nmay not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure.\nOur inability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in\nbusinesses may negatively affect our operating results.\nAdditionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment,\nor charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings.\nFuture acquisitions or joint ventures may not result in their anticipated benefits, and we may not be able to properly\nintegrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations or successfully\ncombine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions.\nIf the Company is required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company’s financial condition\nand results could be negatively affected.\nGoodwill impairment arises when there is deterioration in the capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash\nflows, and the fair value of the goodwill dips below its book value. The Company is required to review its goodwill\nfor impairment at least annually. Events that may trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic\nconditions, increased competition, loss of key personnel, and regulatory action. Should any of these occur, an\nimpairment of goodwill could have a negative effect on the assets of the Company.\nIn December 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative analysis and proceeded directly to a quantitative\nanalysis. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the Ondas Autonomous\nSystems reporting unit. Using a discounted cash flow analysis and updated forecasts for revenue and cash flows, it\nwas determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of December 31, 2023,\nand no further impairment to goodwill was necessary as of December 31, 2023. See Note 5 — Goodwill and Business\nAcquisition of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment\nof goodwill.\nWar, terrorism, and other acts of violence may affect the markets in which we operate, our clients and our product\nand service delivery.\nOur business may be adversely affected by regional or global instability, disruption or destruction, regardless\nof cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. For example, the significant military action\nagainst Ukraine launched by Russia may affect the markets in which we operate. Such events may cause clients to delay\ntheir decisions on spending for the products and services provided by us and give rise to sudden significant changes in\nregional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events pose risks which could materially adversely affect\nour financial results.\nWe may not be able to secure adequate insurance policies, or secure insurance policies at reasonable prices.\nWe maintain general liability insurance, aviation flight testing insurance, aircraft liability coverage, directors\nand officers insurance, and other insurance policies and we believe our level of coverage is customary in the industry\nand adequate to protect against claims. However, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential\nclaims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost. Further, we expect our\ninsurance needs and costs to increase as we grow our commercial operations and expand into new markets and it is\nuncertain if such insurance will be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n27\nThe Company will be affected by operational risks and may not be adequately insured for certain risks.\nThe Company will be affected by a number of operational risks and the Company may not be adequately insured\nfor certain risks, including: labor disputes; catastrophic accidents; fires; blockades or other acts of social activism;\nchanges in the regulatory environment; impact of non-compliance with laws and regulations; natural phenomena, such\nas inclement weather conditions, floods, earthquakes and ground movements. There is no assurance that the foregoing\nrisks and hazards will not result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s technologies, personal injury or death,\nenvironmental damage, adverse impacts on the Company’s operation, costs, monetary losses, potential legal liability\nand adverse governmental action, any of which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows,\nearnings and financial condition. Furthermore, the unmanned aerial systems industry lacks a formative insurance\nmarket. As a result, the Company may be subject to or affected by liability or sustain loss for certain risks and hazards\nagainst which the Company cannot insure or which the Company may elect not to insure because of the cost. This\nlack of insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on the Company’s future cash flows, earnings, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that\nmay result in liability material to our financial condition as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if\nchanges to our business operations are required. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require\na significant diversion of our resources, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully defend against\nany such litigation regardless of particular merits. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that\ncould negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether\nwe are ultimately found liable. Insurance may not be available on favorable terms, at all, or in sufficient amounts to\ncover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance\ncoverage for any claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.\nOur cash could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fail.\nThe Company maintains domestic cash deposits in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured\nbanks. The domestic bank deposit balances may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. Also, in the foreign markets we\nserve, we also maintain cash deposits in foreign banks, some of which are not insured or partially insured by the FDIC\nor other similar agency. These balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions in which we\ndeposit monies fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Requirements\nWe and our customers operate in a highly regulated business environment and changes in regulation could impose\ncosts on us or make our products less economical.\nOur products and services and our utility customers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and\nregulations. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our products govern, among other things, the manner in which\nour products communicate, and the environmental impact and electrical reliability of our products. Additionally, our\ncritical infrastructure customers are often regulated by national, state and/or local bodies, including public utility\ncommissions, the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the FAA, the FCC, Federal\nRail Association, Israeli Defense Export Controls Agency of the Ministry of Defense and other bodies. Prospective\ncustomers may be required to gain approval from any or all of these organizations prior to implementing our products\nand services, including specific permissions related to the cost recovery of these systems. Regulatory agencies may\nimpose special requirements for implementation and operation of our products, which may result in unforeseen\ndelays. We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations applicable to us or our\nutility customers. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving\nregulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed on us or our utility customers in the future. Such costs\ncould make our products less economical and could impact our utility customers’ willingness to adopt our products,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.\n28\nFurthermore, changes in the underlying regulatory conditions that affect critical infrastructure industries could\nhave a potentially adverse effect on our customers’ interest or ability to implement our technologies. Many regulatory\njurisdictions have implemented rules that provide financial incentives for the implementation of energy efficiency\nand demand response technologies, often by providing rebates or through the restructuring of utility rates. If these\nprograms were to cease, or if they were restructured in a manner inconsistent with the capabilities enabled by our\nproducts and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nFailure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put\non the use of small UAS in response to public privacy and other concerns, may prevent us from expanding the sales\nof our drone solutions to industrial and government customers in the United States.\nThe regulation of small UAS for commercial use in the United States is undergoing substantial change and the\nultimate treatment is uncertain.\nOn February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was enacted, establishing various\ndeadlines for the FAA to allow expanded use of small UAS for both public and commercial applications. On June 21,\n2016, the FAA released its final rules regarding the routine use of certain small UAS (under 55 pounds) in the\nU.S. National Airspace System pursuant to the act (the “Part 107 Rules”). The Part 107 Rules, which became effective\nin August 2016, provided safety regulations for small UAS conducting non-recreational operations and contain\nvarious limitations and restrictions for such operations, including a requirement that operators keep UAS within\nvisual-line-of-sight and prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly participating\nin the operation of the UAS. On December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules requiring remote identification\nof drones and allowing operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. On June 8,\n2021, the FAA announced the formation of an Aviation Rulemaking Committee (“ARC”) to develop new rules to\nfurther define regulations for the operations of UAS Beyond Visual Line-of-Site (“BVLOS”). The timing of additional\nrulemaking is uncertain as is the outcome of the still developing regulatory environment related to the operation of\nsmall UAS.\nWe cannot assure you that any final rules enacted in furtherance of the FAA’s announced proposals will result\nin the expanded use of our drones and drone solutions by commercial and industrial entities. In addition, there exists\npublic concern regarding the privacy and other implications of U.S. commercial use of small UAS. This concern has\nincluded calls to develop explicit written policies and procedures establishing usage limitations. We cannot assure you\nthat the response from regulatory agencies, customers and privacy advocates to these concerns will not delay or restrict\nthe adoption of small UAS by the commercial use markets.\nSubstantially all our current products depend on the availability and are subject to the use of licensed radio\nfrequencies regulated by the FCC in the United States.\nSubstantially all of our current wireless networking products are designed to communicate wirelessly via licensed\nradio frequencies and therefore depend on the availability of adequate radio spectrum in order to operate. It is possible\nthat the FCC or the U.S. Congress could adopt additional regulations or policies which are or may change or modify\ncurrent regulations or policies so that they are, harmful to our business or incompatible with our current or future\nproduct offerings, as well as products currently installed in the field. Additional regulations or policies or changes or\nmodifications to current regulations or policies may require modification or replacement of our products, including\nproducts currently installed in the field, at significant, or even prohibitive, cost to us, and may require changes or\nmodifications to, or termination of, ongoing or planned projects. Any of these developments could materially and\nadversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer of commercial UAS, we are subject to various government regulations, restrictions and\nrequirements, and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to\nsanctions or otherwise harm, restrict or add costs to our business.\nAs a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, restrictions and\nrequirements, including, in the United States, those issued under the Consumer Products Safety Act, as well as those\nissued under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. Failure to comply with any\napplicable product safety or consumer protection regulation could result in sanctions that could have a negative impact\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n29\nGovernments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional\nregulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for\nfailure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers\nmight require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such\nadditional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for\nnon-compliance could subject us to greater expenses in the event any of our products were found to not comply with\nsuch regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and international laws regarding data protection, privacy, and information\nsecurity, as well as confidentiality obligations under various agreements, and our actual or perceived failure to\ncomply with such obligations could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation risk and adversely affect our\nbusiness and operating results.\nIn connection with our business, we receive, collect, process and retain certain sensitive and confidential\ncustomer information. As a result, we are subject to increasingly rigorous federal, state and international laws regarding\nprivacy and data protection. Personal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the\nUnited States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for\nprivacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nOur handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government\nagencies, including the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state, local and foreign bodies\nand agencies. We also execute confidentiality agreements with various parties under which we are required to protect\ntheir confidential information.\nThe United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations\non the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and\nemployees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorney generals are applying federal and state consumer\nprotection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and\ngovernmental bodies, and other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations\nconcerning the collection and use of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating\nwithin their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such\nlaws and regulations may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals\nto access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of\nsecurity breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals’ consent to use personal\ninformation for certain purposes.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning\nprivacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions,\nand we cannot yet determine the impact of such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For\nexample, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective in 2020, provides new data privacy rights for\nconsumers and new operational requirements for companies. Additionally, we expect that existing laws, regulations\nand standards may be interpreted differently in the future. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the\nregulatory framework for the future of personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States with\nregulations such as the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which imposes more stringent\nEuropean Union data protection requirements, provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for\nnoncompliance. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, including the adoption of the GDPR, as well\nas changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability\nto collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require\nus to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base\nand increase our revenue.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry\nstandards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, such laws, regulations, standards and\nobligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction\nto another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features\nof our products. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards,\ncontractual obligations and other legal obligations, and our efforts to do so may cause us to incur significant costs\nor require changes to our business practices, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any\n30\nfailure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards,\ncontractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting\nin unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in\ngovernmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and\ncould cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any\ninability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws,\nregulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional\ncost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes, and we could be harmed by changes to, or the interpretation\nor the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nIn addition to the United States, Airobotics operates in Israel, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The\ninternational scope of Airobotics’ business requires us to comply with a wide range of national and local laws and\nregulations, which may in certain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other.\nWith the geographic expansion of our business, and that of our subsidiaries, into new markets, we have become\nsubject to additional and changing legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards.\nIn countries where we operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new interpretations of existing\nlaws and regulations or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning our business. Changes in government\nregulation of or successful challenges to the business model used by us in certain markets may require us to change\nour existing business models and operations. Any additional regulatory scrutiny or changes in legal requirements\nmay impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate in all of the current\nmarkets or to expand in accordance with our strategy, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or\nconflict between different operating countries. This may negatively impact our revenue and profitability by preventing\nour business from reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur\nadditional costs, which would adversely impact business. Our inability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing\nor new compliance obligations, could lead to regulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement\naction, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings and adversely affect our business.\nWe may become subject to increasing global trade laws and regulations.\nWe may become subject to increasing global trade laws and regulations, including economic sanctions, export\ncontrols, and import laws. Failure to comply with global trade laws and regulations can result in penalties and\nreputational harm. Our international sales efforts expose us to increased risk under these laws and regulations, and\nincreasing and evolving global trade laws could impact our business.\nWe are subject to Israeli regulations, restrictions and requirements which could adversely affect our business and\noperating results.\nRestrictions imposed on us by the Government of Israel, as a result of strategic ties and treaties with foreign\ncountries, limit our activities and access to certain countries, in a manner that may restrict and even prevent in certain\nsituations our operations in certain countries and affect its results.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain.\nWe rely primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure\nagreements, to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property. As of this filing, the Ondas Networks\nsegment held a total of seven issued patents in the U.S., three issued international patents, four patent pending\napplications in the U.S., and nine international pending patent application. The Ondas Networks segment patents\nexpire between 2029 and 2040, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. As of this\nfiling, the Ondas Autonomous Systems segment held a total of six issued patents in the U.S., 22 issued international\npatents, and five international pending patent applications. The Ondas Autonomous Systems segment patents expire\nbetween 2034 and 2048, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. Our intellectual\n31\nproperty incorporates internally developed software and hardware design incorporating machine and computer vision\nand was developed with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This intellectual property is critical\nto the development of end-to-end systems which reliably enable the automated operation of drones in real-world\nenvironments.\nWe have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes.\nCurrently, several of our issued U.S. patents as well as various pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relate to\nour FullMAX systems, Optimus System™, and Iron Drone Raider™ and are therefore important to the functionality\nof our products. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded from doing so\nat a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved in a timely\nmanner or at all. The rights granted to us under our patents, and the rights we are seeking to have granted in our\npending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage. In addition, those\nrights could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors, or be declared invalid or unenforceable in\njudicial or administrative proceedings. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it\neasier or cheaper for our competitors to offer the same or similar products or technologies. Even if we are successful\nin receiving patent protection for certain products and processes, our competitors may be able to design around our\npatents or develop products that provide outcomes which are comparable or superior to ours without infringing on our\nintellectual property rights. Due to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual property\nrights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if\npatents are granted outside the U.S., effective enforcement in those countries may not be available without significant\ncost and time expense or at all.\nWe rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors.\nThird parties may challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged,\nwe could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to\ndevote additional resources to marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe\nupon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protectable by patents, to maintain our\ncompetitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual\nproperty assignment agreements with our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers regarding our\nintellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of those\nagreements, we may not be provided with meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nIn addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the\nextent that our commercial partners, collaborators, officers, employees, contractors and other service providers use\nintellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in the related or resulting\nknow-how and inventions. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other technologies not protected by a patent were to\nbe disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nIf a competitor infringes upon one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing\nthose patents, trademarks and other rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. Patent law relating to the scope\nof claims in the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change and constant evolution and, consequently,\npatent positions in our industry can be uncertain. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents and trademarks\nagainst challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could\ndivert management’s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources or desire\nto defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation also\nputs our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nAdditionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we\ninitiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any\nof these events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n32\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or found that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and by litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups\nhave purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order\nto extract settlements from companies like ours. To date we have received no claims with respect to our infringement\nof intellectual property or patents but, in the future, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their patents\nor other intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be or may become contractually obligated to indemnify our\nutility customers or other third parties that use or resell our products in the event our products are alleged to infringe a\nthird-party’s intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming,\ncostly to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and\ncause us to incur significant expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may\nbe unable to uphold its contractual obligations. Further, claims of intellectual property infringement might require\nus to redesign affected products, delay affected product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements\nor pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing, selling or\ndistributing the affected products. If we cannot or do not license the alleged infringed technology on reasonable terms\nor at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, our utility customers may not purchase our products if they are concerned that our products infringe\nthird-party intellectual property rights. This could reduce the market opportunity for the sale of our products and\nservices. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and\nproducts could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented technology, trade secrets and know-how. We\ngenerally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements\nwith our officers, employees, contractors and other service providers and with parties with which we do business.\nThese agreements may be breached, which breach may result in the misappropriation of such information, and we\nmay not have adequate remedies for any such breach. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent\nunauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology.\nMoreover, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by\ncompetitors. To the extent that our officers, employees, contractors, other service providers, or other third parties with\nwhom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights\nin related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed\nor misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe use open-source software in our products and services that may subject our products and services to general\nrelease or require us to re-engineer our products and services, which may cause harm to our business.\nWe use open-source software in connection with our products and services. From time to time, companies that\nincorporate open-source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source\nsoftware and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming\nownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. Some\nopen-source software licenses require users who distribute open-source software as part of their software to publicly\ndisclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open-source\ncode on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software in our products and services\nand try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related product\nor that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we\nmay be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our products,\ndiscontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other\nremedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\n33\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual\nproperty rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive\nadvantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n• others may be able to make devices that are the same as or similar to our remote radios but that are not\ncovered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n• we or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents\nor pending patent applications that we own;\n• we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n• others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies\nwithout infringing our intellectual property rights;\n• it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n• issued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or\nunenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n• our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that\nprovide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as\nwell as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such\nactivities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n• we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results\nWe will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitable operations.\nWe intend to increase our operating expenses substantially in connection with the planned expansion of our\nbusiness, establishment of our sales and marketing infrastructure, our ongoing research and development activities,\nand the commensurate development of our management and administrative functions, but there is no guarantee that we\nwill succeed in these endeavors. We will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be\nable to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability\non a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we expect, or if our operating expenses\nexceed our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur future profitability may be dependent upon achieving cost reductions and projected economies of scale from\nincreasing manufacturing quantities of our products. Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs\nand projected economies of scale could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities\nand processes that will enable us to manufacture (or contract for the manufacture of) these products in commercial\nquantities while meeting the volume, speed, quality, price, engineering, design and production standards required to\nsuccessfully market our products. Our failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities in locations\nthat can efficiently service our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects. Our future profitability is, in part, dependent upon achieving increased savings from\nvolume purchases of raw materials and component parts, achieving acceptable manufacturing yield and capitalizing\non machinery efficiencies. We expect our suppliers to experience a sharp increase in demand for their products. As a\nresult, we may not have reliable access to supplies that we require or be able to purchase such materials or components\nat cost effective prices. There is no assurance that we will ever be in a position to realize any material, labor and\nmachinery cost reductions associated with higher purchasing power and higher production levels. Failure to achieve\nthese cost reductions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\n34\nIf business growth falls short of expectations, we may need to obtain additional capital to fund our growth,\noperations, and obligations.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our growth, operations, and obligations if our growth plan falls short\nor takes more time than we anticipate. As our business has grown, we have managed periods of tight liquidity by\naccessing capital from our stockholders and their affiliates. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors,\nincluding:\n• our ability to enter into new agreements with customers or to extend the terms of our existing agreements\nwith customers, and the terms of such agreements;\n• the success of our sales efforts;\n• our working capital requirements related to the costs of inventory and accounts receivable;\n• costs of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel;\n• expenditures and investments to implement our business strategy; and\n• the identification and successful completion of acquisitions.\nWe may seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable,\nlines of credit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially\nacceptable terms or at all, when needed. For example, increases in interest rates could negatively impact the costs\nof seeking additional funds through debt offerings and/or borrowings. If adequate funds are not available or are not\navailable on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or\notherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenue is not predictable and recognition of a significant portion of it will be deferred into future periods.\nOnce a customer decides to move forward with a large-scale deployment of our products and services, the timing\nof and our ability to recognize related revenue will depend on several factors, some of which may not be under our\ncontrol. These factors include shipment schedules that may be delayed or subject to modification, the rate at which\nour utility customers choose to deploy our products in their network, customer acceptance of all or any part of our\nproducts and services, our contractual commitments to provide new or enhanced functionality at some point in the\nfuture, other contractual provisions such as liquidated damages, our suppliers’ ability to provide an adequate supply\nof components, the requirement to obtain regulatory approval, and our ability to deliver quality products according to\nexpected schedules. In light of these factors, the application of complex revenue recognition rules to our products and\nservices has required us to defer, and in the future will likely continue to require us to defer, a significant amount of\nrevenue until undetermined future periods. It may be difficult to predict the amount of revenue that we will recognize\nin any given period and amounts recognized may fluctuate significantly from one period to the next.\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition of Airobotics, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates has increased.\nAirobotics conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States, which also operate in\ntheir respective local currencies, the most significant of which are currently the Israeli New Shekel, the Singapore\nDollar and the Emirati Dirham. Therefore, following the completion of the acquisition of Airobotics, our international\noperations accounts for a more significant portion of our overall operations than they previously did and our exposure to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increase. Because our financial statements continue to be presented\nin U.S. dollars, the local currencies of Airobotics will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for\ninclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\n35\nIf our internal controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may\nnot be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner,\nwhich may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in\nour stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires that we\nevaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management\nreport on the internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent\npublic accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to\nbe material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if\nwe or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be\nmaterial weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions\nor investigations by regulatory authorities, including SEC enforcement actions, and we could be required to restate our\nfinancial results, any of which would require additional financial and management resources.\nIf material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our\nconsolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial\nresults, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict\nour ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness,\nsubject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe continue to invest in more robust technology and resources to manage those reporting requirements.\nImplementing the appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, result in\nsubstantial costs and require significant time to complete. Any difficulties or delays in implementing these controls\ncould impact our ability to timely report our financial results. For these reasons, we may encounter difficulties in the\ntimely and accurate reporting of our financial results, which would impact our ability to provide our investors with\ninformation in a timely manner. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information,\nand our stock price could decline.\nIn addition, any such changes do not guarantee that we will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our\ninternal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial\nresults.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe have limited trading activity and as a result, the price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly, and\nyou could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe limited trading activity and resulting volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you\nfrom being able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares. The trading\nprice of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors,\nincluding, but not limited to:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n• adverse results from delays in our product development;\n• legal, political, governmental or other regulatory developments, decisions or interpretations;\n• publication of research reports or coverage about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations;\n• perceptions about the market acceptance of our products and services, and the recognition of our brand;\n• adverse publicity about our products and services, operating or financial results or industry in general;\n• overall performance of the equity markets;\n• introduction or discontinuation of products or services, or announcements of significant contracts, licenses\nor acquisitions, by us or our competitors;\n36\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• threatened or actual litigation and government or regulatory investigations;\n• sale of shares of our common stock by us or members of our management or our stockholders; and\n• general economic conditions, both global and regional.\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”) under the symbol “ONDS.”\nThe first trading day of the Company’s shares on TASE was January 26, 2023. There can be no assurance that trading\nof our common stock on such market will be sustained. On February 8, 2024, we took the steps to voluntarily delist\nour common stock from trading on the TASE. Pursuant to Israeli law, the delisting of our common stock is expected\nto take effect three months following the date of our request to TASE to delist our common stock, which occurred on\nFebruary 8, 2024. Following the delisting from TASE, our common stock will solely be trading on Nasdaq. In the event\nthat our common stock is not listed on Nasdaq, or if we do not sustain such listing, our common stock could be quoted\nonly on the OTC Markets. Under such circumstances, you may find it significantly more difficult to trade, or to obtain\naccurate quotations for our common stock and our common stock may become substantially less attractive to certain\npurchasers, such as financial institutions, hedge funds, and other similar investors.\nThese and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate unpredictably and\nsubstantially, which may negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in recent years, the stock\nmarket has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the\nmarket price of securities issued by many companies across many industries, including our industry. The changes\nfrequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the\nprice of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and\nthese fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the\noverall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result\nin substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal\nstockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their\nrespective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 15.6% of our outstanding common stock as\nof March 27, 2024, and as of the date of this filing. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to\nsignificantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any\nmerger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions.\nSome of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, they may be more\ninterested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that\ndeviate from the interests of other stockholders.\nWe may issue more shares to raise additional capital, which may result in substantial dilution.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of a maximum of 300,000,000 shares\nof common stock. Any additional financings effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without\nstockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing\nstockholders. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock\nor other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may be higher or lower\nthan the price per share of our common stock at that time. Also, we have reserved 8,000,000 and 3,333,334 shares\nof common stock for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Ondas Holdings Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan\n(the “2021 Plan”) and 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the\nnumber of securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2021 Plan and 2018 Plan is 3,780,741 and\n1,052,373 shares of common stock, respectively. The issuance of such additional shares of common stock, or securities\n37\nconvertible or exchangeable into common stock, may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Additionally,\nif all or a substantial portion of these shares are resold into the public markets then the trading price of our common\nstock may decline.\nOur Board may issue and fix the terms of shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could\nadversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock or any change in control of our Company.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of “blank\ncheck” preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined\nfrom time to time by our Board. Our Board is empowered, without the need to obtain stockholder approval, to issue\nshares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the\nvoting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of such issuances, the preferred stock\ncould be used, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control\nof our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our\nbusiness, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business, which research and reports are not and would not be subject to our\ncontrol. We currently do not have and may never obtain research coverage by securities analysts, and industry analysts\nthat currently cover us may cease to do so. If no securities analysts commence coverage of our company, or if industry\nanalysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIn the event we obtain securities analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock\nor publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may be materially and adversely\nimpacted. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly,\ndemand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock nor are we under any obligation to declare or\npay such cash dividends. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and the development\nand growth of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Our\nfuture ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be limited by any future debt instruments or preferred\nsecurities. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of\nour common stock increases to a price above the price you paid for them and you sell such shares.\nOur shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny\nstocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on\ncertain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided\nthat current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange\nor system. If the price per share of our common stock continues to be is less than $5.00, our common stock will\ncontinue to be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny\nstock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified\ninformation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not\notherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is\na suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk\ndisclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy\nof a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity\nin the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\n38\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make\nit more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a\ntransaction were in the stockholders’ best interest.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Nevada law make it\nmore difficult for a third-party to acquire us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction\nwere in the stockholders’ best interest. For example, Nevada law provides that approval of two-thirds of the stockholders\nis required to remove a director, which may make it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of the Company.\nThis concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by our minority stockholders.\nOur bylaws designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and\nexclusive forum for certain actions, which could limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that\nit finds favorable for disputes with the Company and its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage\nlawsuits with respect to such claims.\nUnless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark\nCounty of the State of Nevada (the “Court”) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a\nbeneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director, officer or other employee of the Company to\nthe Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company, any director or\nthe Company’s officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the “NRS”),\nChapters 78 or 92A of the NRS or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws, or (iv) any\naction asserting a claim against the Company, any director or the Company’s officers or employees governed by the\ninternal affairs doctrine. However, each of these clauses (i) through (iv) will not apply to any claim (x) as to which the\nCourt determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court (and the indispensable\nparty does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court within ten (10) days following such determination),\n(y) for which the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (z) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction\nof a court or forum other than the Court, including pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act, which provides for\nexclusive federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the\nrules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities\nAct”), provides for concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or\nliability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and as such the exclusive jurisdiction\nclauses set forth above would not apply to such suits.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nWe may not have the ability to pay interest on the Notes or to redeem the Notes.\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of 3% per year and add amortization payments with respect to the principal\namount of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable monthly. If we are unable to satisfy certain\nequity conditions, we will be required to pay all amounts due on any installment date in cash. If a change of control\noccurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Notes. Our ability to pay\namortization payments and interest on the Notes, to repurchase the Notes, to fund working capital needs, and fund\nplanned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, this is subject\nto general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, and other factors that are beyond our\ncontrol. We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will\ncontinue to generate cash flow from operations at a level sufficient to permit us to pay the interest on the Notes or to\nrepurchase or redeem the Notes or that our cash needs will not increase.\nThe holder of the Notes can defer an installment payment due on any installment date to another installment\ndate and may, on any installment date accelerate the payment of amounts due on up to four future installment dates.\nTherefore, we may be required to repay the entire principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in one\nlump sum on the maturity date of the Notes. If we are unable to satisfy certain equity conditions, we will be required\nto pay all amounts due whether by deferral or acceleration in cash and we may not have sufficient funds to repay the\nNotes under such circumstances.\n39\nOur failure to make the required payments on the Notes would permit the holders of the Notes to accelerate our\nobligations under the Notes. Such default may also lead to a default under our agreements governing any of our current\nand future indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations in the future to service our indebtedness\nand meet our other needs, we may have to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, obtain additional financing,\nreduce expenditures, or sell assets that we deem necessary to our business. We cannot assure you that any of these\nmeasures would be possible or that additional financing could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. The inability\nto obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and our ability to meet our obligations to you under the Notes.\nProvisions in the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\nUnder the terms of the Notes we are prohibited from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among\nother things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions could prevent\nor deter a third party from acquiring us, even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you.\nFuture sales of a significant number of our shares of Common Stock in the public markets, or the perception that\nsuch sales could occur, could depress the market price of our shares of Common Stock or cause it to be highly\nvolatile.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders, unless\nwe satisfy any such conversions solely with cash, and conversions of such Notes into shares of our Common Stock\ncould depress the price of our Common Stock. We cannot predict if and when these shares of our Common Stock will\nbe resold in the public markets. We cannot predict the number of these shares that might be resold nor the effect that\nfuture sales of our shares of Common Stock would have on the market price of our shares of Common Stock. Sales\nof a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could\noccur, may result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock or cause it to be highly volatile and impair\nour ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur financing arrangements contain, and we expect that other future loan agreements and financing arrangements\nwill contain, customary covenants that may limit our liquidity and corporate activities, which could limit our\noperational flexibility and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial arrangements contain, and we expect that other future loan agreements and financing arrangements\nwill contain, customary covenants and event of default clauses, which may affect operational and financial flexibility.\nSuch restrictions could affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends,\nincur additional indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, or engage in mergers or acquisitions. These restrictions could\nlimit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict\ncorporate activities. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our\nfuture operations or capital needs.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some\ncorporate actions. Our lenders’ interests may be different from ours and we may not be able to obtain their permission\nwhen needed. This may prevent us from taking actions that we believe are in our best interests, which may adversely\nimpact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor more information regarding our obligations under the Notes please see Note 9 — Long-term Notes Payable\nin the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements\nand the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current\nexpectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our\nactual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nOndas Holdings Inc. (“Ondas Holdings,” “Ondas,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is a leading provider of private\nwireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries Ondas Networks Inc. (“Ondas Networks”),\nOndas Autonomous Holdings Inc. (“OAH”), Airobotics, Ltd. (“Airobotics”), and American Robotics, Inc. (“American\nRobotics” or “AR”). Airobotics is an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone systems. American Robotics is a\nleading developer of highly automated commercial drone systems. Airobotics and American Robotics operate together\nunder OAH a separate business unit called Ondas Autonomous Systems. Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous\nSystems together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure and government markets\nwith improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information processing capabilities.\n43\nWe operate Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as separate business segments, and the following is a\ndiscussion of each segment. See Note 1, Note 2, and Note 12 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information regarding our segments.\nOndas Networks Segment\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet\napplications and services. We refer to these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our\nwireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at\nthe very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to\nprocess large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required in all of the major\ncritical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security\nand government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and\nensure a high degree of safety and security.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”)\nplatform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in\norder to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have targeted the North American\nfreight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy\ncommunications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications.\nThese legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent\ntrain control and management systems. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols,\nand forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by\nour mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates\nto wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports\nthe adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.\nOur software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and\noperated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability\nand data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure\nmarkets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and\nnetwork transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX\nis an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment\nsupporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related\nequipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of\nnetwork capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated\nin our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing\nand data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of\nthese new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.\nPartnership with Siemens and Market Advancements\nOndas Networks and Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”), have a strategic partnership, to both market our\nFullMAX-based networking technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for\nthe North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our\nFullMAX MC-IoT platform.\nWe believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale\nacceptance across the global rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. We have a\njointly-developed product with Siemens — the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems, and Siemens is marketing\nand selling our proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS\nradio systems support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability\nto support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications,\nincluding Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next\ngeneration signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve\nsafety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks’ standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the Siemens\nAirlink brand.\n44\nWe developed a new radio for the Head of Train (HOT) Market in North America and a similar product for the\nIndian rail market. Siemens delivered these 900 MHz rail orders for a major Class I Railroad in the United States and\nreceived HOT orders for the Indian market.\nOndas and Siemens developed a new locomotive radio to support European Railroads. We secured an initial\nvolume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products along\nwith Ondas’ catalog products. We received government authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada and Siemens and\nlaunched our joint effort for the European market at Innotrans in Berlin. Siemens and Ondas demonstrated our over\nthe air compatibility to systems used by passenger rails in the Northeast Corridor of the US.\nIn March 2023 the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) formally announced that IEEE 802.16 standard\nwould be the wireless platform for the greenfield 900 MHz network. In April 2023, the American Railway Engineering\nand Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) voted to require the use of 802.16 in the 900 MHz greenfield band;\nThe AAR also confirmed they have agreed with the Federal Communications Committee to retire the legacy 900 MHz\nband by September 2025 and that the wireless network in the new 900 MHz band would be substantially built by\nApril 2026. In May and June 2023, we responded to RFPs to passenger rail customers in the Northeast Corridor. In\nFebruary 2024, Siemens was selected by Amtrak to deliver their next generation radio based on Ondas’ FullMAX\ntechnology and the 802.16 standard.\nOur relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the\nwider marketing of our wireless technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has\nexpanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products with identified opportunities in North American Transit\nRail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology has broad potential in these large,\nnewly targeted markets.\nOndas Autonomous Systems Segment\nOur Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit develops and integrates drone-based solutions focusing\non high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises. Ondas is marketing\ncomprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its\ncommercially available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous\nand multipurpose aerial data capturing and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor\ndrone designed to neutralize small hostile drones.\nOur unique, fully autonomous platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and\nprotect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense,\nHomeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other governmental entities together with\ncommercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil & Gas, Seaports, Mining, and Heavy Construction.\nFor these industries, Ondas Autonomous Systems provides specialized real-time aerial data capturing and aerial\nprotection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field\narea operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services\nfor successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning,\ncertification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.\nOur portfolio companies, American Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic\ncombination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace business together with data technologies and\nservices for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing all the challenges arising\nalong these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing\nsupport.\nOndas Autonomous Systems and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record of industry-leading\nregulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification (TC) from the FAA for the\nOptimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this\ndistinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for\nbroad flight operations over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design\nwith the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace\nSystem (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations\nfor automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight\n45\n(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that\nOndas Autonomous Systems is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to\nstrategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA includes a 15%\nCorporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“Corporate AMT”) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not\nexpect the Corporate AMT to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the IRA\nimposes a 1% excise tax on net repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations. The excise tax is imposed\non the value of the net stock repurchased or treated as repurchased. The new law will apply to stock repurchases\noccurring after December 31, 2022.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we are required to capitalize R&D expenses for tax purposes and\namortize over five years for domestic based expenses and fifteen years for foreign expenses. Given our tax net operating\nloss carryforward position we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWar in Israel\nOn October 7, 2023, the State of Israel, where Airobotics’ main offices and facilities are located, suffered a\nsurprise attack by hostile forces from the Gaza Strip, which led to the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declaring\na state of war in Israel. This military operation and related activities are on-going as of the date of this filing.\nThe Company has considered various ongoing risks relating to the military operation and related matters,\nincluding:\n• That approximately 17% of the Company’s workforce in Israel was called to active duty, which temporarily\nreduced our workforce;\n• That some of the Company’s Israeli subcontractors, vendors, suppliers and other companies in which\nthe Company relies, are currently only partially active, as instructed by the relevant authorities or\ndue to personnel shortages related to the war effort, which resulted in a temporary delay of inventory\nproduction; and\n• A slowdown in the number of international flights in and out of Israel.\nIn recent weeks, all of the Company’s workforce in Israel returned to work and inventory production restraints\nhave eased. The Company is closely monitoring how the military operation and related activities could adversely affect\nits anticipated milestones and its Israel-based activities to support future operations, including the Company’s ability to\nimport materials that are required to construct the Optimus System™ and to ship them outside of Israel. As of the date\nof this prospectus, the Company has determined that there have not been any materially adverse effects on its business\nor operations, but it continues to monitor the situation, as any future escalation or change could result in a material\nadverse effect on the ability of the Company’s Israeli office to support the Company’s activities. The Company does\nnot have any specific contingency plans in the event of any such escalation or change.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease\n2023 2022 (Decrease)\nRevenue, net\nOndas Networks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 6,722,230 $ 1,931,677 $ 4,790,553\nOndas Autonomous Systems. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,969,200 194,140 8,775,060\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15,691,430 $ 2,125,817 $ 13,565,613\n46\nRevenue increased by $13,565,613 to $15,691,430 for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2,125,817\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.

In 2023,\nwe recognized impairment of $1,500,000 on our long-term equity investment and impairment of approximately\n$2,511,000 on the American Robotics Waltham Lease right-of-use asset and the associated leasehold improvement\nand furniture and fixtures. In 2022, we recognized an impairment of goodwill from the American Robotics acquisition\nof approximately $19,420,000.\nOperating Loss\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Decrease\nOperating loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (39,729,300) $ (69,429,522) $ 29,700,222\n48\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased by $29,700,222, or 43%, to $39,729,300 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared with $69,429,522 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

For\na summary of our outstanding operating leases, see Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the\naccompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe increase in cash flows provided by investing activities of approximately $7,471,000, relates to $1,049,454\ncash acquired with the Airobotics acquisition, combined with a decrease of approximately $723,000 in cash paid for\nasset acquisitions, a decrease of $1,000,000 in cash paid for an investment in Dynam AI, a decrease of $2,000,000\nin cash outflow related to notes receivable, and a decrease of approximately $2,699,000 in cash paid for purchase of\nequipment and patent costs.\n49\nThe decrease in cash provided by financing activities of approximately $15,127,000 was due to a decrease in\nnet proceeds from convertible debt of approximately $18,393,000, exercise of options and warrants of approximately\n$24,000, and the ATM Offering, which raised approximately $6,090,000 in 2022, combined with approximately\n$4,355,000 in cash payments on the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes and approximately $1,147,000 in cash\npayments for Airobotics related debt. This was partially offset by proceeds of approximately $14,692,000 from the\nsale of noncontrolling interest in Ondas Networks and $190,000 in proceeds from government grants in Airobotics.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of\ncapital stock. On December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $198,360,000. On December 31,\n2023, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $5,368,000 net of debt discount and issuance\ncosts of approximately $392,000 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $26,213,000, net of debt\ndiscount and issuance costs of approximately $1,968,000. On December 31, 2023, we had cash and restricted cash of\napproximately $15,022,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $12,334,000.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a convertible debt agreement, which provided cash proceeds of\napproximately $27,702,000. Also in 2022, the Company raised approximately $6,090,000 through the ATM Offering.\nIn 2023, we raised approximately $14,692,000 of net proceeds from the sale redeemable preferences shares in Ondas\nNetworks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately $9,310,000 from a second convertible\ndebt agreement. In February 2024, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $4,500,000 from issuing additional\nredeemable preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately\n$4,100,000 from issuing common stock in Ondas Holdings and warrants in OAH.\nWe expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K from the cash on hand as of December 31, 2023, proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed\nabove, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders,\npotential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or\ndebt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial\ndoubt that the funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated.\nAs a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from\nApril 1, 2024, the date the Consolidated Financial Statements were available to be issued.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing\nand marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing\npatent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing activities and\ncompeting technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in\nour target markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and\nsecure purchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well\nas new customers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders.\nThese activities, including our planned research and development efforts, will require significant uses of working\ncapital. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenue and cash as expected in our current business plan. We\nmay seek additional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of\ncredit or other sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable\nterms or at all, when needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms,\nour ability to fund our operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures\ncould be significantly delayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions,\nor results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n50\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported\namounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers an accounting estimate to be\ncritical if:\n• requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and\n• changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact\non our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, our beliefs of what could\noccur in the future, our observation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information\navailable from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our\nfinancial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments\nin estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation expense, income taxes, complex\nderivative financial instruments and impairment of long-lived assets including intangible assets acquired in business\ncombinations.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense. We calculate share-based compensation expense for option awards\n(“Share-based Award(s)”) based on the estimated grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option\npricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”) and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We\naccount for forfeitures as they occur. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including\nvolatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period of the Share-based\nAward in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards. The expected term is based on the “simplified method.”\nUnder this method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual\nterm of the option award. As the Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has\nidentified several public entities of similar complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility based on the\nvolatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation\nexpense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which are open to\ninterpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact\nthe amount of expense recorded in a given period.\nWe recognize restricted stock unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided.\nCompensation associated with shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees\nis recognized over the expected service period beginning on the measurement date, which is generally the time the\nCompany and the service provider enter into a commitment whereby the Company agrees to grant shares in exchange\nfor the services to be provided.\nIncome Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to\nestimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes is determined\nusing the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. A current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes\npayable for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year\nin which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities\nof changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the\nenactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount\nmore-likely-than-not to be realized. Changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations\nunless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation, in which case both the\ndeferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted. Where a valuation allowance was established\nthrough purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets, any future change will be credited or charged to income\ntax expense. See Note 13 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion\nrelated to Tax Reform.\n51\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and\nthe interpretation and application of complex tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions\nand calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In spite of our belief that we have appropriate\nsupport for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully\nchallenged by the taxing authorities. We determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect\nto uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax laws and\nregulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can involve both a series\nof complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe these estimates\nand assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in\nour provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.\nComplex Derivative Financial Instruments. From time to time, we sell common stock, and we issue convertible\ndebt, both with common stock purchase warrants, which may include terms requiring conversion price or exercise price\nadjustments based on subsequent issuance of securities at prices lower than those in the agreements of such securities.\nIn these situations, the instruments may be accounted for as liabilities and recorded at fair value each reporting\nperiod. Due to the complexity of the agreement, we use an outside expert to assist in providing the mark to market fair\nvaluation of the liabilities over the reporting periods in which the original agreement was in effect. It was determined\nthat a Binomial Lattice option pricing model using a Monte Carlo simulation would provide the most accuracy given\nall the potential variables encompassing a future dilutive event. This model incorporated transaction assumptions such\nas our stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as estimates about future financings, volatility,\nand holder behavior. Although we believe our estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair valuation liabilities\nand related expense were reasonable, these assumptions involved complex judgments about future events, which are\nopen to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly\nimpact the amount of expense recorded in a given period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Carrying values of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets\nare reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not\nbe recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, we determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized\nby testing the applicable asset or asset group’s carrying value for recoverability. This assessment requires the exercise\nof judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the eventual disposal of the assets to\nbe held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity\nand the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If the carrying value of the assets are not\nrecoverable, then a loss is recorded for the difference between the assets’ fair value and respective carrying value. The\nfair value of the assets is determined using an “income approach” based upon a forecast of all the expected discounted\nfuture net cash flows associated with the subject assets. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions\ninclude: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our\nestimates are based upon historical experience, commercial relationships, market conditions and available external\ninformation about future trends.\nRecently Accounting Pronouncements and SEC Rules\nSee Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for recently adopted\naccounting pronouncements and SEC rules and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the\ndate of this report.\nItem 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring\nlosses from operations, negative cash flows from operations and a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2023.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, management conducts a goodwill\nimpairment assessment annually at December 31, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use\nF-2\nof the income approach using estimates of future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units. As a result\nof the annual impairment assessment, the Company recognized no impairment of goodwill related to the Autonomous\nSystems reporting unit.\nWe identified the impairment of goodwill as a critical audit matter because of significant judgments required\nby management to estimate the fair value of its Autonomous Systems reporting unit, including forecasted cash flows,\nrevenue growth rates and other significant assumptions developed by the Company. This required a high degree of\nauditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness\nof management’s analysis.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the goodwill impairment included the following:\n– We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of the controls over the assessment of goodwill\nimpairment, including those over the determination of fair value of the reporting unit.\n– Tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and evaluated significant assumptions and the\nunderlying data used by the Company by performing procedures to test the projected financial information,\nby comparing them with the historical forecasted results of the respective reporting unit and assessing the\nimpacts of internal and/or external economic factors. We also evaluated this information by comparing the\nprojections to information included in analyst reports, as well as industry outlook information, and events\noccurring subsequent to December 31, 2023.\n– We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation\nof the methodology applied in the model and discount rates used in the valuations.\n/s/ Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman, P.A.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\nSomerset, New Jersey\nApril 1, 2024\nF-3\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 14,979,436 $ 29,775,096\nRestricted cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42,564 —\nAccounts receivable, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,429,974 104,276\nInventory, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,186,646 2,173,017\nNote receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 2,000,000\nOther current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,967,619 1,749,613\nTotal current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23,606,239 35,802,002\nProperty and equipment, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,175,958 3,023,285\nOther Assets:\nGoodwill, net of accumulated impairment charges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,751,921 25,606,983\nIntangible assets, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31,329,182 28,863,773\nLong-term equity investment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 1,500,000\nLease deposits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 599,517 218,206\nOperating lease right of use assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,701,865 2,930,996\nTotal other assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 64,382,485 59,119,958\nTotal assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 92,164,682 $ 97,945,245\nLIABILITIES, TEMPORARY EQUITY, AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 5,177,022 $ 2,965,829\nOperating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 685,099 580,593\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,587,877 3,268,993\nConvertible note payable, net of debt discount and issuance cost of\n$1,968,411 and $2,303,664, respectively . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25,692,505 15,849,445\nDeferred revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 276,944 61,508\nGovernment grant liability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 520,657 —\nTotal current liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35,940,104 22,726,368\nLong-Term Liabilities:\nNotes payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 300,000 300,000\nConvertible notes payable, net of current, net of unamortized issuance cost\nof $391,718 and $948,201, respectively . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,812,156 14,198,690\nAccrued interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26,844 40,965\nGovernment grant liability net of current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,229,047 —\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,800,710 2,456,315\nTotal long-term liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,168,757 16,995,970\nTotal liabilities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47,108,861 39,722,338\nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 14)\nTemporary Equity\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,920,694 —\nF-4\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS — (Continued)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred stock – par value $0.0001;

(“Ondas Holdings”, “Ondas”, the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) was originally incorporated\nin Nevada on December 22, 2014, under the name of Zev Ventures Incorporated. On September 28, 2018, we acquired\nOndas Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ondas Networks”), and changed our name to Ondas Holdings Inc.\nOn August 5, 2021, we acquired American Robotics, Inc. (“American Robotics” or “AR”), a Delaware corporation.\nOn January 23, 2023, we acquired Airobotics, Ltd. (“Airobotics”), an Israeli-based developer of autonomous drone\nsystems. See Note 5 — Goodwill and Business Acquisition. On December 6, 2023, the Company formed Ondas\nAutonomous Holdings Inc. (“OAH”), a Nevada corporation, as an intermediate holding company which now\nwholly-owns American Robotics and Airobotics.\nAs a result, Ondas Networks, OAH, American Robotics and Airobotics became our subsidiaries. These\nsubsidiaries are now Ondas’ primary focus. Ondas’ corporate headquarters are located in Marlborough, Massachusetts.\nOndas Networks has offices and facilities in Sunnyvale, California, American Robotics’ offices and facilities are\nlocated in Sparks, Maryland and Marlborough, Massachusetts, and Airobotics’ offices and facilities are located in\nPetah Tikva, Israel.\nBusiness Activity\nOndas is a leading provider of private wireless, drone, and automated data solutions through its subsidiaries\nOndas Networks, OAH, Airobotics, and American Robotics. Airobotics is an Israeli-based developer of autonomous\ndrone systems. American Robotics is a leading developer of highly automated commercial drone systems. Airobotics\nand American Robotics operate together under OAH as a separate business unit called Ondas Autonomous Systems.\nOndas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and\ncritical infrastructure and government markets with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data\ncollection and information processing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as\nseparate business segments, and the following is a discussion of each segment.\nOn February 14, 2023, the Company announced the formation of Ondas Autonomous Systems, a new business\nunit to manage the combined drone operations of subsidiaries American Robotics and Airobotics. Ondas Networks\nand Ondas Autonomous Systems together provide users in rail, energy, mining, public safety and critical infrastructure\nand government markets with improved connectivity, data collection capabilities, and data collection and information\nprocessing capabilities. We operate Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as separate business segments.\nOndas Networks\nOndas Networks provides wireless connectivity solutions enabling mission-critical Industrial Internet\napplications and services. We refer to these applications as the Mission-Critical Internet of Things (“MC-IoT”). Our\nwireless networking products are applicable to a wide range of MC-IoT applications, which are most often located at\nthe very edge of large industrial networks. These applications require secure, real-time connectivity with the ability to\nprocess large amounts of data at the edge of large industrial networks. Such applications are required in all of the major\ncritical infrastructure markets, including rail, electric grids, drones, oil and gas, and public safety, homeland security\nand government, where secure, reliable and fast operational decisions are required in order to improve efficiency and\nensure a high degree of safety and security.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”)\nplatform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in\norder to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. We have targeted the North American\nfreight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy\ncommunications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications.\nThese legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent\ntrain control and management systems. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of\nF-10\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols,\nand forms the core of the IEEE 802.16 standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by\nour mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we continue to take a leadership position in IEEE as it relates\nto wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports\nthe adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.\nOur software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and\noperated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability\nand data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure\nmarkets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and\nnetwork transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX\nis an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment\nsupporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related\nequipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of\nnetwork capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated\nin our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing\nand data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of\nthese new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.\nOndas Autonomous Systems\nOur Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit develops and integrates drone-based solutions focusing\non high-performance critical applications for government and Tier-1 commercial enterprises. Ondas is marketing\ncomprehensive drone-based solutions to address the needs of governmental and commercial customers based on its\ncommercially available platforms: the Optimus System™, a fully autonomous drone platform capable of continuous\nand multipurpose aerial data capturing and analytics, and the Iron Drone Raider™, a fully autonomous interceptor\ndrone designed to neutralize small hostile drones. Airobotics acquired the assets of Iron Drone on March 6, 2023.\nOur unique, fully autonomous platforms enable cutting-edge aerial capabilities and are designed to serve and\nprotect critical infrastructure and operations. Our business focuses on end-user entities in Public Safety, Defense,\nHomeland Security, Smart City, Port Authorities, State Departments, and other governmental entities together with\ncommercial customers of industrial sensitive facilities such as Oil & Gas, Seaports, Mining, and Heavy Construction.\nFor these industries, Ondas Autonomous Systems provides specialized real-time aerial data capturing and aerial\nprotection solutions in the most complex environments such as urban areas, sensitive and critical facilities and field\narea operations, and high-priority projects. In addition, we offer a wide suite of supplementary, enabling services\nfor successful implementation such as AI data analytics, data automation, IT implementation, safety planning,\ncertification, training, and maintenance, handling all the complex aspects of such high-performance drone operations.\nOur portfolio companies, American Robotics and Airobotics, form a unique, powerful, and synergistic\ncombination covering all the aspects required for successful Aerospace business together with data technologies and\nservices for digital transformation industries. Our companies are specialized in addressing all the challenges arising\nalong these types of product lifecycles including research and development, manufacturing, certification, and ongoing\nsupport.\nOndas Autonomous Systems and its portfolio companies have already gained a track record of industry-leading\nregulatory successes including the securing of the first-of-its-kind Type Certification (TC) from the FAA for the\nOptimus 1-EX UAV on September 25, 2023, becoming the first autonomous security data capture UAV to achieve this\ndistinction. TC, recognized as the highest echelon of Airworthiness Certification, streamline operational approvals for\nbroad flight operations over people and infrastructure. The certification verifies the compliance of the system’s design\nwith the required FAA airworthiness and noise standards, ensuring safe operation within the US National Airspace\nSystem (NAS) thereby significantly broadening the range of operational scenarios and scaling up of operations\nfor automated UAS. Achieving FAA Type Certification will enable drone operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight\nF-11\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)\n(BVLOS) without a human operator on-site. With a strong footprint in the US market and worldwide, we believe that\nOndas Autonomous Systems is well-positioned with proven technology, a unique offering, and strong capabilities to\nstrategically transform critical operations with our cutting-edge drone tech and capabilities.\nLiquidity\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have funded our operations primarily through debt and the sale of\ncapital stock. On December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $198,360,000. On December 31,\n2023, we had net long-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $5,368,000 net of debt discount and issuance\ncosts of approximately $392,000 and short-term borrowings outstanding of approximately $26,213,000, net of debt\ndiscount and issuance costs of approximately $1,968,000. On December 31, 2023, we had cash and restricted cash of\napproximately $15,022,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $12,334,000.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a convertible debt agreement, which provided cash proceeds of\napproximately $27,702,000. Also in 2022, the Company raised approximately $6,090,000 through the ATM Offering.\nIn 2023, we raised approximately $14,692,000 of net proceeds from the sale redeemable preferences shares in Ondas\nNetworks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately $9,310,000 from a second convertible\ndebt agreement. In February 2024, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $4,500,000 from issuing additional\nredeemable preference shares in Ondas Networks and warrants in Ondas Holdings to third parties, and approximately\n$4,100,000 from issuing common stock in Ondas Holdings and warrants in OAH.\nWe expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K from the cash on hand as of December 31, 2023, proceeds from the 2024 financing activities discussed\nabove, gross profits generated from revenue growth, potential prepayments from customers for purchase orders,\npotential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds that we may seek through equity or\ndebt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources. There is substantial\ndoubt that the funding plans will be successful and therefore the conditions discussed above have not been alleviated.\nAs a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from\nApril 1, 2024, the date the Consolidated Financial Statements were available to be issued.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including progress with developing, manufacturing\nand marketing our technologies, the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing\npatent claims and other proprietary rights, our ability to establish collaborative arrangements, marketing activities and\ncompeting technological and market developments, including regulatory changes and overall economic conditions in our\ntarget markets. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability requires us to successfully market and secure\npurchase orders for our products and services from customers currently identified in our sales pipeline as well as new\ncustomers. We also will be required to efficiently manufacture and deliver equipment on those purchase orders. These\nactivities, including our planned research and development efforts, will require significant uses of working capital. There\ncan be no assurance that we will generate revenue and cash as expected in our current business plan. We may seek\nadditional funds through equity or debt offerings and/or borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or\nother sources. We do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all,\nwhen needed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to fund\nour operations, support the growth of our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly\ndelayed or limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA includes a\n15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“Corporate AMT”) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We\ndo not expect the Corporate AMT to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally,\nthe IRA imposes a 1% excise tax on net repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations. The excise\ntax is imposed on the value of the net stock repurchased or treated as repurchased. The new law will apply to stock\nrepurchases occurring after December 31, 2022.\nF-12\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont.)\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we are required to capitalize R&D expenses for tax purposes and\namortize over five years for domestic based expenses and fifteen years for foreign expenses. Given our tax net operating\nloss carryforward position we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries, Ondas\nNetworks, American Robotics, and Airobotics. All inter-company accounts and transactions between these entities\nhave been eliminated in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The functional currency of the Company and all of\nour subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe utilize the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other\nthings, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in Ondas’ results of operations beginning on\nthe respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of\nthe acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on\nthe acquisition date; these are recorded in either other accruals within current liabilities (for expected payments in less\nthan a year) or other non-current liabilities (for expected payments in greater than a year), both on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other\nincome (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Contingent consideration payments made soon after\nthe acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent\nconsideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition date fair value\nare reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the\noriginal acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in certain cases, may be subject to revision based on the final\ndetermination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due\ndiligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the underlying net assets of an\nacquired business. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of its\nfiscal year, or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist. The Company evaluates qualitative\nfactors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and\nwhether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment process. The impairment of Goodwill was $0 and $19,419,600\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, see Note 5 — Goodwill and Business Acquisition, for\nfurther details.\nIntangible assets represent patents, licenses, software and allocation of purchase price to identifiable intangible\nassets of an acquired business. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the fair market\nvalue measurement requirement. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.\nWe amortize our intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis, over 3 years for software; 10 years\nfor patents; 3 – 10 years for developed technology, 10 years for licenses, trademarks, marketing-related assets and the\nFAA waiver; 5 years for customer relationships; and 1 year for non-compete agreements.\nF-13\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available\nand is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in making decisions regarding resource\nallocation and performance assessment. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company\ndetermined it has two reportable segments: Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems as the CODM reviews\nfinancial information for these two businesses separately. The Company has no inter-segment sales.\nUse of Estimates\nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. Such management estimates include those relating to allocation of\nconsideration for business combinations to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, revenue recognition, inventory\nwrite-downs to reflect net realizable value, fair values of financial instruments and goodwill, assumptions used in the\nvaluation of stock-based awards and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or\nless to be cash equivalents. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no cash equivalents. The Company periodically\nmonitors its positions with, and the credit quality of the financial institutions with which it invests. Periodically,\nthroughout the year, and as of December 31, 2023, the Company has maintained balances in excess of federally insured\nlimits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was approximately $13,972,000 in excess of federally insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for credit losses as well as net\nof any discounts or other forms of variable consideration. We estimate allowance for credit losses by evaluating\nspecific accounts where information indicates our customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such\nas customer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond\ncontractual terms. We use assumptions and judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record an\nallowance to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These allowances are evaluated and adjusted\nas additional information is received. We had no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInventory\nInventories, which consist solely of raw materials, work in process and finished goods, are stated at the lower\nof cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value, net of reserves for obsolete inventory. We continually analyze our\nslow-moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices,\nwe established reserves. Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level\nthat approximates its estimate of future demand. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net\nrealizable value. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, such reserves were $100,254.\nF-14\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nInventory consists of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw Material . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,499,727 $ 2,041,776\nWork in Process. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 782,770 89,080\nFinished Goods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,403 142,415\nLess Inventory Reserves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Maintenance and repairs are\ncharged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is principally recorded using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives typically are (i) 3 to 7 years for computer\nequipment, (ii) 5 years for vehicles and docking stations and drones, (iii) 7 – 17 years for furniture and fixtures,\n(iv) 5 to 7 years for development equipment, and (v) 3 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements\nare amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon\nthe disposal of property, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the amounts recorded\ntherein for such items, and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in operating expenses in the year of disposition.\nSoftware\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a software product are charged to expense until\ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software\ncosts are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining\nwhen technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our\nsoftware products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.\nGenerally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is\nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Company had no internally developed software.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nmay not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Such indicators include significant technological changes,\nadverse changes in market conditions and/or poor operating results. The carrying value of a long-lived asset group is\nconsidered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying value. The amount\nof impairment loss recognized is the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset\nor asset group. Fair market value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate\ncommensurate with the risk involved. The impairment of long-lived assets was $2,523,528 and $12,343 for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For additional information on the asset impairment charges, see\nNote — 2 Summary of Significant Account Policies, Leases, and Note 4 — Property and Equipment.\nResearch and Development\nCosts for research and development are expensed as incurred except for research and development equipment\nwith alternative future use. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, salary related expenses\nand costs of contractors and materials.\nF-15\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist primarily of receivables,\naccounts payable, accrued expenses and short- and long-term debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts\npayable and accrued expenses approximate our fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. Our\nfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include right of use assets, goodwill and intangibles,\nwhich are adjusted to fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may\nnot be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Our estimate of the fair value of right of use assets, goodwill and\nintangibles are based on expected future cash flows and actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe have categorized our assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level\nfair value hierarchy in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy gives\nthe highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nAssets and liabilities recorded in the balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs,\nas follows:\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full\nterm of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe Company had no assets or liabilities that were required to be valued at fair value as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company had Level 3 assets that are required to be valued at fair value as of December 31, 2023, see Note — 2\nSummary of Significant Account Policies, Leases, and Note 4 — Property and Equipment.\nThe Company also had Level 3 liabilities that are required to be valued at fair value as of December 31, 2023.\nThe fair value of the government grant liability is determined as the sum of 3% royalty payments on forecasted future\nsales, discounted using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2023, the Company made the following\nassumptions: (i) royalty payments will be made on future sales through 2026, and (ii) the effective interest rate is a\nrange of 17-19%.

After\nconsummation of equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of additional paid-in\ncapital generated as a result of the offering. Should the planned equity financing be abandoned, the deferred offering\ncosts are expensed immediately as a charge to other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a reduction in proceeds received of $0 and\n$35,841, respectively, related to the ATM Offering. See Note 10 — Stockholders’ Equity.\nOn July 11, 2023, the Company and the Sales Agent (as defined below), mutually agreed to terminate the\nATM Agreement (as defined below), and the Company expensed the remaining deferred offering costs of $145,293\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company expensed offering\ncosts of $45,823. The deferred offering costs outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $0 and $145,293,\nrespectively.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Government liability was assumed through the acquisition of Airobotics and asset purchase of Iron Drone.\nAirobotics and Iron Drone received government grants from the Israel Innovation Authority (formerly: the Office of\nthe Chief Scientist in Israel, “the IIA”), and the grant funds are repayable to the extent that future economic benefits\nare expected from the research project that will result in royalty-bearing sales. A liability for grants received is first\nmeasured at fair value using a discount rate that reflects a market rate of interest. The difference between the amount\nof the grant received and the fair value of the liability is accounted for as a government grant and recognized as a\nreduction of research and development expenses.\nAt each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether there is reasonable assurance that the liability recognized,\nin whole or in part, will not be repaid (since the Company will not be required to pay royalties) based on the best\nestimate of future sales and using the original effective interest method, which is 17 – 19%, and if so, the appropriate\namount of the liability is derecognized through other income (expense). Amounts paid as royalties are treated as a\nreduction of the liability. Royalty payments are due every nine months. There is no maturity date. The liability exists\nuntil it is paid in full through royalty payments or the Company reports to the IIA there will be no further sales, and\nthey accept this.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOn July 9, 2023, Ondas Networks Inc. entered into an Agreement with a third party for the sale of redeemable\npreferred stock in Ondas Networks. The preferred stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (8%)\nof the original issue price and can be redeemed at the request of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary for\nthe greater of two times the initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Preferred\nStock was converted into Common Stock (see Note 11 — Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest). The applicable\naccounting guidance requires an equity instrument that is redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside\nof permanent equity if it is redeemable (a) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (b) at the\noption of the holder, or (c) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. As a result,\nthe Company recorded the noncontrolling interest as redeemable noncontrolling interest and classified it in temporary\nequity within its consolidated balance sheet initially at its acquisition-date estimated redemption value or fair value. In\naddition, the Company has elected to accrete the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the full redemption value as of\nthe earliest redemption date by accruing dividends at 8% per annum and accreting the redemption value to two times\nthe initial investment over five years using the effective interest rate method.\nF-17\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\nare measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax\nrates is recognized when the rate change is enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets\nto the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize the effect of\nuncertain income tax positions only if the positions are more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on\nthe technical merits of the position. Recognized uncertain income tax positions are measured at the largest amount\nthat is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in\nwhich those changes in judgment occur. We recognize both interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as\npart of the income tax provision.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe calculate share-based compensation expense for option awards (“Share-based Award(s)”) based on the\nestimated grant/issue date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”)\nand recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the\nweighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards.\nThe expected term is based on the “simplified method”, due to the Company’s limited option exercise history. Under\nthis method, the term is estimated using the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term\nof the option award. As the Company does not yet have sufficient history of its own volatility, the Company has\nidentified several public entities of similar size, complexities and industry and calculates historical volatility based on\nthe volatilities of these companies. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation\nexpense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which are open to\ninterpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact\nthe amount of expense recorded in a given period.\nWe recognize restricted stock unit expense over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided.\nCompensation associated with shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Common Stock”),\nissued or to be issued to consultants and other non-employees is recognized over the expected service period beginning\non the measurement date, which is generally the time the Company and the service provider enter into a commitment\nwhereby the Company agrees to grant shares in exchange for the services to be provided.\nShipping and Handling\nWe expense all shipping and handling costs as incurred. These costs are included in Cost of goods sold on the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. We recognized expense of $182,070 and $80,934 for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These costs are included in Sales and marketing on the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nF-18\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nPost-Retirement Benefits\nWe have one 401(k) Savings Plan for US employees that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under\nSection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this 401(k) Plan, matching contributions are based upon the\namount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized expense of $328,357 and\n$351,837 for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nAirobotics’ post-employment benefits are usually funded by deposits with insurance companies and are\nclassified as defined deposit plans or defined benefit plans. Airobotics’ has defined deposit plans, in accordance with\nSection 14 of Severance Compensation Israeli Law, 1963, according to which Airobotics regularly makes its payments\nwithout having a legal or implied obligation to make additional payments even if the fund has not accumulated\nsufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits, in the current period and in previous periods. Deposits to a defined\nbenefit plan for severance pay or benefits, are recognized as an expense when deposited with the plan in parallel\nwith receiving work services from the employee. All of Airobotics’ employees in Israel are subject to Section 14 of\nSeverance Compensation Israeli Law. We recognized expense of $624,758 for the period of January 24, 2023 through\nDecember 31, 2023 related to these post-employment benefits.\nRevenue Recognition\nOndas has two business segments that generate revenue: Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems.\nOndas Networks generates revenue from product sales, services, and development projects. Ondas Autonomous\nSystems, which includes American Robotics and Airobotics, generates revenue from product sales, services, and data\nsubscription services.\nOndas Networks is engaged in the development, marketing, and sale of wireless radio systems for secure, wide\narea mission-critical, business-to-business networks. Ondas Networks generates revenue primarily from the sale of our\nFullMAX System and the delivery of related services, along with non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) development\nprojects with certain customers.\nOndas Autonomous Systems generates revenue through the sales of their Optimus system and separately priced\nsupport, maintenance and ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Optimus system. Ondas Autonomous\nSystems also generates service revenue by selling a data subscription service to its customers based on the information\ncollected by their autonomous systems.\nRevenue for development projects is typically recognized over time using a percentage of completion input\nmethod, whereby revenues are recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of satisfaction of the performance\nobligation based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. The input method is utilized because\nmanagement considers it to be the best available measure of progress as the performance obligations are completed.\nRevenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from\nchanges in estimates of revenue and cost of revenue are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes\nin the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods base in the performance\ncompleted to date.\nSubscription revenue is recognized on straight line basis over the length of the customer subscription agreement.\nIf a subscription payment is received prior to installation and operation of their autonomous systems, it is held in\ndeferred revenue and recognized after operation commences over the length of the subscription service.\nCollaboration Arrangements Within the Scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements\nThe Company’s development revenue includes contracts where the Company and the customer work\ncooperatively to develop software and hardware applications. The Company analyzes these contracts to assess whether\nsuch arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the\nactivities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and are\nF-19\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\ntherefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”). This assessment is performed\nthroughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For\ncollaboration arrangements that are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808, the Company first determines which\nelements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a\nvendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n(“ASC 606”). The Company’s policy is generally to recognize amounts received from collaborators in connection with\njoint operating activities that are within the scope of ASC 808 as a reduction in research and development expense.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not identified any contracts with its customers that meet the\ncriteria of ASC 808.\nArrangements Within the Scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nUnder ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of promised products or\nservices, in an amount that reflects the consideration which is expected to be received in exchange for those products\nor services. The Company recognizes revenue following the five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify\ncontract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction\nprice; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue\nwhen (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to\ncontracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the products\nor services it transfers to the customer.\nAt contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses\nthe products or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and\nassesses whether each promised product or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount\nof the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance\nobligation is satisfied. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of\nvariable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the expected value method. Variable\nconsideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal\nof cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of\nwhether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated\nperformance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. Sales and other taxes\ncollected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, none\nof our contracts with customers included variable consideration\nContracts that are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements are assessed to\ndetermine if the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Generally,\ncontract modifications are for products or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the inability\nto use, consume or sell the products or services on their own to generate economic benefits and are accounted for as\nif they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and measure\nof progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an\nincrease in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, there were no modifications to contract specifications.\nProduct revenue is comprised of sales of the Ondas Networks’ software defined base station and remote radios,\nits network management and monitoring system, and accessories. Ondas Networks’ software and hardware is sold\nwith a limited one-year basic warranty included in the price. The limited one-year basic warranty is an assurance-type\nwarranty, is not a separate performance obligation, and thus no transaction price is allocated to it. The nature of tasks\nunder the limited one-year basic warranty only provides for remedying defective product(s) covered by the warranty.\nProduct revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point\nin time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract, or upon\ninstallation when the combined performance obligation is not distinct within the context of the contract.\nF-20\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nService revenue is comprised of separately priced extended warranty sales, network support and maintenance,\nremote monitoring, as well as ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Ondas Networks’ wireless\ncommunications products including wireless network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software\nconfiguration, product training, installation, and onsite support. The extended warranty Ondas Networks sells provides\na level of assurance beyond the coverage for defects that existed at the time of a sale or against certain types of\ncovered damage. The extended warranty includes 1) factory hardware repair or replacement of the base station and\nremote radios, at our election, 2) software upgrades, bug fixes and new features of the radio software and network\nmanagement systems (“NMS”), 3) deployment and network architecture support, and 4) technical support by phone\nand email. Ancillary service revenues are recognized at the point in time when those services have been provided to\nthe customer and the performance obligation has been satisfied. The Company allocates the transaction price to the\nservice and extended warranty based on the stand-alone selling prices of these performance obligations, which are\nstated in our contracts. Revenue for the extended warranty is recognized over time.\nDevelopment revenue is comprised primarily of non-recurring engineering service contracts to develop software\nand hardware applications for various customers. For Ondas Networks, in 2023, a significant portion of this revenue\nis generated from one parent customer whereby Ondas Networks is to develop such applications to interoperate within\nthe customers infrastructure. For these contracts, Ondas Networks and the customers work cooperatively, whereby\nthe customers’ involvement is to provide technical specifications for the product design, as well as, to review and\napprove the project progress at various markers based on predetermined milestones. The products developed are not\nable to be sold to any other customer and are based in part upon existing Ondas Networks and customer technology.\nDevelopment revenue is either recognized at the point in time when those services have been provided to the customer\nand the performance obligation has been satisfied recognized, or as services are provided over the life of the contract\nas Ondas Networks has an enforceable right to payment for services completed to date and there is no alternative use\nof the product, depending on the contract.\nIf the customer contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to\nthe single performance obligation. We enter into certain contracts within our service revenues that have multiple\nperformance obligations, one or more of which may be delivered subsequent to the delivery of other performance\nobligations. We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised\nproducts or services underlying each performance obligation. We determine standalone selling prices based on the\nprice at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through\npast transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price considering available information such as market conditions\nand internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Revenue is then allocated to the\nperformance obligations using the relative selling prices of each of the performance obligations in the contract.\nOndas Networks’ payment terms vary and range from Net 15 to Net 30 days from the date of the invoices for\nproduct and services related revenue. Ondas Networks’ payment terms for the majority of their development related\nrevenue carry milestone-related payment obligations which span the contract life. For milestone-based contracts, the\ncustomer reviews the completed milestone and once approved, makes payment pursuant to the applicable contract.\nOndas Autonomous Systems’ product revenue is comprised of sales of the Optimus system which includes a\ndrone, docking station, different flown sensors (payloads), communications system, batteries, and others. The Optimus\nsystem is sold with a limited one-year basic warranty included in the price. The limited one-year basic warranty is an\nassurance-type warranty, is not a separate performance obligation, and thus no transaction price is allocated to it. The\nnature of tasks under the limited one-year basic warranty only provides for remedying defective product(s) covered by\nthe warranty. Product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs\nat a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract,\nor upon installation when the combined performance obligation is not distinct within the context of the contract.\nOndas Autonomous Systems’ service revenue is comprised of separately priced support and maintenance sales,\nas well as ancillary services directly related to the sale of the Optimus system including product training, installation,\nand onsite support. Ondas Autonomous Systems also generates service revenue by selling a data subscription service\nto its customers based on the information collected by their autonomous systems. The customer pays for a monthly,\nF-21\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nannual, or multi-annual subscription service to remotely access the data collected by their autonomous systems.\nAncillary service revenues are recognized at the point in time when those services have been provided to the customer\nand the performance obligation has been satisfied. The Company allocates the transaction price to the service based\non the stand-alone selling prices of these performance obligations, which are stated in our contracts.\nOndas Autonomous Systems’ payment terms vary and range from Net 30 days to Net 60 days from the date of\nthe invoices for product and services related revenue. Ondas Autonomous Systems’ payment terms for the majority\nof their development related revenue carry milestone-related payment obligations which span the contract life. For\nmilestone-based contracts, the customer reviews the completed milestone and once approved, makes payment pursuant\nto the applicable contract.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables present our disaggregated revenues by Type of Revenue and Timing of Revenue.\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nType of Revenue\nProduct revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 12,102,388 $ 872,660\nService and subscription revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,126,560 319,140\nDevelopment revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,462,482 934,017\nTotal revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15,691,430 $ 2,125,817\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nTiming of Revenue\nRevenue recognized point in time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 14,071,906 $ 872,660\nRevenue recognized over time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,619,524 1,253,157\nTotal revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15,691,430 $ 2,125,817\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCountry of Revenue, based on location services were provided or product was\nshipped to:\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 5,717,832 $ 2,125,817\nUnited Arab Emirates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,521,393 —\nUnited Kingdom . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 995,357 —\nIsrael . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 429,107 —\nIndia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27,741 —\nTotal revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15,691,430 $ 2,125,817\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe recognize a receivable or contract asset when we perform a service or transfer a good in advance of receiving\nconsideration.

The assurance-type warranty covers defects in material and\nworkmanship only. If a software or hardware component is determined to be defective after being tested by the\nCompany within the one-year, the Company will repair, replace or refund the price of the covered hardware and/or\nsoftware to the customer (not including any shipping, handling, delivery or installation charges). We estimate, based\nupon a review of historical warranty claim experience, the costs that may be incurred under our warranties and record\na liability in the amount of such estimate at the time a product is sold. Factors that affect our warranty liability include\nthe number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically\nassess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the accrual as claims data and historical experience\nwarrants. The Company has assessed the costs of fulfilling its existing assurance-type warranties and has determined\nthat the estimated outstanding warranty obligation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are immaterial to the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nLeases\nUnder Topic 842, operating lease expense is generally recognized evenly over the term of the lease. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s operating leases consisted of office spaces in Sunnyvale, CA,\nMarlborough, MA (the “American Robotics Lease”), Waltham, MA (the “Waltham Lease”), and Petah Tikva, Israel\n(the “Airobotics Leases”).\nF-23\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a 24-month lease (effective April 1, 2021) with the owner and landlord (the\n“2021 Gibraltar Lease”), wherein the base rate is $45,000 per month, with a security deposit in the amount of $90,000.\nOn April 1, 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Gibraltar Lease to extend the lease through September 30, 2023,\nwherein the base rate is $65,676 per month. On November 6, 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Gibraltar Lease,\nas amended to further extend the lease through June 30, 2024, wherein the base rate is $68,959 per month.\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company acquired American Robotics and the American Robotics Lease, located in\nMarlborough, Massachusetts, wherein the base rate is $15,469 per month, with an annual increase of 3% through\nJanuary 2024, with a security deposit of $24,166. On August 19, 2021, American Robotics amended the American\nRobotics Lease to reduce their space to approximately 10,450 square feet. The amendment reduced their annual base\nrent to $8,802 per month, with an annual increase of 3% through January 31, 2024. On November 10, 2023, American\nRobotics amended the American Robotics Lease, as amended to extend the existing lease term from January 31, 2024\nto January 31, 2026 and to relinquish a portion of the leased outdoor space. The annual base rent is $14,586 per month\nstarting February 1, 2024, with an annual increase of 3.5% through January 2026. These facilities also serve as Ondas’\ncorporate headquarters.\nOn October 8, 2021, American Robotics entered into an 86-month operating lease for space in Waltham,\nMassachusetts. The Waltham Lease commenced on March 1, 2022, and is scheduled to terminate on April 30, 2029,\nwherein the base rate is $39,375 per month, increasing 3% annually, with a security deposit due in the amount of\n$104,040.\nOn January 23, 2023, the Company acquired Airobotics and the Airobotics Leases, which includes office space\nin Petah Tikva, Israel leased according to three different lease agreements. Each agreement is with respect to different\nsections of the entire leased area and are in effect through December 31, 2023, February 28, 2024, and November 30,\n2024 wherein the base rate of the entire leased area is approximately $20,500 per month.\nOn August 7, 2023, Ondas Networks entered into a 72-month lease agreement with the owner and landlord of\noffice space in Sunnyvale, CA (the “Oakmead Lease”). The Oakmead Lease commenced on October 1, 2023, and is an\noperating lease through September 30, 2029. Base rent is $77,533 per month, increasing approximately 3% annually,\nwith a security deposit due in the amount of $269,428. Base rent shall be abated during the first twelve months of the\nterm of the lease.\nOn January 15, 2024, American Robotics entered into an agreement to sublet their full leased space,\nleasehold improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in Waltham, Massachusetts through April 30, 2029,\nthe remaining lease term, for $22,920 per month from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025, then $41,250 per\nmonth from May 1, 2025 through April 30, 2029. The sublease is an operating lease. This event indicated that\nthe carrying amount of the right of use asset, leasehold improvements, and remaining furniture and fixtures in\nWaltham, Massachusetts (the “Asset Group”) may not be recoverable. The Asset Group was tested for recoverability\nusing the undiscounted cash flows from the sublease and the Company found the Asset Group to be impaired. The\nCompany determined the Level 3 fair value of the Asset Group using the sum of future cash flows from the sublease,\ndiscounted to the present value using an assumed discount rate of 10.5%. Based on this valuation, the Company\nrecorded an impairment charge of $1,383,536 related to the right of use asset associated with this Asset Group,\nwhich is included in General and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. If we\ndetermine the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, we then determine whether the lease is\nan operating lease or finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in recording a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and\nlease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the\nlease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease\nROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments\nF-24\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nover the lease term. For purposes of calculating operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, we use the\nnon-cancellable lease term plus options to extend that we are reasonably certain to take. Lease expense for operating\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our leases generally do not provide an\nimplicit rate. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. This rate is generally consistent with the interest rate we pay\non borrowings under our credit facilities, as this rate approximates our collateralized borrowing capabilities over a\nsimilar term of the lease payments. We have elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from\nshort-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying assets. We have elected not to separate lease and\nnon-lease components for any class of underlying asset.\nLease Costs\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nComponents of total lease costs:\nOperating lease expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,231,198 $ 1,151,453\nCommon area maintenance expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 277,865 103,691\nShort-term lease costs(1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 813,797 48,870\nTotal lease costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2,322,860 $ 1,304,014\n(1) Represents short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, which are immaterial.\nLease Positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nROU lease assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet\nas follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets:\nOperating lease assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 4,701,865 $ 2,930,996\nTotal lease assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 4,701,865 $ 2,930,996\nLiabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities, current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 685,099 $ 580,593\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,800,710 2,456,315\nTotal lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 6,485,809 $ 3,036,908\nOther Leases Information\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating cash flows for operating leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,038,556 $ 878,627\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) – operating lease . . . . . . . . . . 4.73 5.86\nWeighted average discount rate – operating lease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9.99% 5.78%\nF-25\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nUndiscounted Leases Cash Flows\nFuture lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet on\nDecember 31, 2023, as follows:\nYears ending December 31,\n2024. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 815,880\n2025. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,802,201\n2026. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,653,139\n2027. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,568,688\n2028. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,616,022\nThereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 999,204\nTotal future minimum lease payments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 8,455,134\nLease imputed interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Income\navailable to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting the dividends accumulated for the period on\ncumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from net income.\nThe computation of diluted net loss per share is similar to the computation of basic net loss per share except that\nthe numerator may have to adjust for any dividends and income or loss associated with potentially dilutive securities\nthat are assumed to have resulted in the issuance of shares of common stock, and the denominator may have to adjust\nto include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential\nshares of common stock had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from shares\nof common stock issuable through stock options, warrants, restricted stock units, or convertible preferred stock. For\npurposes of determining diluted earnings per common share, the treasury stock method is used for stock options,\nwarrants, and restricted stock units, and the if-converted method is used for convertible preferred stock as prescribed\nin ASC Topic 260. Because of the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the impact of including\nthis in our computation of diluted net loss per share was anti-dilutive.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted net loss per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nWarrants to purchase common stock . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,566,092 1,901,802\nOptions to purchase common stock . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,854,507 2,412,286\nPotential shares issuable under 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes . . . . . . . . . . . 62,084,776 24,177,835\nPotential shares issuable under 2023 Additional Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29,125,732 —\nRestricted stock units . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 554,466 1,111,617\nTotal potentially dilutive securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 109,185,573 29,603,540\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts\nreceivable.

We generally\ndo not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our\ncustomers and maintain an allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Customers\nBecause we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number\nof customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue. Revenue from significant customers, those\nrepresenting 10% or more of total revenue, was composed of three customers accounting for 42%, 33% and 22% of\nthe Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. One customer accounted for 89% of the\nCompany’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAccounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of the total accounts receivable,\nwere composed of three customers accounting for 61%, 22% and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts\nreceivable balance as of December 31, 2023. Two customers accounted for 67% and 33% of the Company’s accounts\nreceivable balance as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and SEC Rules\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), and the\nadoption had no impact on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements:\n1. ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures, as an amendment to ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\n2. ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract\nLiabilities from Contracts with Customers; and\n3. ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments\nOn September 29, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-04,\nLiabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,\nwhich enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of\ncapital. Under the new ASU, a company that uses a supplier finance program in connection with the purchase of goods\nor services will be required to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements\nto understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude.\nASU No. 2022-04 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022, except for the roll forward of the supplier finance program obligations, which is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this pronouncement as\nof January 1, 2023 did not have a material impact on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11216, Cybersecurity Risk Management,\nStrategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, requiring disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K\nand periodic disclosure of a registrant’s cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance in annual reports.\nThe Company has included the Regulation S-K Item 1C disclosure requirements under this rule in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Incident disclosure requirements in Form 8-K will be effective\nfor us on June 15, 2024.\nF-27\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES (cont.)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nOn September 30, 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, which (1) clarifies existing guidance when\nmeasuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity\nsecurity and (2) introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions.\nThe ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit\nof account of the equity security. Instead, the contractual sale restriction is a characteristic of the reporting entity.\nAccordingly, an entity should not consider the contractual sale restriction when measuring the equity security’s fair\nvalue. Additionally, the ASU clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a\ncontractual sale restriction. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has evaluated the\neffects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-03, and it is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, which incorporates 14 of the 27 disclosures referred to by\nthe SEC in their SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, issued on August 17, 2018. The\namendments in this ASU modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the Codification\nand apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected Topics unless otherwise indicated. The amendments\nin this ASU should be applied prospectively. For public business entities, the effective date for each amendment will\nbe the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes\neffective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company has evaluated the effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2022-03,\nand it is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures”, which amends and enhances the disclosure requirements for reportable segments.\nAll disclosure requirements under this standard will also be required for public entities with a single reportable\nsegment. The new standard will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,\nincluding interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing\nthe impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, “Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets”,\nwhich amends and enhances the disclosure requirements for crypto assets. The new requirements will be effective\nfor public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

The excess of the purchase\nprice over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination is recorded as goodwill.\nAirobotics Transaction\nOn January 23, 2023, the Company, completed the acquisition of Airobotics, pursuant to the Agreement of\nMerger, dated as of August 4, 2022 (the “Original Airobotics Agreement”), and that certain Amendment to Agreement\nof Merger, dated November 13, 2022 (the “Airobotics Amendment,” and together with the Original Airobotics\nAgreement, the “Airobotics Agreement”), by and among the Company, Talos Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Airobotics. In accordance with the terms of the Airobotics\nAgreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Airobotics (the “Merger”), with Airobotics continuing as the surviving\ncompany of the Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each ordinary share of Airobotics, par value NIS\n0.01 per share (the “Airobotics Ordinary Shares”), issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by Airobotics\nor its subsidiaries (dormant or otherwise) or by the Company or Merger Sub) was converted into, and exchanged\nfor 0.16806 (the “Exchange Ratio”) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Company, without\ninterest and subject to applicable tax withholdings (“Merger Consideration”). All fractional shares of the Company\nCommon Stock that would have otherwise been issued to a holder of Airobotics Ordinary Shares as part of the Merger\nConsideration were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on the total number of shares of the Company’s\nCommon Stock issued to such holder of Airobotics Ordinary Shares. Holders of Airobotics Ordinary Shares received\napproximately 2.8 million shares as consideration (excluding approximately 1.7 million shares underlying equity\nawards to be outstanding following the Merger).\nAs provided in the Airobotics Agreement, each outstanding option, warrant or other right, whether vested or\nunvested, to purchase Airobotics Ordinary Shares (each, an “Airobotics Stock Option,” and collectively, the “Airobotics\nStock Options”) issued pursuant to the Airobotics Ltd. 2015 Israeli Share Option Plan and 2020 Incentive Equity Plan\n(the “Airobotics Plans”), was assumed by Ondas and converted as of the Effective Time into an option, warrant or\nright, as applicable, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of the relevant Airobotics\nStock Option, each Airobotics Stock Option is deemed to constitute an option, warrant, or other right, as applicable,\nto purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Airobotics Stock Option, a\nnumber of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded\nup to the nearest whole share) that the holder of such Airobotics Stock Option would have been entitled to receive\npursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option, warrant, or right to purchase full Airobotics Ordinary\nShares immediately prior to the Effective Time at a price per share of Company Common Stock (rounded down to\nthe nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the former per share exercise price for Airobotics Ordinary Shares otherwise\npurchasable pursuant to such Airobotics Stock Option, divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company is dual listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) and the Tel\nAviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). The first trading day of the Company’s shares on TASE was January 26, 2023. On\nFebruary 8, 2024, the Company took steps to voluntarily delist the Company’s common stock from trading on\nTASE. Pursuant to Israeli law, the delisting of the Company’s Common Stock is expected to take effect three months\nfollowing the date of the Company’s request to the TASE to delist the Company’s common stock, which occurred on\nFebruary 8, 2024. The Company’s Common Stock will continue to be listed for trading on Nasdaq, and all of the shares\ntraded on the TASE are expected to be transferred to Nasdaq where they can continue to be traded.

In December 2023,\nthe Company bypassed the qualitative analysis and proceeded directly to a quantitative analysis. The Company engaged\na third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the Ondas Autonomous Systems reporting unit. Using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis and updated forecasts for revenue and cash flows, it was determined that the fair value\nof the Ondas Autonomous Systems reporting unit was higher than the carrying value as of December 31, 2023, and no\nfurther impairment to goodwill was necessary as of December 31, 2023.\nIn December 2022, the Company initially carried out a qualitative analysis and determined that because of changes\nin market conditions as well as a slower increase in revenue than previously forecast, it was more likely than not that\ngoodwill was impaired. The Company engaged a third-party service provider to carry out a valuation of the Ondas\nAutonomous Systems reporting unit. Using a discounted cash flow analysis and revised forecasts for revenue and cash\nflows that are lower than the previous valuation, it was determined that the fair value of the Ondas Autonomous Systems\nreporting unit was lower than the carrying value as of December 31, 2022, and an impairment of $19,419,600 was\nrecognized in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ending December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 6 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe components of intangible assets, all of which are finite lived, were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nGross Gross\nCarrying Accumulated Net Carrying Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Useful\nAmount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount Life\nPatents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 117,810 $ (43,153) $ 74,657 $ 82,431 $ (27,331) $ 55,100 10\nPatents in process . . . . . . . . 142,239 — 142,239 119,760 — 119,760 N/A\nLicenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 241,909 (89,859) 152,050 241,909 (65,665) 176,244 10\nSoftware . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 211,411 (167,412) 43,999 161,284 (84,682) 76,602 3\nTrademarks . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,230,000 (776,235) 2,453,765 3,230,000 (453,242) 2,776,758 10\nFAA waiver . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,930,000 (1,425,101) 4,504,899 5,930,000 (832,113) 5,097,887 10\nDeveloped technology . . . . . 27,977,331 (5,632,170) 22,345,161 23,270,614 (2,752,353) 20,518,261 3 – 10\nNon-compete agreements . . 840,000 (840,000) — 840,000 (840,000) — 1\nMarketing-related assets . . . 890,000 (82,540) 807,460 — — — 10\nCustomer relationships . . . . 1,010,000 (205,048) 804,952 60,000 (16,839) 43,161 5\n$ 40,590,700 $ (9,261,518) $ 31,329,182 $ 33,935,998 $ (5,072,225) $ 28,863,773\nF-32\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont.)\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4,147,092 and $3,570,090,\nrespectively.\nWe recognized losses on intellectual property of $12,223 and $12,343 due to expiration of patent applications\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOn March 20, 2022, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement to acquire the assets of Ardenna, Inc., a\nleading provider of image processing and machine learning software solutions for rail infrastructure monitoring and\ninspections.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the period when those temporary differences become deductible. Based on\nits assessment, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as their future\nutilization remains uncertain at this time.\nEffective with the issuance of redeemable preferred stock on July 21, 2023, Ondas Networks will not be a\nmember of the Company consolidated US tax filing.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company and Ondas Networks, respectively, had Federal NOLs of\napproximately $1 million and $15 million generated in 2007 to 2017 which will begin to expire in 2027 through\n2037. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and Ondas Networks,\nrespectively, had Federal NOLs of $59 million and $50 million, and of $42 million and $44 million, generated\nin 2018 through 2023 that have no expiration. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company and Ondas\nNetworks, respectively, had State NOLs available to offset future taxable income of $43 million and $92 million,\nand of $35 million and $72 million expiring from 2038 through 2043. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany and Ondas Networks, respectively, had approximately $0 and $752,000, and $0 and $752,000, of Federal\nresearch and development credits available to offset future tax liability expiring from 2038 through 2040. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $127 million and $0 of Israeli\nNOL’s. The Company’s Federal income tax returns for the 2020 to 2022 tax years remain open to examination\nby the IRS. Upon utilization of Federal NOLs in the future, the IRS may examine records from the year the loss\noccurred, even if outside the three-year statute of limitations. The Company’s State tax returns also remain open to\nexamination. The Company’s Israeli income tax returns for the 2019 to 2022 tax years remain open to examination.\nIn accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue code, the usage of the Company’s Federal Carryforwards\ncould be limited in the event of a change in ownership. As of December 31, 2021, the Company completed an analysis\nand determined that there were multiple ownership changes. Provided sufficient taxable income is generated the\nannual base limitation plus increased limitation calculated pursuant to IRS Notice 2003-65 will allow the Company to\nutilize all existing losses within the carryover periods.\nThe Company applies the FASB’s provisions for uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes the two-step\nprocess to determine the amount of recognized tax benefit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not\nthreshold, the amount recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes\ninterest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2023, management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions\nthat would require it to measure and reflect the potential lack of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial\nstatements. The Company will continue to evaluate its uncertain tax positions in future periods to determine if\nmeasurement and recognition in its financial statements is necessary. The Company does not believe there will be any\nmaterial changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next year.\nNOTE 14 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings, claims and assessments arising in the ordinary course of business.\nSuch matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. There are no such\nloss contingencies that are included in the financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\nF-47\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 15 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company had a long-term equity investment in Dynam with a carrying value of $0 and $1,500,000 as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The purchase price paid by the Ondas Purchasers for the Holdings\nShares was $1.12 per share.\nF-48\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (cont.)\nThe Ondas Offering was consummated on February 26, 2024. The Holdings Shares were offered and sold, and\nwere issued, pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement, dated February 26, 2024, to the Prospectus included in the New\nForm S-3. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Ondas Offering Securities for general\nworking capital purposes. See the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 for further\ndetails.\nPreferred Stock Investment in Ondas Networks\nOn February 26, 2024, Ondas Networks entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Networks\nAgreement”) for an investment of $4.50 million in Ondas Networks (the “Networks Offering,” and together with\nthe Ondas Offering, the “Offerings”). The Networks Agreement was entered into with the purchasers named therein\n(the “Networks Purchasers”) for the sale of shares of preferred stock for a purchase of $4.50 million. The Networks\nOffering was consummated on February 26, 2024.\nPursuant to the Networks Agreement, the Networks Purchasers would acquire the following in the Networks\nOffering for gross proceeds to Ondas Networks of $4.5 million: (i) 108,925 shares of preferred stock of Networks\nPreferred Stock, at a purchase price of $41.3104 per share (the “Per Share Price”), convertible into shares of Common\nStock, $0.00001 par value per share of Networks Common Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase 3,015,000 shares\nof the Company’s Common Stock, at an exercise price of $1.26 per share, exercisable commencing ninety days\nfollowing the date of issuance through the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Holdings Warrants,” and\ntogether with the Networks Preferred Stock, the “Networks Offering Securities”).\nThe Networks Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate per annum of eight percent (8%) of the original issue\nprice, of $41.3104 per share (the “Original Issue Price”). Dividends shall be payable only when, as, and if declared\nby the board of directors of Ondas Networks and Ondas Networks shall be under no obligation to pay such dividends.\nSuch dividends are payable in cash or additional shares of Networks Preferred Stock, with such valuation based on\nthe Original Issue Price. Each share of Networks Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at\nany time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such\nnumber of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Networks Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original\nIssue Price by the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion, which initially is set at $41.3104. In lieu of any\nfractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the number of shares of Networks Common Stock to\nbe issued upon conversion of the Networks Preferred Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. The Networks\nPreferred Stock can be redeemed as the request of the Holder at any time after the fifth anniversary for the greater of\nthe initial investment plus accrued dividends or the amount that would be due if the Networks Preferred Stock was\nconverted into Networks Common Stock as described above.\nPursuant to the Networks Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the\npurchasers to register the resale of the Company’s Common Stock underlying the Holdings Warrants pursuant to a\nregistration statement to be filed no later 180 days following the closing of the Networks Offering.

In addition, there was no general\nadvertisement conducted in connection with the sale of the OAH Warrants and Networks Offering Securities. See the\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 for further details.\nF-49\nONDAS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (cont.)\nAgreement and Waiver\nAs previously disclosed, on October 28, 2022, the Company issued the 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes,\npursuant to a Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and selected institutional investors (the “Investor”),\nas amended by the Amended SPA and the Agreement and Waiver. The 2022 Convertible Promissory Notes were\nconvertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock and were subsequently exchanged by the Company, on a\ndollar-for-dollar basis, into the 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes. The 2022 Convertible Exchange Notes have a\nmaturity date of April 28, 2025. On July 25, 2023, the Company issued the Additional Notes.\nOn February 23, 2024, the Company and the Investor entered into an Agreement and Waiver (the “Waiver”) with\nrespect to certain terms of the Notes. Pursuant to the Waiver, the Company and the Investor agreed that:\n• the Investor shall waive Section 4(q) of the SPA, solely with respect to the Offerings;\n• the Investor shall waive any right to adjust the Conversion Price (as defined in the Notes) of the Notes\npursuant to Section 7 of the Notes and any Additional Notes that may be issued from time as a result of the\nconsummation of all or any portion of the Offerings; and\n• the Investor shall waive any applicable provisions of the SPA or the Notes, including, without limitation,\nSection 13(f) of the Notes, Section 5(a) of the Notes, and Section 4(m)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement (but,\nin the case of Section 4(m)(iii) and in the interest of clarity, only with respect to issuances of securities of\nNetworks) such that the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including any “significant subsidiaries” (as\ndefined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) (“Company Subsidiaries” and each a “Company Subsidiary”)\nmay, directly or indirectly, including through Affiliates (as defined in the Notes) or otherwise, in one or\nmore transactions (including pursuant to a merger), sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose\nof (x) any of (including all or substantially all of) the properties or assets of Networks, or (y) any equity\ninterests (including a controlling equity interest) in Networks, in each case as would otherwise have\nrequired the affirmative consent or approval of Investor but for this waiver (each a “Waiver Transaction”),\nprovided that, as consideration for any Waiver Transaction, the Company receives (whether directly or via\na distribution from a Company Subsidiary) an amount in cash equal to no less than 125% of the principal\nand interest under the Notes and any Additional Notes then outstanding as of the date Company gives\nwritten notice to Investor of such Waiver Transaction.\nF-50\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as\nof December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief\nFinancial Officer have concluded that as of the period ended December 31, 2023 the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under\nthe Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board, senior management and other\npersonnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to\ntime make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
