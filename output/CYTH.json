biotechnology company dedicated to developing life-changing medicines through science and innovation for patients and families living with challenging diseases. Our lead therapeutic asset, Trappsol®  Cyclo™, is a proprietary formulation of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, and in multiple clinical studies has shown encouraging results to effectively manage the transportation of cholesterol. Taking the place of the defective NPC1 protein, Trappsol®  Cyclo™, with its cyclic structure, facilitates the transport of accumulated cholesterol out of cellular lysosomes so it can be further processed and excreted out of cells. Trappsol®  Cyclo™ is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the potential treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC), a rare, fatal and progressive genetic disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder.\n\n#### **Company Information**\n\n#### Address:P.O.
