The Company has filed to appeal the delisting determination and plans to leverage several strategic actions to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n\nNewGen had previously received two letters from Nasdaq in regard to its non-compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rules in May 2024. The first letter (the “MVPHS Deficiency Letter”) notified the Company that, for the preceding 35 consecutive business days of the MVPHS Deficiency Letter, the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares (the “Class A Shares”) did not meet the minimum $15,000,000 Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (“MVPHS”) requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5450(b)(2)(C) (the “MVPHS Requirement”). The second letter (the “MVLS Deficiency Letter”) notified the Company that, for the preceding 35 consecutive business days, the Class A Shares did not meet the minimum $50,000,000 Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5450(b)(2)(A) (the “MVLS Requirement”). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company had an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until November 20, 2024 (the “Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement and the MVLS Requirement.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Delisting Notice, the Company will formally request a hearing to appeal the delisting determination. This request will stay any further action by Nasdaq at least pending completion of the hearing and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel to the Company following the hearing. NewGen intends to leverage several strategic options to ensure its shares remain publicly traded. NewGen has secured two significant recent funding arrangements designed to strengthen its financial position and boost shareholders’ equity. The first of these is a senior convertible note facility with ATW Partners Opportunities Management, LLC, announced in an F-1 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 1, 2024, which will allow the Company to raise up to $29.48 million. The second is a $100 million equity line of credit, expandable to $500 million, with White Lion Capital, LLC (“White Lion”), under which NewGen will have the option, but not the obligation, to sell to White Lion up to $100.0 million in shares of common stock over an initial 36-month period, with the potential to increase to $300.0 million upon substantial M&A or merger activity, and further to $500.0 million after $250.0 million has been drawn. These funding mechanisms are expected to assist the Company in addressing its deficiencies and support its ongoing business operations. In addition, NewGen will apply to transfer the Company’s securities from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\n**About NewGen**\n\nNewGen is a comprehensive fertility services provider in Asia helping couples and individuals obtain access to fertility treatments.

Importantly, the agreement's built-in scalability, particularly the provision to increase to $300 million upon substantial M&A or merger activity, gives us the firepower to act decisively when further opportunities arise in our rapidly evolving market. The flexibility to draw capital at our discretion enables us to maintain our strong balance sheet while pursuing potential strategic acquisitions. Moreover, the 36-month term, extendable to 65 months, provides us with a long-term capital partner to support our growth initiatives. We welcome White Lion to our roster of shareholders and look forward to strategically deploying this capital to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value.”\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. \n\n**About NewGen**\n\nNewGen is a comprehensive fertility services provider in Asia helping couples and individuals obtain access to fertility treatments.
