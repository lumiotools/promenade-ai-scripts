(Nasdaq: INSG) (the “Company”), a technology leader in 5G mobile and fixed wireless solutions for mobile network operators, Fortune 500 enterprises and SMBs, today reported its results for the third quarter of 2024 ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“The third quarter had several positive, and meaningfully transformative events for Inseego, operationally, strategically and financially,” said Phil Brace, Executive Chairman of Inseego. “The closing of our convertible note restructuring and the announced sale of our Telematics business have allowed us to deliver on our commitment to improve the Company’s capital structure. In addition, our operating results in the quarter were the best they have been in several years. Our focus now is on addressing our 5G pipeline and continuing the trajectory as we develop new products and look to drive long-term growth.”\n\n“We continue to be focused on driving stockholder value and are pleased to have restructured 91% of our outstanding convertible notes, meaningfully reducing debt and right-sizing the Company’s capital structure,” Steven Gatoff, Chief Financial Officer of Inseego, commented. “The $52 million in cash we anticipate receiving from the closing of the sale of Telematics will add additional liquidity and flexibility for the Company. On the operational front, Q3 was a pivotal quarter in which we delivered a big revenue quarter and generated strong Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow, along with positive GAAP Operating and Net Income.”\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\nThe following financial highlights present the results of operations of the Company for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As mentioned above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its telematics solutions business (the “Telematics Business”) for approximately $52 million in cash. Therefore, all results of operations related to the Telematics Business herein are reported as relating to ‘discontinued operations’, while the Company’s ongoing businesses are being reported as relating to ‘continuing operations’.\n\n  * Revenue from continuing operations and discontinued operations for Q3 2024 was $61.9 million, comprised of revenue from continuing operations of $54.0 million and revenue from discontinued operations of $7.9 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and discontinued operations for Q3 2024 was $9.3 million, comprised of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $6.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations of $2.6 million.\n  * Gross margin from continuing operations for Q3 2024 was 34.8%, while that from discontinued operations was 59.0%, resulting in a blended rate of 37.9%.\n\n\n\n**Capital Structure Improvements**\n\n  * On November 6, 2024, the Company completed its capital structure management initiative and material debt reduction by exchanging $91.5 million of principal value of the Company’s 3.25% convertible notes due 2025 for long-term debt and equity; the Company has now repurchased or exchanged at a discount approximately $147 million, or 91% of aggregate principal amount, of the $162 million of the convertible notes that were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. See separate press release also issued on November 12, 2024 for further details.\n  * Paid-down the Company’s short-term loan throughout the third quarter from an initial $19.5 million to be $6 million as of September 30,2024.\n\n\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Hosted inaugural Channel Partner Advisory Council with key, strategic partners.\n  * Onboarded 12 new Inseego Ignite partners in Q3, several of which produced immediate revenue.\n  * Launched the multi-carrier certified 5G indoor router FX3110 to the Inseego Ignite channel program and closed new channel deals driving immediate revenue for this program.\n  * Launched the first MiFi® specifically for the Inseego Ignite channel program with all tier 1 North American operator certifications and closed the first channel deal with a new win at a Fortune 150 utility company to enable their remote workforce with secure, mobile connectivity.\n  * Launched Inseego products in the new T-Mobile Virtual Inventory Program.\n  * Increased MiFi® X PRO sales sequentially across carriers, including one who continues to see increased demand with an emphasis on public sector customers.\n\n\n\n**Q4 2024 Guidance**\n\nAs the sale of the Company’s telematics business is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024, that business is reported as discontinued operations, and the following guidance is reflective of solely the expected results of the Company’s continuing operations. In other words, the Company’s guidance for Q4 2024 excludes any impact of expected results from the Company’s telematics operations.\n\n  * Total revenue from continuing operations in the range of $43.0 million to $47.0 million compared to revenue from continuing operations for Q3 2024 of $54.0 million and revenue from continuing operations for Q4 2023 of $35.9 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the range of $3.0 million to $4.0 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for Q3 2024 of $6.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for Q4 2023 of $2.3 million.\n\n\n\n**Q4 2023****ACTUAL** | **Q3 2024****ACTUAL** | **Q4 2024****GUIDANCE**  \n---|---|---  \n**Revenue** (from continuing operations) | $35.9m | $54.0m | $43.0m - $47.0m  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** (from continuing operations) | $2.3m | $6.7m | $3.0m - $4.0m  \n  \n**Conference Call Information**\n\nInseego will host a conference call and live webcast today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “may,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “will” and similar words and phrases indicating future results. The information presented in this news release related to our future business outlook, the future demand for our products, and other statements that are not purely historical facts are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections. They are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. We, therefore, cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations.\n\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include: (1) the Company’s dependence on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues; (2) the future demand for wireless broadband access to data and asset management software and services and our ability to accurately forecast; (3) the growth of wireless wide-area networking and asset management software and services; (4) customer and end-user acceptance of the Company’s current product and service offerings and market demand for the Company’s anticipated new product and service offerings; (5) our ability to develop sales channels and to onboard channel partners; (6) increased competition and pricing pressure from participants in the markets in which the Company is engaged; (7) dependence on third-party manufacturers and key component suppliers worldwide; (8) the impact of fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates; (9) the impact of supply chain challenges on our ability to source components and manufacture our products; (10) unexpected liabilities or expenses; (11) the Company’s ability to introduce new products and services in a timely manner, including the ability to develop and launch 5G products at the speed and functionality required by our customers; (12) litigation, regulatory and IP developments related to our products or components of our products; (13) the Company’s ability to raise additional financing when the Company requires capital for operations or to satisfy corporate obligations; (14) the Company’s plans and expectations relating to acquisitions, divestitures, strategic relationships, international expansion, software and hardware developments, personnel matters, and cost containment initiatives, including restructuring activities and the timing of their implementations; (15) the global semiconductor shortage and any related price increases or supply chain disruptions, (16) the potential impact of COVID-19 or other global public health emergencies on the business, (17) the impact of high rates of inflation and rising interest rates, (18) the impact of import tariffs on our materials and products, and (19) the impact of geopolitical instability on our business.\n\nThese factors, as well as other factors set forth as risk factors or otherwise described in the reports filed by the Company with the SEC (available at [www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/)), could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future, except as otherwise required under applicable law and our ongoing reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nInseego Corp. has provided financial information in this press release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, for example, exclude preferred stock dividends, share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions, amortization of discount and issuance costs related to our 2025 Notes and revolving credit facility, fair value adjustments on derivative instruments, and other non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment of capitalized software, impairment of long-lived assets, debt restructuring costs and divestiture related costs, along with certain other non-recurring expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP cost of revenues, and non-GAAP operating costs and expenses are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. They are not intended to be used in isolation or as a substitute for cost of revenues, operating expenses, net loss, net loss per share or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we consider them to be an important supplemental performance measure.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to make operational decisions, evaluate our performance, prepare forecasts and determine compensation. Further, management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Share-based compensation expenses are expected to vary depending on the number of new incentive award grants issued to both current and new employees, the number of such grants forfeited by former employees, and changes in our stock price, stock market volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates, all of which are difficult to estimate. In calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain non-cash and one-time items to facilitate comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such expenses are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use this view of our operating performance to compare it with the business plan and individual operating budgets and in the allocation of resources.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors in providing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision-making. The Company believes that using these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparing our underlying operating performance with other companies in our industry, which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\n\nIn the future, we expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and the exclusion of these items in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Investors and potential investors are cautioned that material limitations are associated with using non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. The limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include, but are not limited to, the fact that other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool.\n\nInvestors and potential investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures in this press release with our GAAP financial results.\n\n**Investor Relations

(Nasdaq: INSG) (the “Company”), a technology leader in 5G mobile and fixed wireless solutions for mobile network operators, Fortune 500 enterprises and SMBs, announced today that it has completed its initiative to overhaul the Company’s capital structure to reduce total debt and restructure its outstanding 3.25% convertible notes due 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”).\n\nOn November 6, 2024, the Company executed the exchange (the “Exchange Transactions”) of $91.5 million of face value of the 2025 Convertible Notes held by certain holders (the “Exchanging Noteholders”) pursuant to agreements that were previously entered into. In connection with the Exchange Transactions, the Company issued to the Exchanging Noteholders in concurrent private placement transactions an aggregate of (i) approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Shares”), (ii) approximately $40.9 million in principal amount of new senior secured notes due in 2029 (the “New Senior Secured Notes”), and (iii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 2.1 million shares of Common Stock (the “Exchange Warrants”).\n\nPrior to the Exchange Transactions, the Company had previously completed discounted repurchases of an aggregate of $55.5 million face value of the Convertible Notes during the second and third quarters of 2024 for a combination of cash and equity.\n\nThe Company has now repurchased or exchanged approximately $147 million, or 91% of aggregate principal amount, of the $162 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes that were previously outstanding, materially reducing its debt level and leaving a small remaining stub of approximately $15 million of the 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding. In the aggregate, in connection with all of the transactions to restructure the Company’s 2025 Convertible Notes, including the short-term loan entered into on June 28, 2024, the Company issued approximately 2.9 million shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 3.0 million shares of Common Stock.\n\n“Completing the restructuring of the 2025 Convertible Notes is a significant milestone for Inseego,” said Inseego Executive Chairman Philip Brace. “Inseego moves ahead in a much stronger position to invest in new products and market opportunities to grow our business and further increase stockholder value.”\n\nThe New Senior Secured Notes bear interest at 9.0% per annum, to be paid in cash, in arrears, on a semi-annual basis, and will have a maturity date of May 1, 2029. The New Senior Secured Notes are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of Company’s assets. The New Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants customary for such senior secured debt.\n\nThe Exchange Warrants have exercise prices ranging from $11.27 to $15.77 per share of Common Stock (that were based on a $2.00 premium to the NASDAQ Minimum Price as of the date that the applicable Exchange Term Sheet was executed). The Exchange Warrants expire four years from the date of issuance and will be exercisable on a cash basis.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have completed our restructuring and material debt reduction. By reducing the Company’s leverage and right-sizing the capital structure, we believe we have re-positioned Inseego to a position of strength for future success,” said Steven Gatoff, Inseego Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs of the date hereof, affiliates of two of the Exchanging Noteholders - Golden Harbor Ltd. and North Sound Partners - may be deemed to beneficially own more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock. James B. Avery, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, currently serves as Senior Managing Director of Tavistock Group, an affiliate of Golden Harbor Ltd.\n\nRaymond James served as financial advisor and Greenberg Traurig LLP served as counsel to the Company in connection with the restructuring transactions.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to the 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available on Inseego’s investor relations website.\n\n**About Inseego Corp.**\n\nInseego Corp.

They are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. We, therefore, cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations.\n\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include: (1) the Company’s dependence on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues; (2) the future demand for wireless broadband access to data and asset management software and services and our ability to accurately forecast; (3) the growth of wireless wide-area networking and asset management software and services; (4) customer and end-user acceptance of the Company’s current product and service offerings and market demand for the Company’s anticipated new product and service offerings; (5) our ability to develop sales channels and to onboard channel partners; (6) increased competition and pricing pressure from participants in the markets in which the Company is engaged; (7) dependence on third-party manufacturers and key component suppliers worldwide; (8) the impact of fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates; (9) the impact of supply chain challenges on our ability to source components and manufacture our products; (10) unexpected liabilities or expenses; (11) the Company’s ability to introduce new products and services in a timely manner, including the ability to develop and launch 5G products at the speed and functionality required by our customers; (12) litigation, regulatory and IP developments related to our products or components of our products; (13) the Company’s ability to raise additional financing when the Company requires capital for operations or to satisfy corporate obligations; (14) the Company’s plans and expectations relating to acquisitions, divestitures, strategic relationships, international expansion, software and hardware developments, personnel matters, and cost containment initiatives, including the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the planned sale of the Company’s telematics business, as well as restructuring activities and the timing of their implementations; (15) the global semiconductor shortage and any related price increases or supply chain disruptions, (16) the potential impact of COVID-19 or other global public health emergencies on the business, (17) the impact of high rates of inflation and rising interest rates, (18) the impact of import tariffs on our materials and products, and (19) the impact of geopolitical instability on our business.\n\nThese factors, as well as other factors set forth as risk factors or otherwise described in the reports filed by the Company with the SEC (available at [www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/)), could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future, except as otherwise required under applicable law and our ongoing reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nSource: Inseego
