(“Assertio” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Third quarter results reflected solid performance as we continue to establish Rolvedon as our lead asset and drive economic returns from our commercial portfolio,” said Brendan O’Grady, Chief Executive Officer. “Rolvedon has been well received by physicians, posting another quarter of stable performance and the continued expansion of our customer base. The Rolvedon same day dosing trial has concluded and the results have been accepted for presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2024.”\n\n“Additionally, we have implemented new sales and marketing tactics for Sympazan, which are designed to drive prescriber awareness and prescription growth in key markets. We are maintaining our share of Indocin and working to maximize the value of this product and our other commercial assets moving forward. We are also evaluating new approaches to grow existing assets as well as the acquisition of additional assets to fuel further growth.”\n\n**Financial Highlights (unaudited):**\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n _(in millions, except per share amounts)_| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net Product Sales (GAAP)**| **$**| **28.7**| **$**| **30.7**| **$**| **35.1**| **$**| **91.3**| **$**| **117.0**  \n**Net Loss (GAAP)**| **$**| **(2.9**| **)**| **$**| **(3.7**| **)**| **$**| **(279.5**| **)**| **$**| **(11.1**| **)**| **$**| **(274.6**| **)**  \n**Loss Per Share (GAAP)**| **$**| **(0.03**| **)**| **$**| **(0.04**| **)**| **$**| **(3.42**| **)**| **$**| **(0.12**| **)**| **$**| **(4.35**| **)**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 1**| **$**| **5.3**| **$**| **5.0**| **$**| **12.9**| **$**| **17.7**| **$**| **63.3**  \n**Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP) 1**| **$**| **0.03**| **$**| **0.02**| **$**| **0.01**| **$**| **0.09**| **$**| **0.46**  \n  \nThird quarter results included the following highlights (our discussion below focuses on a comparison of third quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 given the acquisition of Spectrum and the generic competition of Indocin introduced in the third quarter 2023):\n\n  * Rolvedon net product sales were stable at $15.0 million in the third quarter, from $15.1 million in the second quarter, driven by continued volume growth offset by lower net pricing. \n  * Indocin net product sales in the third quarter were $5.7 million, decreased from $6.9 million in the second quarter, due to the previously announced generic competition affecting pricing.\n  * Gross margin2 in the third quarter increased to 74%, from 71% in the second quarter, primarily due a decrease in the level of inventory write downs in late life-cycle stage products and the completion of Rolvedon inventory step-up amortization.\n  * SG&A expense in the third quarter was $16.7 million, decreased from $18.4 million in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing and other general and administrative costs, partially offset by net higher legal related charges.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA3 was $5.3 million in the third quarter, increased from $5.0 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A expense, partially offset by lower net product sales. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $88.6 million, compared with $88.4 million at June 30, 2024. Cash flow generation during the quarter was impacted by the timing of working capital as well as lower net product sales.\n  * Debt at September 30, 2024 was $40.0 million, comprised of the Company’s 6.5% convertible notes, with no maturities until September 2027.\n\n\n\n**Board Updates**\n\nPeter Staple retired from the board after more than 20 years as an independent director. Also, Dr. Jeffrey Vacirca has elected to depart from the board to focus on his other business interests. Both departures were effective November 7, 2024.\n\nAssertio announced the appointment of Heather Mason as Board Chair. Mason has served as an independent director since 2019 and as interim CEO of Assertio from January to May of 2024. Further, David Stark was appointed to the board as an independent director and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Stark was previously Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited.\n\n“I want thank Jeff and Peter for their service to Assertio and its shareholders,” said Mason. “Jeff’s insight into the oncology market since joining the board as part of the Spectrum transaction has been invaluable. Peter has served for more than 20 years on the Assertio board, offering calm leadership and wise counsel through transitions and challenges faced by the organization during his tenure. I also appreciate Peter extending his board service during the time of transition to Brendan O’Grady as the new CEO. I want to welcome David to the board and look forward to his partnership. David brings extensive litigation, compliance and acquisition experience from his time at Teva and earlier in private law firm practice.”\n\n**Conference Call and Investor Presentation Information**\n\nAssertio’s management will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results today:\n\nDate:| Monday, November 11, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime:| 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time  \nWebcast (live and archive):| <http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx>(Events & Webcasts, Investor Page)  \nDial-in numbers:| 1-646-307-1963, Conference ID 3278948  \n  \nTo access the live webcast, the recorded conference call replay, and other materials, please visit Assertio’s investor relations website at [http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y0guvNNq0B-qlDw9ruP1yPj1LUoDTCgIhAOBqDKSLj_LHAIrISZvu2dGK2osbJAnY4jqBmL5glOJFcOHYpRQV2Yzu_CPcK_GR1iDEh4_x7_F-VdhtdaOSPhiEpjpKyOAORPjZrxG15fmbD9LviUHKypw9T76JFkoxtzLgAO42zvCMRrMywLpSuh3TVVZt5O8).

Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, based on current beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “approximate”, “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “prospective,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements, including: Assertio’s ability to grow sales of, and the commercial success and market acceptance of, Rolvedon and Assertio’s other products; Assertio’s ability to successfully develop and execute its sales, marketing and promotion strategies using its sales force and non-personal promotion model capabilities; the impact on sales and profits from the entry and sales of generics of Assertio’s products and/or other products competitive with any of Assertio’s products (including indomethacin suppositories compounded by hospitals and other institutions including a 503B compounder which we believe to be violation of certain provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act); the timing and impact of additional generic approvals and uncertainty around the recent approvals and launches of generic Indocin products (which are not patent protected and now face generic competition as a result of the August 2023 approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories and January 2024 approval and subsequent launch of a generic indomethacin oral suspension product); risks that any new businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize estimated cost savings, value of certain tax assets, synergies and growth, or that such benefits may take longer and/or cost more to realize than expected; expected industry trends, including pricing pressures and managed healthcare practices; Assertio’s ability to attract and retain executive leadership and key employees; the ability of Assertio’s third-party manufacturers to manufacture adequate quantities of commercially salable inventory and active pharmaceutical ingredients for each of Assertio’s products on commercially reasonable terms and in compliance with their contractual obligations to Assertio, and Assertio’s ability to maintain its supply chain which relies on single-source suppliers; the outcome of, and Assertio’s intentions with respect to, any litigation or government investigations, including pending and potential future shareholder litigation relating to the Spectrum Merger and/or the recent approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories, opioid-related government investigations and opioid-related litigation, the recently unsealed qui tam litigation, as well as Spectrum’s legacy shareholder and other litigation and, and other disputes and litigation, and the costs and expenses associated therewith; Assertio’s financial cost and outcomes of clinical trials, including the extent to which data from the Rolvedon same-day dosing trial may support ongoing commercialization efforts; Assertio’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to the development or promotion of its products; variations in revenues obtained from commercialization agreements and the accounting treatment with respect thereto; Assertio’s common stock maintaining compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s minimum closing bid requirement of at least $1.00 per share, particularly in light of Assertio’s stock trading below or only slightly above $1.00 per share recently as well as recent market activity by a short seller; and Assertio’s ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for its products and operate its business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the risks described in Assertio’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by public health emergencies and general macroeconomic conditions. Assertio does not assume, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the Company’s financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, the Company has included information about non-GAAP measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share as useful operating metrics. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and the Company’s management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company’s performance, and in part, in the determination of bonuses for executive officers and employees. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n**Specified Items**\n\nNon-GAAP measures presented within this release exclude specified items. The Company considers specified items to be significant income/expense items not indicative of current operations. Specified items may include adjustments to interest expense and interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, amortization expense, sales reserves adjustments for products the Company is no longer selling, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration or derivative liability, restructuring charges, amortization of fair value inventory step-up as a result of purchase accounting, transaction-related costs, gains, losses or impairments from adjustments to long-lived assets and assets not part of current operations, changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and gains or losses resulting from debt refinancing or extinguishment.\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS****(in thousands,

As a result, interest expense, net of tax, and any other income statement impact associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of tax, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP net loss and diluted net loss per share, and the potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method were not included in non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method was not included in the computation of both non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and GAAP diluted net loss per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.

(“Assertio” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, today issued the following letter from Chief Executive Officer Brendan O’Grady in response to public comments made November 8, 2024 by a short-seller:\n\nTo the members of the investment community,\n\nAs many of you have been aware, Mr. Alex Parker, who operates Buxton Hemsley Group, Inc. (an investment advisor reporting $3 million in regulatory assets under management), announced his position as an activist investor in Assertio in April prior to my joining as CEO. Over the course of the past six months, Mr. Parker has wasted management and the board’s resources with the same repeated and baseless allegations. His allegations were nevertheless taken seriously by Assertio and were investigated only to be found completely without merit.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Parker made categorically false allegations concerning the safety and approval of Rolvedon and Assertio’s accounting practices. First, the Rolvedon BLA was fully reviewed by multiple professional firms who had access to the allegations made by the purported whistleblowers. Second, as Assertio has previously disclosed, the accounting charges for intangible asset impairments following the Spectrum merger were made in accordance with clear accounting principles. These facts have been communicated with the relevant details to Mr. Parker multiple times.\n\nAfter six months of unsuccessful attempts to extract money and a board position from Assertio, Mr. Parker, through his lawyers, contacted our legal team and proposed that Assertio pay his legal fees in exchange for dropping his activist activities. Our legal team asked BHG’s counsel to put his offer on paper for our board to review and discuss. That was two weeks ago and an offer from Mr. Parker never came.\n\nInstead, this past Friday, November 8, Mr. Parker shifted tactics, again releasing a number of false statements and baseless allegations against the company. At the same time, he stated he moved from activist investor to a short seller of our stock. We are reviewing all legal options, including referring Mr. Parker to the appropriate regulatory and enforcement authorities. We will continue to vigorously refute these baseless assertions against Assertio.\n\nI want to assure you that I am confident that there has been no wrongdoing on the part of Assertio. I look forward to our Q3 earnings release and call later today and to putting this distraction behind us so we can focus on our mission to grow Assertio and deliver value to the patients we serve as well as all of our stakeholders.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrendan O’GradyChief Executive Officer and Board Member Assertio Holdings, Inc.\n\n**About Assertio**\n\nAssertio is a commercial pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients.

(“Assertio” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ASRT), a pharmaceutical company with comprehensive commercial capabilities offering differentiated products to patients, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Third quarter results reflected solid performance as we continue to establish Rolvedon as our lead asset and drive economic returns from our commercial portfolio,” said Brendan O’Grady, Chief Executive Officer. “Rolvedon has been well received by physicians, posting another quarter of stable performance and the continued expansion of our customer base. The Rolvedon same day dosing trial has concluded and the results have been accepted for presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2024.”\n\n“Additionally, we have implemented new sales and marketing tactics for Sympazan, which are designed to drive prescriber awareness and prescription growth in key markets. We are maintaining our share of Indocin and working to maximize the value of this product and our other commercial assets moving forward. We are also evaluating new approaches to grow existing assets as well as the acquisition of additional assets to fuel further growth.”\n\n**Financial Highlights (unaudited):**\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n _(in millions, except per share amounts)_| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net Product Sales (GAAP)**| **$**| **28.7**| **$**| **30.7**| **$**| **35.1**| **$**| **91.3**| **$**| **117.0**  \n**Net Loss (GAAP)**| **$**| **(2.9**| **)**| **$**| **(3.7**| **)**| **$**| **(279.5**| **)**| **$**| **(11.1**| **)**| **$**| **(274.6**| **)**  \n**Loss Per Share (GAAP)**| **$**| **(0.03**| **)**| **$**| **(0.04**| **)**| **$**| **(3.42**| **)**| **$**| **(0.12**| **)**| **$**| **(4.35**| **)**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 1**| **$**| **5.3**| **$**| **5.0**| **$**| **12.9**| **$**| **17.7**| **$**| **63.3**  \n**Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP) 1**| **$**| **0.03**| **$**| **0.02**| **$**| **0.01**| **$**| **0.09**| **$**| **0.46**  \n  \nThird quarter results included the following highlights (our discussion below focuses on a comparison of third quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 given the acquisition of Spectrum and the generic competition of Indocin introduced in the third quarter 2023):\n\n  * Rolvedon net product sales were stable at $15.0 million in the third quarter, from $15.1 million in the second quarter, driven by continued volume growth offset by lower net pricing. \n  * Indocin net product sales in the third quarter were $5.7 million, decreased from $6.9 million in the second quarter, due to the previously announced generic competition affecting pricing.\n  * Gross margin2 in the third quarter increased to 74%, from 71% in the second quarter, primarily due a decrease in the level of inventory write downs in late life-cycle stage products and the completion of Rolvedon inventory step-up amortization.\n  * SG&A expense in the third quarter was $16.7 million, decreased from $18.4 million in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and marketing and other general and administrative costs, partially offset by net higher legal related charges.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA3 was $5.3 million in the third quarter, increased from $5.0 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A expense, partially offset by lower net product sales. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\n  * For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $88.6 million, compared with $88.4 million at June 30, 2024. Cash flow generation during the quarter was impacted by the timing of working capital as well as lower net product sales.\n  * Debt at September 30, 2024 was $40.0 million, comprised of the Company’s 6.5% convertible notes, with no maturities until September 2027.\n\n\n\n**Board Updates**\n\nPeter Staple retired from the board after more than 20 years as an independent director. Also, Dr. Jeffrey Vacirca has elected to depart from the board to focus on his other business interests. Both departures were effective November 7, 2024.\n\nAssertio announced the appointment of Heather Mason as Board Chair. Mason has served as an independent director since 2019 and as interim CEO of Assertio from January to May of 2024. Further, David Stark was appointed to the board as an independent director and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Stark was previously Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited.\n\n“I want thank Jeff and Peter for their service to Assertio and its shareholders,” said Mason. “Jeff’s insight into the oncology market since joining the board as part of the Spectrum transaction has been invaluable. Peter has served for more than 20 years on the Assertio board, offering calm leadership and wise counsel through transitions and challenges faced by the organization during his tenure. I also appreciate Peter extending his board service during the time of transition to Brendan O’Grady as the new CEO. I want to welcome David to the board and look forward to his partnership. David brings extensive litigation, compliance and acquisition experience from his time at Teva and earlier in private law firm practice.”\n\n**Conference Call and Investor Presentation Information**\n\nAssertio’s management will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results today:\n\nDate:| Monday, November 11, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime:| 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time  \nWebcast (live and archive):| <http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx>(Events & Webcasts, Investor Page)  \nDial-in numbers:| 1-646-307-1963, Conference ID 3278948  \n  \nTo access the live webcast, the recorded conference call replay, and other materials, please visit Assertio’s investor relations website at [http://investor.assertiotx.com/overview/default.aspx](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y0guvNNq0B-qlDw9ruP1yPj1LUoDTCgIhAOBqDKSLj_LHAIrISZvu2dGK2osbJAnY4jqBmL5glOJFcOHYpRQV2Yzu_CPcK_GR1iDEh4_x7_F-VdhtdaOSPhiEpjpKyOAORPjZrxG15fmbD9LviUHKypw9T76JFkoxtzLgAO42zvCMRrMywLpSuh3TVVZt5O8).

Forward-looking statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, based on current beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as there can be no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “approximate”, “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “prospective,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements, including: Assertio’s ability to grow sales of, and the commercial success and market acceptance of, Rolvedon and Assertio’s other products; Assertio’s ability to successfully develop and execute its sales, marketing and promotion strategies using its sales force and non-personal promotion model capabilities; the impact on sales and profits from the entry and sales of generics of Assertio’s products and/or other products competitive with any of Assertio’s products (including indomethacin suppositories compounded by hospitals and other institutions including a 503B compounder which we believe to be violation of certain provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act); the timing and impact of additional generic approvals and uncertainty around the recent approvals and launches of generic Indocin products (which are not patent protected and now face generic competition as a result of the August 2023 approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories and January 2024 approval and subsequent launch of a generic indomethacin oral suspension product); risks that any new businesses will not be integrated successfully or that the combined company will not realize estimated cost savings, value of certain tax assets, synergies and growth, or that such benefits may take longer and/or cost more to realize than expected; expected industry trends, including pricing pressures and managed healthcare practices; Assertio’s ability to attract and retain executive leadership and key employees; the ability of Assertio’s third-party manufacturers to manufacture adequate quantities of commercially salable inventory and active pharmaceutical ingredients for each of Assertio’s products on commercially reasonable terms and in compliance with their contractual obligations to Assertio, and Assertio’s ability to maintain its supply chain which relies on single-source suppliers; the outcome of, and Assertio’s intentions with respect to, any litigation or government investigations, including pending and potential future shareholder litigation relating to the Spectrum Merger and/or the recent approval and launch of generic indomethacin suppositories, opioid-related government investigations and opioid-related litigation, the recently unsealed qui tam litigation, as well as Spectrum’s legacy shareholder and other litigation and, and other disputes and litigation, and the costs and expenses associated therewith; Assertio’s financial cost and outcomes of clinical trials, including the extent to which data from the Rolvedon same-day dosing trial may support ongoing commercialization efforts; Assertio’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to the development or promotion of its products; variations in revenues obtained from commercialization agreements and the accounting treatment with respect thereto; Assertio’s common stock maintaining compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market’s minimum closing bid requirement of at least $1.00 per share, particularly in light of Assertio’s stock trading below or only slightly above $1.00 per share recently as well as recent market activity by a short seller; and Assertio’s ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for its products and operate its business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking statements, see the risks described in Assertio’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by public health emergencies and general macroeconomic conditions. Assertio does not assume, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement the Company’s financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, the Company has included information about non-GAAP measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share as useful operating metrics. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and the Company’s management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company’s performance, and in part, in the determination of bonuses for executive officers and employees. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n**Specified Items**\n\nNon-GAAP measures presented within this release exclude specified items. The Company considers specified items to be significant income/expense items not indicative of current operations. Specified items may include adjustments to interest expense and interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, amortization expense, sales reserves adjustments for products the Company is no longer selling, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration or derivative liability, restructuring charges, amortization of fair value inventory step-up as a result of purchase accounting, transaction-related costs, gains, losses or impairments from adjustments to long-lived assets and assets not part of current operations, changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and gains or losses resulting from debt refinancing or extinguishment.\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS****(in thousands,

The Company uses the if-converted method with respect to its convertible debt to compute GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when the effect is dilutive. Under the if-converted method, the Company assumes the 2027 Convertible Notes were converted at the beginning of each period presented and outstanding. As a result, interest expense, net of tax, and any other income statement impact associated with the 2027 Convertible Notes, net of tax, is added back to net income used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method and stock-based awards under the treasury-stock method were not included in the computation of GAAP net loss and diluted net loss per share, and the potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method were not included in non-GAAP adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s potentially dilutive convertible debt under the if-converted method was not included in the computation of both non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and GAAP diluted net loss per share, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.
