The units are expected to be listed on The NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) and trade under the ticker symbol “AFJKU” beginning December 1, 2023. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one right. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. No fractional rights will be issued upon separation of the units. As a result, 5 rights are needed to receive one ordinary share at the closing of the initial business combination. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock and rights are expected to be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols “AFJK” and “AFJKR”, respectively.\n\nThe underwriters have been granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units offered by the Company to cover over-allotments, if any.\n\nThe offering is expected to close on December 5, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nSpartan Capital Securities, LLC acted as sole book running manager in the offering.

This policy facilitates strategic investments and partnerships, providing a clear path to access China’s vast market while supporting the global expansion of Chinese enterprises. Cross-border equity swaps, a key feature, enable partnerships that go beyond traditional investment models, offering more flexible opportunities. By streamlining investment processes and enhancing governance, the policy fosters long-term, mutually beneficial relationships in key sectors like technology, industrials, and energy. This is the moment for foreign investors to capitalize on China’s economic transformation and drive global growth and innovation.\n\n## 1. Policy Background and Key Changes\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, among other departments, have jointly issued the “Measures for the Administration of Strategic Investment in Listed Companies by Foreign Investors” ((Decree No. 3 of 2024, hereinafter referred to as the **“New Measures** ”), effective on December 2, 2024.\n\nThe updated measures build on the 2005 version (Decree No. 28 of 2005, hereinafter referred to as the **“Old Measures** ”), highlighting China’s commitment to opening its capital markets and providing clear pathways for global investors while supporting the international growth of Chinese enterprises.\n\n### Major Changes in the New Measures\n\nCompared to the Old Measures, the New Measures have made the following adjustments to further encourage foreign strategic investment:\n\n### ![Table showing changes in rules regarding foreign ownership of listed companies](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/china-foreign-ownership-changes-960B.png?x51944)Other Key Updates:\n\n  * Foreign investors must disclose holdings via QFII/RQFII and Stock Connect.\n  * **Cross-border equity swaps are now permitted.**\n  * Streamlined post-investment reporting to commerce authorities.\n  * Professional opinions required to ensure compliance with foreign strategic investments.\n\n\n\n## 2. Strategic Opportunities: Focus on Cross-Border Investment and Partnerships\n\n**1) Enhancing Foreign Investment Opportunities through Cross-Border Equity Swaps**\n\nThe New Measures present a fresh, powerful opportunity for foreign investors and Chinese companies alike through cross-border equity swaps. Key benefits include:\n\n  * Lower Entry Barriers: Fewer restrictions on shareholding ratios make it more straightforward for foreign investors to acquire significant stakes in Chinese firms. Chinese businesses, in turn, gain access to global capital, enhancing their ability to scale more rapidly. While most mergers and acquisitions today are settled in cash, the relaxation of cross-border equity swaps encourages the use of alternative financial tools, offering more flexible investment options.\n  * Strategic Flexibility: Cross-border equity swaps open the door for more customized investment structures, enabling investors and Chinese companies to create strategic partnerships that support global expansion.\n  * Access to High-Growth Markets and Strategic Sectors: Foreign investors now have enhanced access to China’s rapidly growing sectors, including industrials, high technology, and energy, where government policies are driving modernization and attracting significant investments. Key foreign strategic investments are increasingly focused on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through equity swaps and joint ventures, supporting SOE reforms and fostering international partnerships. Additionally, sectors like energy and power are benefiting from policies that encourage cross-border collaboration and long-term growth.\n\n\n\n**2) Simplifying Investment Processes and Enhancing Governance**\n\nWith the New Measures, the regulatory process has been streamlined. The shift to post-investment reporting significantly cuts down approval times, making it easier and faster for foreign investors to close deals. Chinese companies are also encouraged to strengthen their governance practices, ensuring greater transparency. Stronger governance means less risk, building foreign investors’ confidence when they engage in joint ventures or acquisitions.\n\n**3) Strengthening Strategic Partnerships and Expanding Market Reach**\n\nThe New Measures pave the way for deeper, long-term relationships between foreign investors and Chinese companies. Cross-border equity swaps lay the foundation for these partnerships, offering access to China’s large consumer market and integrating foreign firms into global supply chains. Collaborating with local Chinese companies also gives foreign investors valuable insights, helping them navigate and innovate within China’s fast-changing business environment.\n\nAs noted by Hutong Research in the “China Economy Q&A” report, policy changes like the debt-mitigation plan, which allows local governments to settle payments to vendors and employees, are expected to be more effective than direct stimulus in boosting investor confidence. These measures, along with the “New Measures” that ease asset requirements and reduce lock-up periods, align with China’s broader goal to create a more investor-friendly environment, offering strategic opportunities for global expansion and partnership.\n\n## 3. Case Study: Challenges and Policy Solutions in Shanghai RAAS’ Cross-Border Equity Swap\n\n**Background:**\n\nOn March 30, 2020, Shanghai RAAS Blood Products Co., Ltd. (Shanghai RAAS, 002252.SZ) announced a share issuance to Grifols. S. A. (“Grifols”) for a 45% stake in Grifols Diagnostic Solutions Inc. (“GDS”). The shares were listed on March 31, with Grifols transferring 45% of “GDS” equity to Shanghai RAAS on March 13. This case study is sourced from Grifols’ official website.\n\n**![Chart showing transaction for Shanghai RAAS’ Cross-Border Equity Swap](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/china-foreign-ownership-transaction-diagram-1080A.png?x51944)Significant Challenges:**\n\n  1. Legal and Regulatory Hurdles: Shanghai RAAS had to prove it was exempt from ‘M&A Regulations’ due to its joint venture status. The process was further complicated by international legal frameworks and uncertainties about approval from the Ministry of Commerce.\n  2. Complex Approval Process: Stricter global scrutiny on foreign investments, plus multi-jurisdictional antitrust concerns, delayed the deal, risking shareholder value and complicating synergy realization.\n\n\n\nThe New Measure is designed to **optimize cross-border equity swaps** for Chinese firms and their international partners in the following three keyways:\n\n  1. Streamlined Approvals: The shift from pre-approval to post-investment reporting significantly cuts down the time needed to complete cross-border deals.\n  2. Optimized Financial Structure: By allowing cross-border equity swaps through share issuance, companies can reduce financial pressure and optimize tax planning. This is particularly beneficial for capital-intensive firms looking to expand globally.\n  3. Stronger Legal Protection: A clear legal framework based on “M&A Regulations” and the new “Strategic Investment Measures” provides better protection for cross-border transactions. The negative list for foreign investment entry further guides investors, minimizing risks.\n\n\n\n## 4) Seizing New Investment Opportunities in China’s Evolving Market\n\nThe New Measures unlock exciting new opportunities for global investors interested in China. Cross-border equity swaps and streamlined regulatory processes reduce entry barriers, allowing international companies to partner more easily with Chinese firms.\n\nThis policy creates a dynamic environment where both sides can benefit. Chinese companies gain access to global capital, technology, and expertise, while foreign investors tap into China’s massive market potential. The result? Long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships that fuel innovation and strengthen business ecosystems.\n\nWhether you’re looking to expand globally or collaborate on innovative technologies, the New Measures offer the chance to be part of China’s next phase of market growth and international transformation.\n\n![Evelyn Ding](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/evelyn-ding-500.jpg?x51944)\n\n**Author** :\n\nEvelyn Ding\n\n_Associate Consultant_\n\n![Johan Annell](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/johan-annell-500.jpg?x51944)\n\n**Author** :\n\nJohan Annell\n\n_Partner_\n\nRead more about our [advisory & strategy](https://arc-group.com/consulting/advisory-strategy/) expertise\n\n**References**\n\n  1.

The major catalyst behind the growth was the implementation of stricter bank regulations associated with the Basel III framework. These regulations, developed in response to the bank failures during the GFC, introduced higher capital requirements (Figure 1.2) for banks, effectively increasing banks’ cost to lend. The private credit market capitalized on this opportunity, as the lending model of private credit funds allows for better alignment between the duration of assets (loans) and the duration of liabilities (investor capital), thereby mitigating the liquidity risks that contributed to the financial crisis.\n\n![Graph showing Private Credit Market Size](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/private-credit-market-780.png?x51944)While many of the Basel III regulations are already in effect, the final rules, often referred to as the “Basel III endgame”, are scheduled to be implemented in mid-2025. The endgame rules, which have yet to be finalized (the current proposal was released in July 2023) will impose stricter capital and liquidity requirements on banks, further constraining their lending capacity and risk-taking abilities. Institutional investors and research analysts anticipate that these regulatory changes will cause banks to reprioritize their lending activities, potentially creating a large lending gap that private credit and alternative asset managers are well-positioned to fill.\n\n![Graph showing The Average Capital Requirements for Large U.S. Banks](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/private-credit-bank-capital-requirements-780.png?x51944)Over the next decade, lending sectors most likely to transition away from banks include asset-backed finance, infrastructure, commercial real estate and jumbo residential mortgages. In the U.S. alone, this transition could shift an estimated $6T of assets out of the banking sector(1), offering new investment opportunities and spurring additional growth in the private credit markets. In addition, BlackRock anticipates that regulatory pressures associated with the Basel III endgame could drive a significant increase in Synthetic Risk Transfers (SRTs), with projections suggesting 30% – 40% annual growth over the next two years(3). SRTs, which allow banks to transfer credit risk on loan portfolios to third-party investors without selling the underlying assets—and thus avoiding immediate losses—could be another growing market for private credit investors seeking steady income and potentially higher yields. With $500bn of estimated dry powder in the private capital markets(4), and intensified competition amongst capital providers, fund managers are likely to explore these new strategies to broaden their scope of investment and capitalize on the increased bank regulations.\n\n![Maxwell Mosbacher](https://arc-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/maxwell-mosbacher-500.jpg?x51944)\n\n**Author** :\n\nMaxwell Mosbacher\n\n_Senior Investment Analyst_\n\nRead more about our [advisory & strategy](https://arc-group.com/consulting/advisory-strategy/) expertise\n\n**References**\n\n  1.
