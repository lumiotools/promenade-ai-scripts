We cannot assure you that these expectations will occur, and our actual results may be significantly different. You\nshould not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontemplated in any forward-looking statements made by us are sometimes presented within the forward-looking statements themselves or\nare otherwise discussed in filings we make with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that is available on our website: http://www.hirequest.com or on the SEC’s website.
