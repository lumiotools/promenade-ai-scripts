The Fund’s share price\nclosed the period at $2.35 per share. Over the period, the discount to NAV widened from\n-20.52% to -24.19%. The total investment return, adjusted for distributions and the Rights\nOffering (as described below), was -29.76% based on NAV per share and -30.60% based\non market value per share. Notwithstanding the NAV dilution from the Rights Offering,\nthe underlying holdings performed well during the fiscal year period increasing 6.61%\npercent.\nThe Fund completed a non-transferable rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) on\nDecember 13, 2023, which resulted in the issuance of nine million (9,000,000) additional\nshares of common stock and allowed existing stockholders to add to their holdings at\na price of $2.31 per share. The Rights Offering resulted in NAV dilution per share of\n$1.6053. (See further information regarding the Rights Offering below).\nFollowing the Rights Offering, the Fund executed a cash tender offer (the “Tender\nOffer”) to purchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares of common stock at 97.5% of\nthe Fund’s NAV as of the close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (the\n“NASDAQ”) on March 19, 2024, the expiration date. As a result of the Tender Offer, the\nFund purchased 1,681,477 shares at a purchase price of $3.3833 per share and the number\nof shares of common stock outstanding decreased to 15,133,299. (See further information\nregarding the Tender Offer below).\nThe Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investment in companies that\nwe believe are poised to benefit from economic, political, structural, and technological\ndevelopments in the Caribbean Basin. Part of the investment strategy focuses on\ncompanies in the region that we believe would benefit from the resumption of U.S. trade\nwith Cuba. Since it is impossible to predict when the U.S. embargo will be lifted, we have\nconcentrated on investments that we believe can do well even if there is no political or\neconomic change with respect to Cuba.\nCaribbean Basin Update\nThe Caribbean Basin continues to be the leading economic region in the world according\nto data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which projected annual real\nGDP growth for the region of 9.7% for 2024 as of April. Such growth was above IMF’s\nestimate of 8.3% six months prior. Growth in the region is heavily skewed due to the rapid\ngrowth of Guyana, which is quickly becoming a major petro-state. Growth has normalized\nback to pre-COVID levels for many countries in the Caribbean Basin and is still above the\nglobal average when Guyana is excluded. Countries in the Caribbean Basin continue to see\nthe benefits of “nearshoring” due to their close proximity to the U.S. and in-development\nlong-term infrastructure projects. The U.S. economy has remained resilient, helping to pull\nthe Caribbean Basin’s economy forward.\n- 3 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nGuyana has been the biggest economic story in the Caribbean Basin with projected real\nGDP growth of 33.9% for 2024. Exxon Mobil announced plans in June 2024 for a new\nGuyana oil project estimated to lift the country’s production capacity from 645,000 to 1.5\nmillion barrels per day by 2029. Assuming government approval, this will be the seventh\noil project in Guyana led by Exxon Mobil. Current oil projects in Guyana are operating at\na break-even cost of less than $35 a barrel, which makes Guyana one of the most profitable\noil producers in the world.\nIn the Caribbean Basin overall, tourist arrivals are up 7.05% on a year-to-date basis when\ncompared to the same period last year. The Bahamas is the lone country in the region\nthat has seen a decline. Continued growth in arrivals has had ancillary benefits to other\nindustries that indirectly profit from growth in tourism and boosted Caribbean Basin\neconomies generally.\nAs we mentioned in prior reports, we expected a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba which\ncame to fruition in May 2024 when the U.S. eased restrictions on internet services and\nallowed independent private sector entrepreneurs in Cuba the ability to open U.S. bank\naccounts for transactions exempt from existing sanctions. These small- and medium-\nsized businesses (“pequena y mediana empresa” in Spanish) are colloquially referred\nto as “PyMEs”. We view the more than 11,000 PyMEs operating in Cuba as a welcome\ndevelopment. This small but important shift in U.S. policy is intended to add to the\ncapitalist model for Cuba and is a potential catalyst for change. Unfortunately, in mid-July\nthe Cuban government announced that it is banning its entrepreneurs from using U.S.\nbank accounts in a bid to keep dollars inside the island. The government is blaming local\nentrepreneurs that import goods from the U.S. for the country’s rampant inflation. It is yet\nto be determined how this situation will resolve. Although the Cuban government had been\nloosening socialist policies as a response to the failure of its economy since the pandemic,\nthis rejection of U.S. policy is a clear setback and not likely to help the Cuban economy,\nwhich by all accounts is reeling. According to the Cuban government, annual inflation\nis 30% and the country is expected to run a fiscal deficit of 18% of GDP for 2024. The\nregion’s largest economic driver is tourism, yet Cuba remains well below its pre-pandemic\nhigh for arrivals. In addition, Cuba’s business with its traditional trading partner Venezuela\nhas collapsed, causing the country to turn to China and Russia for assistance. While the\nopening of a U.S. relationship with Cuba remains politically stalled, we remain optimistic\nabout further shifts in stance from the combination of a faltering Cuban economy, a U.S.\ndesire to keep China and Russia from gaining additional economic leverage in the region,\nand opportunities for the U.S. economy to benefit from open trade with Cuba.\nPortfolio\nOur overweight positioning in financials and travel-related stocks were the main positive\ndrivers of performance over the fiscal year while industrials, consumer staples, and\ncommunication were the biggest detractors. With the Federal Reserve (“Fed”) pushing\npotential interest rate cuts to the second half of 2024, rate sensitive sectors and highly\nleveraged companies struggled over the fiscal year. The Fund’s holdings are valued at\nan average price-to-earnings ratio (“P/E”) of 14.49, well below the 23.94 P/E of the\nS&P 500®. Historically, interest rate cuts have resulted in P/E expansion for the Fund’s\n- 4 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nholdings. Additionally, we believe that a cut in rates will benefit our largest industry\nallocation, cruise lines, which issued debt during the pandemic at rates as high as 10.50%.\nThe biggest gainer over the Fund’s fiscal period was First BanCorp (FBP) which advanced\n55.50%. The U.S. banking scare in March 2023 had little effect on Puerto Rican banks\nas economic growth in the region remained robust and FBP did not suffer from the same\nindustry and demographic concentration of depositors that affected U.S. banks that\ncollapsed during that time. FBP has benefitted from the “higher for longer” rate cycle as\ntheir net interest margin remains robust at 4.58%. FBP also reported record revenues over\nthe last year while trading at an attractive P/E of 10.24 and raised its dividend 14.29%\nover the same period.\nPopular Inc. (BPOP), the largest of the three major Puerto Rican banks as measured by\nassets, was another top performer, rising 50.73%. Although BPOP underperformed its\npeers in 2023 with a revenue decline of -9%, it is now forecast to grow between 8%\nand 9% annually through 2026. BPOP also operates outside of Puerto Rico with 20% of\nrevenues from the mainland U.S. and other countries. BPOP raised its dividend by 12.72%\nover the last year and currently trades at an attractive P/E of 12.69.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) continued its robust rally, gaining 53.68% over the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2024, as cruise lines’ return to profitability led to a new all-time\nhigh in stock price. RCL is expected to improve on its 2023 record with estimated revenue\ngrowth of 18% for 2024. The company has outperformed its peers, including current\nFund portfolio holdings, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival\nCorporation (CCL) as RCL better managed its debt during the pandemic when cruises\nwere halted. RCL has seemingly been able to refinance earlier and at cheaper rates than its\npeers, resulting in higher margins. Operationally, RCL has also seen fuel efficiency gains\nand technology upgrades which have helped differentiate RCL from other cruise lines.\nWe continue to be bullish on the cruise industry as deleveraging and refinancing legacy\npandemic debt is expected to contribute to profit margins.\nThe worst performer over the Fund’s fiscal year was Fuego Enterprises Inc. (FUGI), which\nfell 83.33%. The OTC market-listed holding company has struggled for years to generate\nprofits in its various business endeavors related to Cuba. The holding is now a potential\ncandidate for tax-loss harvesting.\nSpanish Broadcasting System, Inc. (SBSAA) was another poor performer, down 72.00%.\nWe sold our holding in SBSAA as radio broadcasting remains on the downswing.\nCompetition from various other content delivery methods has taken up more market share.\nWe saw it as an opportunity to harvest tax losses in Q4 2023.\nAerSale Corporation (ASLE) struggled over the period after a series of disappointing\nearnings reports resulted in a decline of 52.93%. ASLE has seen volatile revenues quarter-\nover-quarter during the last few years as high interest rates have negatively affected aircraft\nsales and ongoing quality issues with Boeing planes have disrupted the industry. Although\nASLE appears to be turning a corner and returning to growth, we have been trimming the\nposition and taking losses to offset some sizable realized gains at the Fund level.\n- 5 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nOutlook\nOur outlook has not changed materially since our last commentary in the Fund’s\nshareholder report for the period ended December 31, 2023. The IMF still projects the\nCaribbean Basin to grow at the fastest pace of any region. U.S. consumers continue\nto spend on travel driving Caribbean economic growth and benefitting our holdings in\ncruise lines, hotels, and wellness. Caribbean Basin economies have been investing in\nmanufacturing and economic zones to take advantage of the trend in nearshoring, an\nunexpected result of the global pandemic.\nWe do not see growth in Guyana slowing down anytime soon, as investors continue to\nflock to the country. Exxon Mobil’s decision to propose another drilling project shows the\nlong-term investment they are making in the country and we believe regional companies\nservicing the oil and gas industry will outperform.\nThe recent presidential election in Mexico caused a sharp decline in equities and the peso\nbut, so far, the new President-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, has tried to temper expectations.\nHer predecessor’s proposed reforms, which he seeks to put into effect before his term is\nup, has seemingly spooked investors. We are closely monitoring potential reforms and\nhow they may affect our portfolio holdings.\nWith the Fed poised for interest rate cuts during the second half of 2024 and other central\nbanks already cutting, we believe the Caribbean Basin could outperform current growth\nprojections.\nOf note, we have expanded the implementation of our investment strategy to include\nselect investments in private issuers. While the Fund has historically invested in private\nassets, in recent years our investments have generally been limited to publicly-listed\nsecurities. In Q2 2024, however, the Fund participated in a private placement offering\nby Evermore Bank, a Ft. Lauderdale-based state chartered commercial bank supervised\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We believe that this investment presents\na compelling opportunity to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns for the Fund, as the\nbank’s management team has a history of successfully growing and exiting regional\nbanks. Going forward, we believe that investment opportunities in the Caribbean Basin\nwill continue to include both traditional publicly-listed securities and private transactions.\n- 6 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nLargest Allocations\nThe following tables present our largest investment and geographic allocations1 as of June\n30, 2024.\n% of Net % of Net\nGeographic Allocation Assets Largest Portfolio Positions Assets\nUSA 33.10% Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. 9.32%\nMexico 17.74% Royal Caribbean Cruises LTD. 8.24%\nPuerto Rico 12.75% MasTec, Inc. 7.61%\nPanama 10.55% NextEra Energy, Inc. 4.58%\nBermuda 9.32% Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. 4.24%\nLiberia 8.24% Banco Latinoamericano de\nNetherlands 7.49% Comercio Exterior, S.A. 4.24%\nBahamas 2.96% Evermore Bank 4.16%\nMoney Market 1.31% OFG Bancorp 4.08%\nCayman Islands 0.99% SBM Offshore N.V. 4.03%\nCuba 0.00% New Fortress Energy, Inc. 3.75%\nLiabilities in excess of\nother assets -4.45%\n100.00%\nQuarterly Distributions in Stock and Cash\nOn May 23, 2024, under the Fund’s managed distribution policy (the “Policy”), we\nannounced a quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.135375 per share for common\nstockholders to be paid July 15, 2024. The distribution was paid in cash or shares of\nour common stock at the election of stockholders. The distribution in stock or cash is\nconsistent with the Fund’s most recent prior quarterly distributions.\nWe believe that this cash and stock distribution will allow the Fund to strengthen its balance\nsheet and to be in position to capitalize on potential future investment opportunities.\nThe primary purpose of the Policy is to provide stockholders with a constant, but not\nguaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution (currently set at the annual rate of 15% of\nthe Fund’s net asset value as determined on December 19, 2023). The Board of Directors\nof the Fund recently amended the Policy to maintain the 15% annual rate of distribution,\nbut at quarterly, semi-annual or annual periods of distribution to be reviewed by the Board\neach quarter. The purpose of the modification is to allow the Fund to maintain its 15%\nannual distribution of NAV, but provide flexibility in determining the timing of those\ndistributions in order to account for required year-end regulatory distributions of capital\ngains necessary to maintain the Fund’s tax-free status. The Fund cannot predict what\neffect, if any, the Policy will have on the market price of its shares or whether such market\n1 Geographic allocation is determined by the issuer’s legal domicile.\n- 7 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nprice will reflect a greater or lesser discount to net asset value as compared to prior to the\nadoption of the Policy.\nRights Offering\nOn December 18, 2023, the Fund announced the final results of its non-transferable rights\noffering (the “Rights Offering”) that expired on December 13, 2023 (the “Expiration\nDate”). The Fund issued a total of 9,000,000 new shares of common stock at subscription\nprice per share of $2.31 as a result of the Rights Offering. The subscription price was\nestablished pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering and based on a formula equal\nto 92% of the volume-weighted average closing sales price of a share of common stock\non the NASDAQ on the Expiration Date of the Rights Offering and the four preceding\ntrading days. The Rights Offering was oversubscribed and the over-subscription requests\nexceeded the primary subscription shares available (i.e., 7,150,673 shares). The Board of\nDirectors of the Fund determined to issue an additional 25.86% of the number of shares\nissued in the primary subscription, or 1,849,327 additional shares, for a total issuance of\n9,000,000 new shares of common stock. The shares issued as part of the oversubscription\nprivilege of the Rights Offering were allocated pro rata among record date stockholders\nwho submitted over-subscription requests based on the number of rights originally\nissued to them by the Fund. Gross and net proceeds from the Rights Offering totaled\napproximately $20.8 million and $20.5 million, respectively.\nTender Offer\nOn March 25, 2024, the Fund announced the final results of its cash tender offer to\npurchase up to 10% of its outstanding common shares at 97.5% of the Fund’s NAV as of\nthe close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ on March 19, 2024, the expiration date (the\n“Tender Offer”). The Tender Offer was over-subscribed and the total number of shares\nproperly tendered was 12,349,477. Pursuant to the terms of the Tender Offer, the Fund\npurchased 13.615645% of shares properly tendered, or 1,681,477 shares, at a purchase\nprice of $3.3833, which decreased the total number of outstanding shares of common\nstock to 15,133,299.\n- 8 -\nInvestment Results (unaudited)\nAverage Annual Total Returns*\n(For the periods ended June 30, 2024)\nOne Year Five Year Ten Year\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund\nNet asset value per share -29.76% -3.70% -1.92%\nMarket value per share -30.60% -2.77% -1.76%\nS&P 500® Index** 24.56% 15.05% 12.86%\nMSCI Emerging Markets ex Asia Index *** 3.58% -0.97% -0.84%\nTotal annual operating expenses, as disclosed in the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund (the “Fund”) N-2 dated\nAugust 23, 2023, as amended October 24, 2023, were 3.45% of average daily net assets.

ORGANIZATION AND RELATED MATTERS\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”) is a non-diversified, closed-end\nmanagement investment company incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on\nMarch 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,\nand follows accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, “Financial\nServices - Investment Companies”. The Fund commenced investing activities in January\n1994. The Fund is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol\n“CUBA.”\nThe Fund’s investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund\npursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked securities of public\nand private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i) whose securities are traded\nprincipally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin Country or (ii) that have at least\n50% of the value of their assets in a Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least\n50% of their total revenue from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country (collectively,\n“Caribbean Basin Companies”). Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80%\nof its total assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin Countries. This\n80% policy may be changed without stockholder approval upon sixty days written notice\nto stockholders. The Fund’s investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed\nwithout the approval of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities.\nUnder the Fund’s organizational documents, its Officers and Directors are indemnified\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In\naddition, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts with its vendors\nand others that provide for general indemnifications. The Fund’s maximum exposure\nunder these arrangements is unknown as this would involve any future potential claims\nthat may be made against the Fund. However, based on experience, management expects\nthe risk of loss to be remote.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSecurity Valuation\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Fund uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with\nGAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the\nuse of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that\nobservable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Fund.\nUnobservable inputs reflect the Fund’s assumptions about the inputs market participants\n- 19 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels\nbased on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe Fund has the ability to access.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are\nobservable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs\nmay include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an active market,\nprices for similar instruments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,\nyield curves, default rates, and similar data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant\nobservable inputs are not available, representing the Fund’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset\nor liability, and that would be based on the best information available.\nThe availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from security to\nsecurity and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, the type of security, whether\nthe security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics\nparticular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that\nare less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires\nmore judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that\nmay be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be\nreasonably determined. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated\nvalues may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had\na ready market for the securities existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nby the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy\nwithin which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls, is determined based on the\nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available, the Fund’s own assumptions are set to reflect those\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThe Fund uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including\nperiods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many securities. This condition could cause a security to\nbe reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported on the\nNASDAQ National Market or Capital Market) are stated at the last reported sales price\non the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price); other securities traded\nin the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on\nthat date are stated at the last quoted bid price. Restricted securities and other securities\n- 20 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nfor which quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined, in\ngood faith, by the Advisor, as “valuation designee” under the oversight of the Board of\nDirectors.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of the Fund’s investments by the above\nfair value hierarchy levels as of June 30, 2024:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets (at fair value)\nCommon Stocks\nUSA $ 14,166,756 $ — $ 2,069,292 $ 16,236,048\nMexico 8,701,888 — — 8,701,888\nPuerto Rico 6,251,807 — — 6,251,807\nPanama 5,174,360 — — 5,174,360\nBermuda 4,569,860 — — 4,569,860\nLiberia 4,041,232 — — 4,041,232\nNetherlands 3,671,378 — — 3,671,378\nBahamas 1,453,541 — — 1,453,541\nCayman 484,394 — — 484,394\nBonds\nCuba — — — —\nMoney Market Funds 641,709 — — 641,709\nTotal Investments in\nsecurities $ 49,156,925 $ — $ 2,069,292 $ 51,226,217\nThe fair valued securities (Level 3) held in the Fund consisted of Cuban Electric Company,\nCeramica Carabobo, Evermore Bank, Fuego Enterprises, Inc., Siderurgica Venezolana\nSivensa S.A., Waterloo Investment Holdings Ltd. and Republic of Cuba 4.5% bond.\nThe following is a reconciliation of assets in which significant unobservable inputs (Level\n3) were used to determine fair value as of June 30, 2024:\nLevel 3\nBalance as of 6/30/23 $ 45,152\nPurchases 2,040,000\nChange in unrealized gain/(loss) (15,860)\nBalance as of 6/30/24 $ 2,069,292\nUnder procedures approved by the Board of Directors, the Advisor provides administration\nand oversight of the Fund’s valuation policies and procedures, which are reviewed at least\nannually by the Directors. Among other things, these procedures allow the Fund to utilize\nindependent pricing services, quotations from securities and financial instrument dealers\nand other market sources to determine fair value.\n- 21 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nThe Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of securities and other financial\ninstruments for which market prices are not readily available. Under these procedures, the\nAdvisor convenes on a regular and ad hoc basis to review such securities and considers\na number of factors, including valuation methodologies and significant unobservable\nvaluation inputs, when determining a fair value. The Advisor may employ a market-based\napproach which may use related or comparable assets or liabilities, recent transactions,\nmarket multiples, book values and other relevant information for the investment to\ndetermine the fair value of the investment. An income-based valuation approach may\nalso be used in which the anticipated future cash flows of the investment are discounted\nto calculate fair value. Discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any\nrestrictions on the disposition of investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of\nvaluations of such investments, the fair values may differ significantly from the values\nthat would have been used had an active market existed. The Advisor employs various\nmethods for calibrating these valuation approaches including a regular view of valuation\nmethodologies, key inputs and assumptions, transactional back-testing or disposition\nanalysis and reviews of any related market activity.\nThe Fund adopted policies to comply with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes\na regulatory framework for registered investment company fair valuation practices. The\nFund’s fair value policies and procedures and valuation practices were updated prior to\nthe rule’s required compliance date of September 8, 2022. Under Rule 2a-5, the Fund’s\nBoard of Directors designated the Advisor as the Fund’s “Valuation Designee” to make\nfair value determinations.\nIncome Recognition\nSecurity transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on securities sold\nare determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-\ndividend date or in the case of certain foreign securities, as soon as the Fund is notified,\nand interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on debt\nsecurities purchased are amortized over the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund’s\npractice to include the portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments\ndenominated in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on investments and foreign currency. Withholding on foreign taxes have been\nprovided for in accordance with the Fund’s understanding of the applicable country’s tax\nrules and rates.\nForeign Currency\nThe accounting records of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency\namounts and investments denominated in a foreign currency, if any, are translated into\nU.S. dollar amounts at current exchange rates on the valuation date. Purchases and sales\nof investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts\nat the exchange rate on the respective dates of such transactions.\n- 22 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nDeposits with Financial Institutions\nThe Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances with\nfinancial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.\nCounterparty Brokers\nIn the normal course of business, substantially all of the Fund’s money balances and\nsecurity positions are custodied with the Fund’s custodian, Fifth Third Bank N.A. The\nFund also transacts with other brokers. The Fund is subject to credit risk to the extent any\nbroker with which it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its\nbehalf. The Fund’s management monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does\nnot anticipate any losses from these counterparties.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Fund’s policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to\ndistribute substantially all of its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,\nthe Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no federal income\nor excise tax provision is required.\nThe Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.\nDistributions to Stockholders\nUnder a managed distribution plan, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 the Fund paid\ndistributions to stockholders payable in quarterly installments at an annual rate set at 15%\nof the Fund’s December 19, 2023 NAV. The distributions may be sourced from income,\npaid-in capital, and/or capital gains, if any. To the extent that sufficient investment income\nis not available, the Fund may distribute paid-in capital and/or capital gains, if any, in order\nto maintain its managed distribution level. The Board suspended the managed distribution\nplan in August 2023 and reinstated the managed distribution plan effective November 22,\n2023.\nIn November 2023, the Board of Directors of the Fund amended the Policy to maintain\nthe 15% annual rate of distribution, but at quarterly, semi-annual or annual periods of\ndistribution to be reviewed by the Board each quarter. The purpose of the modification is\nto allow the Fund to maintain its 15% annual distribution of NAV, but provide flexibility\nin determining the timing of those distributions in order to account for required year-end\n- 23 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nregulatory distributions of capital gains necessary to maintain the Fund’s tax-free status.\nThe Fund cannot predict what effect, if any, the Policy will have on the market price of\nits shares or whether such market price will reflect a greater or lesser discount to net asset\nvalue as compared to prior to the adoption of the Policy.\nDistributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and capital\ngain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may\ndiffer from GAAP. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, a distribution from return of\ncapital of $0.135375 per share was declared on December 29, 2023, March 27, 2024, and\n$0.01544 on June 3, 2024, respectively, and a distribution from long-term capital gains of\n$0.11993 per share was declared to shareholders of record on June 3, 2024.\nDue to the timing of dividend distributions and the differences in accounting for income\nand realized gains and losses for financial statement and federal income tax purposes, the\nfiscal year in which the amounts are distributed may differ from the year in which the\nincome and realized gains and losses are recorded by the Fund.\nDerivatives Risk Management Program\nThe Fund adopted policies and procedures to comply with the SEC’s new Rule 18f-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, which limits the amount of derivatives a fund can enter into, eliminates\nthe asset segregation framework previously used by funds to comply with Section 18\nof the 1940 Act, treats derivatives as senior securities and requires funds whose use of\nderivatives is more than a limited specified exposure amount to establish and maintain\na comprehensive derivatives risk management program and when applicable, appoint a\nderivatives risk manager. The Fund adopted a derivatives risk management program to\nimplement and comply with Rule 18f-4 prior to the SEC’s required compliance date of\nAugust 19, 2022 in the event it is required to rely on Rule 18f-4.\nNOTE 3. RESTRICTED SECURITIES OWNED\nInvestments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of Cuba\nbonds, $140,000 purchased for $52,850 on February 15, 1995 and $25,000 purchased for\n$10,188 on April 27, 1995, that are currently segregated and restricted from transfer. The\nbonds were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and had been trading in\ndefault since 1960. A “regulatory halt” on trading was imposed by the NYSE in July 1995\nand trading in the bonds was suspended as of December 28, 2006. The NYSE has stated\nthat following the suspension of trading, application will be made to the Securities and\nExchange Commission to delist the issue. As of June 30, 2024 the position was valued at\n$0 under procedures approved by the Board of Directors.\nInvestments in securities also include 700 shares of Cuban Electric Company, 482 shares\npurchased for $4,005 on September 30, 2005 and 218 shares purchased for $1,812 on\nSeptember 30, 2005, which are currently segregated and restricted from transfer. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the position was valued at $0 under procedures approved by the Board of\nDirectors.\n- 24 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nInvestments in securities also include 170,000 shares of Evermore Bank purchased for\n$2,040,000 on June 21, 2024, which are currently segregated and restricted from transfer.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the position was valued at $2,040,000 under procedures approved by\nthe Board of Directors.\nNOTE 4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND OTHER SERVICE\nPROVIDERS\nTransactions with Affiliates\nHERZFELD / CUBA (the “Advisor”), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc.,\nis the Fund’s investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual rate of 1.45%\nof the Fund’s average daily net assets. Total fees for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024,\namounted to $642,194, before the waiver described below. Mr. Thomas J. Herzfeld is the\nowner of the Advisor.\nThe Advisor has agreed to voluntarily waive its management fee by ten basis points, in\nsupport of the Fund’s initiative to attempt to reduce the stock price discount to NAV.\nEffective November 22, 2023, the Advisor has further agreed to voluntarily waive its\nmanagement fee on the Fund’s net assets in excess of $30 million by an additional ten\n(10) basis points. Accordingly, the Advisor’s management fee after the voluntary waivers\nis (i) 1.35% of the Fund’s assets up to and including $30 million and (ii) 1.25% of the\nFund’s assets in excess of $30 million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Advisor\nwaived fees in the amount of $56,987. At June 30, 2024, the Fund owed the Advisor\n$52,730.\nTMorgan Advisers, LLC (“TMA”) has been engaged by the Advisor to provide, among\nother things, certain compliance and operational support services with respect to the\nFund, including the services of Mr. Thomas K.

Compensation\nrelated to services provided to the Advisor by Mr. Morgan are paid directly by the Advisor\nin the form of wages. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the total compliance and\noperational support services fees paid or payable by the Fund to TMA amounted to\n$71,245.\nOther Service Providers\nUnder a Master Services Agreement between Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC (“Ultimus”)\nand the Fund, Ultimus is responsible for fund administration, including generally\nmanaging the administrative affairs of the Fund, and supervising the preparation of reports\nto stockholders, reports to and filings with the SEC and materials for meetings of the\nBoard. Ultimus is also responsible for fund accounting, including calculating the net asset\nvalue per share and maintaining the financial books and records of the Fund. Ultimus also\nserves as the transfer agent and provides shareholder services to the Fund. The Master\nServices Agreement permits Ultimus to subcontract for the provision of services it has\ncontracted for under the Master Services Agreement, and Ultimus has subcontracted\ntransfer agency services to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC. Ultimus is entitled to receive\n- 25 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\na fee in accordance with the agreement and was paid $73,250 for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2024.\nThe Fund has entered into an agreement with Fifth Third Bank N.A. to serve as the\ncustodian for the Fund’s assets.\nNOTE 5. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, purchases and sales of investment securities\nwere $24,474,906 and $11,037,359, respectively.\nNOTE 6. INCOME TAX INFORMATION\nThe cost basis of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower than the cost\nbasis for income tax purposes by $221,342 due to wash sale adjustments, passive foreign\ninvestment companies and book-to-tax adjustments to partnership investment. As of June\n30, 2024, gross unrealized gains were $16,098,100 and gross unrealized losses were\n$(2,185,333) for income tax purposes.\nPermanent differences accounted for during the year ended June 30, 2024, result from\ndifferences between book and tax accounting for the characterization of foreign currency\nlosses, partnership adjustments, and the reclassification of the Fund’s net investment loss\nfor tax purposes. Such amounts have been reclassified as follows:\nTotal\nDistributable Additional Paid\nEarnings in Capital\nYear ended June 30, 2024 $ 354,093 $ (354,093)\nPost-October capital losses incurred after October 31 and within the taxable year are\ndeemed to arise on the first business day of the Fund’s next taxable year. As of June 30,\n2024, the Fund had Post-October capital losses of $38,270.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Fund had $257,898 of qualified late-year ordinary losses, which\nare deferred until fiscal year 2024 for tax purposes. Net late-year losses incurred after\nDecember 31 within the taxable year are deemed to arise on the first day of the Fund’s\nnext taxable year.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Fund is required to determine whether a tax position is\nmore likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority,\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical\nmerits of the position. The Fund files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction\nand may file income tax returns in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. Generally\nthe Fund is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for\nyears before June 30, 2020. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount\nof benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement.\n- 26 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nDe-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Fund recording a tax\nliability that reduces ending net assets.\nThe Fund’s policy would be to recognize accrued interest expense to unrecognized tax\nbenefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. There were none for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tax character of distributions paid to stockholders during the years ended June 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2023 were as follows: ordinary income of $0 and $0, respectively,\nlong-term capital gains of $1,896,602 and $714,706, respectively, and a return of capital\nof $4,479,318 and $3,893,734, respectively.\nNOTE 7. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS\nShares of Common Stock\nThe Fund has 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 15,814,233 issued and\noutstanding as of June 30, 2024. Transactions in common stock for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2024, were as follows:\nShares at beginning of year 7,150,673\nProceeds from rights offering 9,000,000\nShares issued in revinvestment of dividends and distributions 1,345,037\nShares repurchased (1,681,477)\nShares at end of year 15,814,233\n2024 Shelf Registration\nThe Fund has incurred approximately $85,000 of offering costs in association with a shelf\nregistration, which will be recorded as deferred offering costs and will be amortized over\nthe life of the shelf registration if and when new shares are issued. As of June 30, 2024,\n$1,180 of the total cost are categorized as deferred offering costs (shelf) on the Statement\nof Assets and Liabilities. As of June 30, 2024, $0 has been amortized.\n2024 Tender Offer\nThe Fund’s Board of Directors determined to commence an offer to purchase up to 10%,\nor 1,681,477 shares of the Fund’s issued and outstanding common stock. The offer was a\ncash offer at a price equal to 97.5% of the Fund’s net asset value per share (“NAV”) as of\nthe close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 19, 2024. As a\nresult of the tender offer 1,681,477 shares were purchased.\n2023 Rights Offering\nOn December 19, 2023, the Fund issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock in connection\nwith a rights offering. Stockholders of record November 3, 2023 were issued one non-\ntransferable right for every share owned on that date. The rights entitled the stockholders\nto purchase one new share of common stock for every one right held. In addition, the\n- 27 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nFund had the discretion to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to\nsubscription by up to 200% of the shares offered, or up to an additional 14,301,346 shares\nof common stock.\nThe subscription price was equal to 92% of the average volume-weighted closing sales\nprice per share of the Fund’s common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on December\n13, 2023, and the four preceding trading days. The final subscription price was $2.31 per\nshare. The offering was oversubscribed and the oversubscription requests exceeded the\nprimary shares available. The Fund issued an additional 25.86% of the number of shares\nissued in the primary subscription, or 1,849,327 additional shares, for a total issuance of\n9,000,000 new shares of common stock. Net proceeds to the Fund were $20,507,085, after\ndeducting rights offering costs of $282,916. The net asset value of the Fund’s common\nshares was decreased by approximately $1.60 per share, as a result of the share issuance.\n2022 Tender Offer\nThe Fund’s Board of Directors determined to commence an offer to purchase up to 5%,\nor 338,382 Shares of the Fund’s issued and outstanding Common Stock. The offer was a\ncash offer at a price equal to 97.5% of the Fund’s net asset value per share (“NAV”) as of\nthe close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on November 8, 2022. As a\nresult of Tender Offer 338,382 shares were purchased.\n2021 Shelf Registration\nThe Fund incurred approximately $67,342 of offering costs in association with a shelf\nregistration, which was recorded as deferred offering costs and was amortized over the\nlife of the shelf registration as new shares were issued. At the expiration of the offering,\n$67,342 of offering costs had been amortized.\nNOTE 8. INVESTMENT RISKS\nForeign Securities Risk\nSecurities traded in foreign markets have often (though not always) performed differently from\nsecurities traded in the United States. However, such investments often involve special risks\nnot present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. In\nparticular, the Fund is subject to the risk that because there may be fewer investors on foreign\nexchanges and a smaller number of securities traded each day, it may be more difficult for the\nFund to buy and sell securities on those exchanges. In addition, prices of foreign securities may\ngo up and down more than prices of securities traded in the United States.\nForeign Economy Risk\nThe economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy\nof the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product,\nreinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. Certain foreign\neconomies may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more\nvulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a\nparticular country or countries, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers\n- 28 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nand other protectionist or retaliatory measures. Investments in foreign markets may also\nbe adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls,\nnationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of\npunitive taxes. In addition, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain\nindustries. Any of these actions could severely affect securities prices or impair the Fund’s\nability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund’s assets or income back\ninto the United States, or otherwise adversely affect the Fund’s operations.\nOther potential foreign market risks include foreign exchange controls, difficulties in\npricing securities, defaults on foreign government securities, difficulties in enforcing legal\njudgments in foreign courts and political and social instability. Legal remedies available\nto investors in certain foreign countries may be less extensive than those available to\ninvestors in the United States.\nCurrency Risk\nSecurities and other instruments in which the Fund invests may be denominated or quoted\nin currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may\naffect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Because the Fund’s assets are primarily invested in\nsecurities of Caribbean Basin Companies, and because some portion of revenues and income\nmay be received in foreign currencies while Fund distributions will be made in dollars, the\ndollar equivalent of the Fund’s net assets and distributions would be adversely affected by\nreductions in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the dollar. For this reason, changes\nin foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Generally,\nwhen the U.S. Dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. Dollars. Conversely, when\nthe U.S. Dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency gains value because the currency is worth more U.S. Dollars. This risk, generally\nknown as “currency risk,” means that a strong U.S. Dollar may reduce returns for U.S.\ninvestors while a weak U.S. Dollar may increase those returns. The Fund is managed with\nthe assumption that most of its stockholders hold their assets in U.S. Dollars. As a result, and\nbecause distributions are made in U.S. Dollars, other non-U.S. investors will be adversely\naffected by reductions in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to their home currency.\nGeographic Concentration Risk\nThe Fund may invest from time to time a substantial amount of assets in issuers located in\na single country or a limited number of countries. If the Fund concentrates its investments\nin this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in those\ncountries will have a significant impact on its investment performance. The Fund’s\ninvestment performance may also be more volatile if it concentrates its investments in\ncertain countries, especially emerging market countries.\nManaged Distribution Risk\nUnder the managed distribution plan, the Fund makes quarterly, semi-annual or annual\ndistributions to stockholders as determined by the Board of Directors at a rate set once a\n- 29 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (continued)\nyear that is a percentage of the Fund’s NAV at December 19, 2023, or such other date as\nthe Board of Directors may set from time to time, that may be sourced from income, paid-\nin capital, and/or capital gains, if any. To the extent that sufficient investment income is not\navailable, the Fund may distribute paid-in capital and/or capital gains, if any, in order to\nmaintain its managed distribution level. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s\ninvestment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of\nthe managed distribution plan. A return of capital occurs when some or all of the money\nthat stockholders invested in the Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not\nreflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or\n“income.” Any such returns of capital will decrease the Fund’s total assets and, therefore,\ncould have the effect of increasing the Fund’s expense ratio. In addition, in order to make\nsuch distributions, the Fund may have to sell a portion of its investment portfolio at a\nless than opportune time. There is a risk that amendment or termination of the managed\ndistribution plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s shares.\nMarket Risk\nThe value of the securities in which the Fund invests may be affected by political,\nregulatory, economic and social developments, and developments that impact specific\neconomic sectors, industries or segments of the market. In addition, turbulence in\nfinancial markets and reduced liquidity in equity, credit and/or fixed income markets may\nnegatively affect many issuers, which could adversely affect the Fund. Global economies\nand financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, and conditions and\nevents in one country, region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a\ndifferent country, region or financial market. These risks may be magnified if certain\nevents or developments adversely interrupt the global supply chain; in these and other\ncircumstances, such risks might affect companies world-wide. Recent examples include\npandemic risks related to coronavirus outbreaks and aggressive measures taken world-\nwide in response by governments, and by businesses, including changes to operations and\nreducing staff.\nThe impact of pandemic risks may last for an extended period of time and result in a\nsubstantial economic downturn. Any such impact could adversely affect the Fund’s\nperformance.\nNOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has evaluated the impact of subsequent events on the Fund, through the date\nthe financial statements were issued, and has determined that there were no subsequent\nevents that required disclosure in the financial statements.\n- 30 -\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and\nThe Board of Directors of\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The Herzfeld\nCaribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”), including the schedule of investments, as of June 30,\n2024, the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes\nin net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, financial highlights for each\nof the five years in the period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Fund as of June 30, 2024, the results of its operations\nfor the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period\nthen ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Fund’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We have served as the Fund’s auditor since 2016.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nFund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Fund’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express\nno such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included\nconfirmation of securities owned as of June 30, 2024 by correspondence with the custodian.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nTAIT, WELLER & BAKER LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nAugust 26, 2024\n- 31 -\nDirectors and Officers of the Fund (unaudited)\nNumber\nof\nTerm of Portfolios\nOffice Principal In\nand Occupation(s) Complex Other\nName Position(s) Length During Overseen Directorships\nAddress Held with of Time Past By Held by\nand Age Fund Served 5 Years Director Director\nInterested Directors\nThomas J.

The Fund’s Form N-PORT reports are available on the SEC’s\nEDGAR database at www.sec.gov and on the Fund’s website at www.herzfeld.com/cuba.\nProxy Voting Policies and Procedures (unaudited)\nInformation regarding how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during\nthe most recent twelve-month period ended June 30, and a description of the Fund’s\npolicies and procedures used to determine how to vote proxies relating to its portfolio\nsecurities is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund at 800-TJH-FUND\n(800-854-3866), or by accessing the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nShareholder Information (unaudited)\nThe following information in this annual report is a summary of certain information about\nthe Fund and changes that occurred since the effective date of its registration statement on\nForm N-2 on July 1, 2024. (the “prior disclosure date”). This information may not reflect\nall of the changes that have occurred since you purchased the Fund.\nINVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES\nThere have been no changes in the Fund’s investment objective or principal investment\npolicies since the prior disclosure date.\nInvestment Objective\nThe Fund’s investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. This objective\nis fundamental and may not be changed without the prior approval of the holders of a\nmajority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities.\nPrincipal Investment Policies\nThe Fund pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked securities\nof public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i) whose securities are\ntraded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin country, (ii) that have at least\n50% of the value of their assets in a Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least\n50% of their total revenue from operations in a Caribbean Basin country (collectively\nreferred to herein as “Caribbean Basin Companies”). Current income through receipt of\ninterest or dividends from the Fund’s securities is incidental to the Fund’s efforts to attain\nits investment objective. The Fund invests in Caribbean Basin Companies that are likely,\nin the opinion of the Advisor, to benefit from political, legal and economic developments\nin the Caribbean Basin Countries. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at\n- 36 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nleast 80% of its total assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin\nCompanies, including U.S.-based companies which engage in substantial trade with, and\nderive substantial revenue from, operations in the Caribbean Basin Countries. Total assets\ninclude the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes. The Fund may invest more\nthan 25% of its total assets in the securities of U.S.-based companies. U.S. law currently\nprohibits the Fund from investing its assets in securities of companies that benefit from\nfree trade with Cuba (“companies strategically linked to Cuba”). Companies strategically\nlinked to Cuba may include a company that benefits from free trade with Cuba but does\nnot meet the definition of Caribbean Basin Company set forth above. If permitted to\nmake such investments upon a lifting or easing of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba or\npursuant to regulations promulgated by a department or agency of the U.S. Government,\nthe Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in equity and equity-linked securities of non-\nCaribbean Basin Companies strategically linked to Cuba.\nEquity securities of public and private companies that may be purchased by the Fund\nconsist of common stock, convertible and non-convertible preferred stock (whether voting\nor non-voting), debt with equity warrants and unattached warrants. The Fund may also\ninvest in the shares of other registered investment companies, some of which may be\nCaribbean Basin Companies.\nThe Fund may invest in securities that lack an established secondary trading market or\notherwise are considered illiquid. Liquidity of a security relates to the ability to dispose\neasily of the security and the price to be obtained upon disposition of the security, which\nmay be less than would be obtained for a comparable more liquid security. Illiquid\nsecurities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments. Investment\nof the Fund’s assets in illiquid securities may restrict the ability of the Fund to dispose\nof its investments in a timely fashion and for a fair price as well as its ability to take\nadvantage of market opportunities. The risks associated with illiquidity will be particularly\nacute where the Fund’s operations require cash, such as when the Fund redeems shares\nor pays a distribution and could result in the Fund borrowing to meet short-term cash\nrequirements or incurring capital losses on the sale of illiquid investments.\nThe Fund may invest in securities that are not registered under the Securities Act\n(“restricted securities”). Restricted securities may be sold in private placement transactions\nbetween issuers and their purchasers and may be neither listed on an exchange nor traded\nin other established markets. In many cases, privately placed securities may not be\nfreely transferable under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or due to contractual\nrestrictions on resale. As a result of the absence of a public trading market, privately placed\nsecurities may be less liquid and more difficult to value than publicly traded securities.\nTo the extent that privately placed securities may be resold in privately negotiated\ntransactions, the prices realized from the sales, due to illiquidity, could be less than those\noriginally paid by the Fund or less than their fair market value. In addition, issuers whose\nsecurities are not publicly traded may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor\nprotection requirements that may be applicable if their securities were publicly traded.\nIf any privately placed securities held by the Fund are required to be registered under\nthe securities laws of one or more jurisdictions before being resold, the Fund may be\n- 37 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nrequired to bear the expenses of registration. Certain of the Fund’s investments in private\nplacements may consist of direct investments and may include investments in smaller, less\nseasoned issuers, which may involve greater risks. These issuers may have limited product\nlines, markets or financial resources, or they may be dependent on a limited management\ngroup. In making investments in such securities, the Fund may obtain access to material\nnonpublic information, which may restrict the Fund’s ability to conduct portfolio\ntransactions in such securities.\nTemporary Defensive Positions\nThe Fund may vary its investment policy for temporary defensive purposes when, in the\nopinion of the Advisor, such a change is warranted due to changes in the securities markets\nin which the Fund may invest or other economic or political conditions affecting such\nmarkets. For temporary defensive purposes, the Fund may reduce its position in equity\nand equity-linked securities and invest in U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Dollar denominated\nbank time deposits and certificates of deposit rated high quality or better by any nationally\nrecognized statistical rating service or, if unrated, of equivalent investment quality as\ndetermined by the Advisor. The banks whose obligations may be purchased by the Fund\nwill include any member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. The Fund does not seek\nto achieve its stated investment objective when it has assumed a temporary defensive\nposition.\nSpecial Leverage Considerations\nHedging Transactions\nThe Fund may employ one or more of the hedging techniques described below, primarily\nto protect against a decrease in the U.S. Dollar equivalent value of its portfolio securities\ndenominated in foreign currencies or in the payments thereon that may result from an\nadverse change in foreign currency exchange rates. Conditions in the securities, futures,\noptions and foreign currency markets will continue to determine whether and under what\ncircumstances the Fund will employ any of the techniques or strategies described below.\nThe Fund’s ability to pursue certain of these strategies may be limited by applicable\nregulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Federal tax\nrequirements applicable to regulated investment companies.\nPursuant to applicable law and subject to certain restrictions, the Fund may effect hedging\ntransactions on a variety of U.S. and foreign exchanges. The operations of U.S. exchanges\nare considered to be subject to more stringent regulation and supervision than those of\ncertain non-U.S. exchanges.\nIf any percentage limitations applicable to the transactions described below are exceeded\ndue to market fluctuations after an initial investment, the Fund may not enter into\nnew transactions of the type to which the exceeded limitation applies until the total of\nthe Fund’s commitments with respect to such transactions falls within the applicable\nlimitation.\n- 38 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nThe Advisor believes that in some circumstances the purchase and sale of forward foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts (“forward contracts”) may help offset declines in the U.S.\nDollar equivalent value of the Fund’s assets denominated in foreign currencies and in the\nincome available for distribution to the Fund’s stockholders that would result from adverse\nchanges in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and such foreign currencies. For\nexample, the U.S. Dollar equivalent value of the principal of and rate of return on, the\nFund’s foreign denominated securities will decline if the exchange rate fluctuates between\nthe U.S. Dollar and such foreign currency whereby the U.S. Dollar increases in value. Such\na decline could be partially or completely offset by an increase in the value of a foreign\ncurrency forward contract. The Fund may purchase forward contracts involving either the\ncurrencies in which certain of its portfolio securities are denominated or, in cross-hedging\ntransactions, other currencies, changes in the value of which correlate closely with the\nchanges in the value of the currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated.\nThe Fund will enter into such cross-hedging transactions (i) only with respect to currencies\nwhose foreign exchange rate changes historically have shown a high degree of correlation\nto changes in the foreign exchange rate of the currency in which the hedged asset is\ndenominated (a “correlated currency”) and (ii) only when the Advisor believes that the\nincrease in correlation risk is offset by the lower transaction costs and increased liquidity\navailable for financial instruments denominated in the correlated currency.\nThe Fund may enter into forward contracts or maintain a net exposure on such contracts\nonly if (i) the consummation of the contracts would not obligate the Fund to deliver an\namount of foreign currency in excess of the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities or other\nassets denominated in that currency or (ii) the Fund maintains cash, U.S. Government\nsecurities or other liquid, high-grade debt securities in a segregated account in an amount\nnot less than the value of the Fund’s total assets committed to the consummation of the\ncontract.\nAlthough the use of forward contracts may protect the Fund against declines in the U.S.\nDollar equivalent value of the Fund’s assets, such use may reduce the possible gain from\nadvantageous changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against particular currencies in\nwhich the Fund’s assets are denominated. Moreover, the use of forward contracts will not\neliminate fluctuations in the underlying U.S. Dollar equivalent value of the prices of, or\nrates of return on, the assets held in the Fund’s portfolio.\nThe use of forward contracts subjects the Fund to certain risks. The matching of the\nincrease in value of a forward contract and the decline in the U.S. Dollar equivalent value\nof the asset that is the subject of the hedge generally is not precise. The success of any\nof these techniques depends on the ability of the Advisor to predict correctly movements\nin foreign currency exchange rates. If the Advisor incorrectly predicts the direction of\nsuch movements or if unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates occur,\nthe Fund’s performance may be poorer than if it had not entered into such contracts. The\ncost to the Fund of engaging in forward contracts varies with such factors as the foreign\ncurrency involved, the length of the contract period and the prevailing market conditions,\nincluding general market expectations as to the direction of the movement of various\n- 39 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nforeign currencies against the U.S. Dollar. Consequently, because the Fund may not\nalways be able to enter into forward contracts at attractive prices, it may be limited in its\nability to use such contracts to hedge its assets or for other risk management purposes. In\naddition, there can be no assurance that historical correlations between the movements of\ncertain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar will continue.\nOptions on Foreign Currencies\nThe Fund may purchase and write put and call options on foreign currencies to protect\nagainst a decline in the U.S. Dollar equivalent value of its portfolio securities or payments\ndue thereon or a rise in the U.S. Dollar equivalent cost of securities that it intends to\npurchase. A foreign currency put option grants the holder the right, but not the obligation,\nat a future date to sell a specified amount of a foreign currency to its counterparty at a\npredetermined price. A foreign currency call option grants the holder the right, but not\nthe obligation, to purchase at a future date a specified amount of a foreign currency at a\npredetermined price.\nAs in the case of other types of options, the benefit to the Fund from purchases of foreign\ncurrency options will be reduced by the amount of the premium and related transaction\ncosts. In addition, if currency exchange rates do not move in the direction or to the extent\nanticipated, the Fund could sustain losses on transactions in foreign currency options\nwhich would require it to forego a portion or all of the benefits of advantageous changes\nin such rates.\nAny options on foreign currencies written by the Fund will be covered. A call option is\n“covered” if the Fund owns the underlying foreign currency covered by the call or has\nan absolute and immediate right to acquire that foreign currency without additional cash\nconsideration (or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its\ncustodian) upon conversion or exchange of other foreign currency held in its portfolio. A\ncall option is also covered if the Fund has a call on the same foreign currency and in the\nsame principal amount as the call written, so long as the exercise price of the call held\n(i) is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or (ii) is greater than the\nexercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the Fund in cash, U.S.\ngovernment securities or other liquid, high-grade debt securities in a segregated account\nwith its custodian. The Fund covers any put option it writes on foreign currencies by\nholding with its custodian, in a segregated account, cash, U.S. government securities or\nother liquid, high-grade debt securities in an amount equal to the option price.\nThe Fund may not purchase or write options on foreign currencies if, as a result, the Fund\nwill have more than 20% of the value of its total assets invested in, or at risk with respect\nto, such options.\nFutures Contracts\nThe Fund may enter into contracts for the purchase or sale for future delivery (“futures\ncontracts”) of foreign stock or bond indices or other financial indices that the Advisor\nand the Manager determine are appropriate to hedge the risks associated with changes in\ninterest rates or general fluctuations in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities.\n- 40 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nPursuant to the regulations of the CFTC, and subject to certain restrictions, the Fund\nmay purchase or sell futures contracts that are traded on U.S. exchanges that have been\ndesignated as contract markets by the CFTC. The Fund may also generally purchase or\nsell futures contracts that are subject to the rules of any foreign board of trade (“foreign\nfutures contracts”). The Fund may not, however, trade a foreign futures contract based on\na foreign stock index unless the contract has been approved by the CFTC for trading by\nU.S. persons.\nThe Fund is required to make a margin deposit in cash or government securities with a\nbroker or custodian to initiate and maintain positions in futures contracts. Minimal initial\nmargin requirements are established by the futures exchange and brokers may establish\nmargin requirements which are higher than the exchange requirements. After a futures\ncontract position is opened, the value of the contract is marked to market daily. If the\nfutures contract price changes to the extent that the margin on deposit does not satisfy\nmargin requirements, payment of additional “variation” margin is required. Conversely,\nreduction in the contract value may reduce the required margin resulting in a repayment\nof excess margin to the Fund. Variation margin payments are made to and from the futures\nbroker for as long as the contract remains open.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund will generally only purchase or sell futures\ncontracts (including foreign currency exchange contracts), or options thereon, for bona\nfide hedging purposes, as defined in applicable CFTC regulations. If the Fund purchases\nor sells such futures contracts (including foreign currency exchange contracts), or options\nthereon for purposes other than bona fide hedging transactions, in accordance with CFTC\nregulations, the Fund will in no event purchase or sell futures contracts if immediately\nthereafter the sum of the amounts of initial margin deposits and premiums on the Fund’s\nexisting futures contracts would exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Fund’s total\nassets. The Advisor reserves the right to comply with such different standards as may\nbe established by the CFTC with respect to the purchase or sale of futures contracts and\nforeign futures contracts.\nOptions on Securities and Options on Indices\nThe Fund may purchase or sell exchange traded or over-the-counter put and call options\non its portfolio securities.\nThe Fund may write covered put and call options on portfolio securities to generate\nadditional revenue for the Fund and, in certain circumstances, as a partial hedge (to the\nextent of the premium received less transaction costs) against a decline in the value of\nportfolio securities and in circumstances in which the Advisor anticipates that the price\nof the underlying securities will not increase above or fall below (in the case of put\noptions) the exercise price of the option by an amount greater than the premium received\n(less transaction costs incurred) by the Fund. Although writing put and call options may\ngenerate additional revenue for the Fund, such revenue is incidental to the Fund’s efforts to\nachieve its investment objective. The Fund’s strategy limits potential capital appreciation\nin the portfolio securities subject to the options.\n- 41 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nThe Fund may write only covered options. “Covered” means that, so long as the Fund is\nobligated as the writer of a call option, it will own either the underlying securities or an\noption to purchase the same underlying securities having an expiration date not earlier\nthan the expiration date of the covered option and an exercise price equal to or less than\nthe exercise price of the covered option, or establish or maintain with its custodian for the\nterm of the option a segregated account consisting of cash, U.S. government securities or\nother liquid, high-grade debt obligations having a value equal to the fluctuating market\nvalue of the option securities. The Fund will continue to cover any put option it writes by\nmaintaining a segregated account with its custodian as described above.\nThe Fund may not purchase or write options on securities or options on indices if, as a\nresult, the Fund will have more than 5% of the value of its total assets invested in, or at\nrisk with respect to, either such class of options.\nThe Fund’s successful use of options and futures depends on the ability of the Advisor\nto predict the direction of the market, and is subject to various additional risks. The\ninvestment techniques and skills required to use options and futures successfully are\ndifferent from those required to select equity and equity-linked securities for investment.\nThe correlation between movements in the price of the option or future and the price of\nthe securities being hedged is imperfect and the risk from imperfect correlation increases,\nwith respect to stock index futures and options, as the composition of the Fund’s portfolio\ndiverges from the composition of the index underlying such index futures and options. In\naddition, the ability of the Fund to close out a futures or options position depends on a\nliquid secondary market. There is no assurance that liquid secondary markets will exist\nfor any particular option or futures contract at any particular time. The securities the Fund\nis required to maintain in segregated accounts in connection with its hedging transactions\nare not available for investment in accordance with the Fund’s investment objective of\nlong-term capital appreciation.\nOn U.S. exchanges, once an option contract has been accepted for clearance, the exchange\nclearing organization is substituted as both buyer and seller of the contract, thereby\nguaranteeing the financial integrity of the option contract. Options on securities and on\nindices traded on certain non-U.S. exchanges may not be so guaranteed by a clearing\norganization. The absence of such a role for a clearing organization on such a non-U.S.\nexchange would expose the Fund to the credit risk of its counterparty. If its counterparty\nwere to default on its obligations, the Fund could lose the expected benefit of the\ntransaction.\nRepurchase Agreements\nWhen cash may be available to the Fund for only a few days, the Fund may invest such\ncash in repurchase agreements until such time as it otherwise may be invested or used for\npayments of obligations of the Fund. In these transactions, the Fund purchases a security\nand simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller at an agreed-upon price\nand date. The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon market rate\nof interest, which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the security purchased.\nThe obligation of the seller to pay the agreed-upon price is secured by the value of the\n- 42 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nunderlying securities, which is maintained at the Fund’s custodian at a value at least equal\nto the resale price. The Advisor monitors the adequacy of the collateral on a daily basis\nto ensure that the collateral always equals or exceeds the repurchase price. Repurchase\nagreements could involve certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the other\nparty, including possible delays or restrictions upon the Fund’s ability to dispose of the\nunderlying securities. The Fund could suffer a loss to the extent proceeds from the sale of\ncollateral were less than the value of the contract.\nThe Fund may not invest its assets in repurchase agreements with a maturity of more\nthan seven days, but the collateral securities may have maturities of more than one year.\nThe Fund has not adopted an investment restriction limiting the value of its total assets\nnot invested in accordance with its fundamental investment policy that may be invested\nin repurchase agreements. To minimize the risks of such investments, however, the Fund\nenters into repurchase agreements only with its custodian, other member banks of the\nFederal Reserve System having assets in excess of $1 billion, and recognized primary U.S.\nGovernment securities dealers determined by the Advisor, subject to review by the board\nof the Fund, to be creditworthy.\nRepurchase agreements do not constitute cash, cash items, receivables or government\nsecurities for purposes of the federal tax diversification test. Therefore, the Fund limits its\ninvestments in repurchase agreements with any one bank, dealer, broker or other entity in\norder to comply with the federal tax diversification test.\nDebt Securities\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in non-equity linked debt securities including\nforeign denominated corporate debt and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments,\ntheir agencies or instrumentalities, or other government-related entities. Debt securities,\nsuch as bonds, involve credit risk. This is the risk that the issuer will not make timely\npayments of principal and interest. The degree of credit risk depends on the issuer’s\nfinancial condition and on the terms of the debt securities. Changes in an issuer’s credit\nrating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value\nof a Fund’s investment in that issuer. All debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.\nThis is the risk that the value of the security may fall when interest rates rise. If interest\nrates move sharply in a manner not anticipated by the Advisor, a Fund’s investments in\ndebt securities could be adversely affected and the Fund could lose money. In general, the\nmarket price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response\nto changes in interest rates than will the market price of shorter-term debt securities.\nIn addition, debt securities issued in foreign currency denominations will be subject to\ncurrency risk.\nInvestment in sovereign debt can involve a high degree of risk. The governmental\nentity that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may not be able or willing to repay\nthe principal and/or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt. A\ngovernmental entity’s willingness or ability to repay principal and interest due in a timely\nmanner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its\nforeign reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment\n- 43 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nis due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole, the\ngovernmental entity’s policy towards the International Monetary Fund and the political\nconstraints to which a governmental entity may be subject. Governmental entities may\nalso be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, multilateral\nagencies and others abroad to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt.\nThe commitment on the part of these governments, agencies and others to make such\ndisbursements may be conditioned on the implementation of economic reforms and/or\neconomic performance and the timely service of such debtor’s obligations. Failure to\nimplement such reforms, achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal\nor interest when due may result in the cancellation of such third parties’ commitments to\nlend funds to the governmental entity, which may further impair such debtor’s ability or\nwillingness to timely service its debts. Consequently, governmental entities may default\non their sovereign debt. Holders of sovereign debt may be requested to participate in the\nrescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to governmental entities. In the event\nof a default by a governmental entity, there may be few or no effective legal remedies for\ncollecting on such debt.\nFundamental Investment Restrictions\nThe following investment restrictions of the Fund are fundamental and may not be\nchanged without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding\nvoting securities. A “majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities” means the\nlesser of (i) 67% of the shares represented at a meeting at which more than 50% of the\noutstanding shares are present in person or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of\nthe outstanding shares. The Fund may not:\n1. Issue senior securities, pledge its assets or borrow money in excess of 10% of the\ntotal value of its assets (including the amount borrowed) less its liabilities (not\nincluding its borrowings) and other than for temporary or emergency purposes\nor for the clearance of transactions, except that the Fund may borrow from a\nbank or other entity in a privately arranged transaction for repurchases and/\nor tenders for its shares, if after such borrowing there is asset coverage of at\nleast 300% as defined in the 1940 Act, and may pledge its assets to secure any\npermitted borrowing. For the purposes of this investment restriction, the Fund\nwill not purchase additional portfolio securities while borrowings exceed 5% of\nthe Fund’s total assets; and collateral arrangements with respect to the writing\nof options or the purchase or sale of futures contracts are not deemed a pledge\nof assets or the issuance of a senior security.\n2. Underwrite securities of other issuers, except insofar as the Fund may be\ndeemed an underwriter under the Securities Act in selling portfolio securities.\n3. Purchase or sell real estate or real estate mortgage loans, except that the Fund\nmay purchase and sell securities secured by real estate or interests therein.\n4. Buy or sell commodities, commodity contracts or futures contracts (other than as\ndescribed under “Investment Objective and Policies—Hedging Transactions”).\n- 44 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\n5. Make loans, except through purchasing debt obligations, lending portfolio\nsecurities and entering into repurchase agreements consistent with the Fund’s\ninvestment objective and policies.\n6. Invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in a particular industry.\nThis restriction does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the\nU.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, but will apply to foreign\ngovernment obligations until such time as the SEC permits their exclusion.\nNon-Fundamental Investment Restrictions\nThe Fund has adopted certain investment restrictions that may not be changed without\nthe prior approval of a majority of the board. Under its non-fundamental investment\nrestrictions, the Fund may not:\n1. Purchase any securities (other than obligations of the U.S. government, its\nagencies or instrumentalities or securities of other regulated investment\ncompanies) if as a result more than 25% of the Fund’s total assets would be\ninvested in securities of any single issuer.\n2. Purchase more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer.\n3. Make short sales of securities or maintain a short position in any security.\n4. Purchase securities on margin, except such short-term credits as may be\nnecessary or routine for the clearance or settlement of transactions, and except\nthat the Fund may engage in transactions as described under “Investment\nObjective and Policies-Hedging Transactions” and post margin in connection\ntherewith consistent with its investment policies.\n5. Buy, sell or write put or call options (other than as described under “Special\nLeverage Considerations - Hedging Transactions”).\nAs an additional non-fundamental investment restriction, the Fund will not guarantee the\nobligations of third parties.\nRISK FACTORS AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nInvesting in the Fund’s common stock provides an ownership interest in the Fund.\nInvesting in any investment company security involves significant risk, including the risk\nthat a stockholder may receive little or no return on the stockholder’s investment or that\nthe stockholder may lose part or all of the stockholder’s investment. The risks below are\nnot the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us\nor not presently deemed material by us may also impair our operations and performance.\nIf any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the net asset value and\ntrading price, if any, of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of\nyour investment. Therefore, before investing, stockholders should consider carefully the\nfollowing risks that are assumed when investing in the Fund.\n- 45 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nDiscount from Net Asset Value\nShares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is less than the value\nof the net assets attributable to those shares. The possibility that the Fund’s shares will\ntrade at a discount from NAV is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund’s\nNAV will decrease. The risk of purchasing shares of a closed-end fund that might trade at\na discount or unsustainable premium is more pronounced for investors who wish to sell\ntheir shares in a relatively short period of time after purchasing them because, for those\ninvestors, realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent\nupon the existence of a premium or discount than upon portfolio performance. The Fund’s\nshares are not redeemable at the request of stockholders. The Fund may repurchase its\nshares in the open market or in private transactions, although it has no present intention to\ndo so. Stockholders desiring liquidity may, subject to applicable securities laws, trade their\nshares in the Fund on the NASDAQ Capital Market or other markets on which such shares\nmay trade at the then current market value, which may differ from the then current NAV.\nThe NAV of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The NAV and liquidity of the\nmarket for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors,\nsome of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating\nperformance. These factors include:\n● changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;\n● changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines;\n● distributions that exceed our net investment income and net income as reported\naccording to generally accepted account principles in the United States;\n● changes in earnings or variations in operating results;\n● changes in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments;\n● departure of our Advisor or certain of their respective key personnel; and\n● general economic trends and other external factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The investments we make in\naccordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than\nalternative investment options and includes volatility or loss of principal. Our investments\nin portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive and, therefore, an\ninvestment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.\nRisks of Investing in Caribbean Basin Countries\nThe economies of Caribbean Basin Countries have in the past experienced considerable\ndifficulties, including high inflation rates, high interest rates, and high unemployment.\nThe emergence of the economies and securities markets of the Caribbean Basin Countries\nwill require continued economic and fiscal discipline that has been lacking at times in the\npast, as well as stable political and social conditions. International economic conditions,\n- 46 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nparticularly those in the United States, as well as world prices for oil and other commodities\nmay also influence the development of the economies of the Caribbean Basin Countries.\nThe currencies of foreign countries (including those foreign countries in the definition\nof the Caribbean Basin) are subject to fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar and foreign\ncountries (including those foreign countries in the definition of the Caribbean Basin) have\nhad to make major adjustments in their currencies from time to time. Also many Caribbean\nBasin Countries have experienced substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates\nof inflation for many years. For companies that keep accounting records in the local\ncurrency, inflation accounting rules in some Caribbean Basin Countries require, for both\ntax and accounting purposes, that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the company’s\nbalance sheet in order to express items in terms of currency of constant purchasing power.\nInflation accounting may indirectly generate losses or profits for certain Caribbean Basin\nCompanies. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had, and could, in the\nfuture, have very negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain\nCaribbean Basin Countries.\nIn addition, governments of many Caribbean Basin Countries have exercised and continue\nto exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Governmental\nactions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Caribbean\nBasin Countries, which could affect the companies in which the Fund invests and,\ntherefore, the value of Fund shares. Investments in foreign markets may be adversely\naffected by governmental actions such as the imposition of punitive taxes. In addition,\nthe governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on\nforeign investing in their capital markets or in certain industries. Substantial limitations\nmay exist in certain countries with respect to the Fund’s ability to repatriate investment\nincome, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities. The Fund could be adversely affected\nby delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of\ncapital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. Any of\nthese actions could severely affect security prices, impair the Fund’s ability to purchase or\nsell foreign securities or transfer the Fund’s assets or income back into the United States,\nor otherwise adversely affect the Fund’s operations.\nCertain Caribbean Basin Countries have entered into regional trade agreements that are\ndesigned to, among other things, reduce barriers between countries, increase competition\namong companies and reduce government subsidies in certain industries. No assurance\ncan be given that these changes will be successful in the long term, or that these changes\nwill result in the economic stability intended. There is a possibility that these trade\narrangements will not be fully implemented, or will be partially or completely unwound.\nIt is also possible that a significant participant could choose to abandon a trade agreement,\nwhich could diminish its credibility and influence. Any of these occurrences could have\nadverse effects on the markets of both participating and non-participating countries,\nincluding sharp appreciation or depreciation of participants’ national currencies and a\nsignificant increase in exchange rate volatility, a resurgence in economic protectionism, an\nundermining of confidence in the Caribbean Basin markets, an undermining of Caribbean\nBasin economic stability, the collapse or slowdown of the drive towards economic unity,\n- 47 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nand/or reversion of the attempts to lower government debt and inflation rates that were\nintroduced in anticipation of such trade agreements. Such developments could have an\nadverse impact on the Fund’s investments in the Caribbean Basin generally or in specific\ncountries participating in such trade agreements.\nThe Caribbean Basin has experienced natural disasters, including hurricanes, droughts and\nfloods, which have caused substantial damage to parts of the Caribbean Basin and have\nharmed the region’s economies. The possibility exists that another natural disaster could\nmaterially disrupt and adversely affect the economies of Caribbean Basin Countries. In\naddition, companies and industries in which the Fund invests may experience substantial\ndisruptions in operations as a result of any such natural disasters.\nThe Caribbean Basin is vulnerable to environmental disasters, for instance the BP Oil\nspill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 had a widespread economic impact on the region. The\npotential and impact of such occurrences in the future is impossible to gauge.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a material disruption of the economies\nof many Caribbean Basin Countries, due to their dependence on tourism and cruise lines.\nOther Caribbean Basin market risks include foreign exchange controls, difficulties in\npricing securities, defaults on sovereign debt, difficulties in enforcing contracts, difficulties\nin enforcing favorable legal judgments in local courts and political and social instability.\nLegal remedies available to investors in certain Caribbean Basin countries may be less\nextensive than those available to investors in the United States or other foreign countries.\nGeographic Concentration Risk\nThe Fund may invest from time to time a substantial amount of its assets in issuers\nlocated in a single country or a limited number of countries. If the Fund concentrates\nits investments in this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social\nconditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance.\nThe Fund’s investment performance may also be more volatile if it concentrates its\ninvestments in certain countries, especially emerging market countries.\nForeign Securities Risk\nSecurities traded in foreign markets have often (though not always) performed differently\nfrom securities traded in the United States. However, such investments often involve\nspecial risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund\nwill lose money. In particular, the Fund is subject to the risk that because there may be\nfewer investors on foreign exchanges and a smaller number of securities traded each day,\nit may be more difficult for the Fund to buy and sell securities on those exchanges. In\naddition, prices of foreign securities may go up and down more than prices of securities\ntraded in the United States.\nForeign Economy Risk\nThe economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy\nof the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product,\n- 48 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nreinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. Certain foreign\neconomies may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more\nvulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a\nparticular country or countries, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers\nand other protectionist or retaliatory measures. Investments in foreign markets may also\nbe adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls,\nnationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of\npunitive taxes. In addition, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain\nindustries. Any of these actions could severely affect securities prices or impair the Fund’s\nability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund’s assets or income back\ninto the United States, or otherwise adversely affect the Fund’s operations.\nOther potential foreign market risks include foreign exchange controls, difficulties in\npricing securities, defaults on foreign government securities, difficulties in enforcing legal\njudgments in foreign courts and political and social instability. Legal remedies available\nto investors in certain foreign countries may be less extensive than those available to\ninvestors in the United States.\nCurrency Risk\nSecurities and other instruments in which the Fund invests may be denominated or quoted\nin currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may\naffect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Because the Fund’s assets are primarily invested\nin securities of Caribbean Basin Companies, and because some portion of revenues and\nincome may be received in foreign currencies while Fund distributions will be made in\ndollars, the dollar equivalent of the Fund’s net assets and distributions would be adversely\naffected by reductions in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the dollar. For\nthis reason, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s\nportfolio. Generally, when the U.S. Dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a\nsecurity denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S.\nDollars. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency, a\nsecurity denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is worth more U.S.\nDollars. This risk, generally known as “currency risk,” means that a strong U.S. Dollar\nmay reduce returns for U.S. investors while a weak U.S. Dollar may increase those returns.\nThe Fund is managed with the assumption that most of its stockholders hold their assets\nin U.S. Dollars. As a result, and because distributions are made in U.S. Dollars, other\nnon-U.S. investors will be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the U.S. Dollar\nrelative to their home currency.\nGovernmental Supervision and Regulation/Accounting Standards\nForeign issuers are generally not bound by uniform accounting, auditing, and financial\nreporting requirements and standards of practice comparable to those applicable to U.S.\nissuers. Some of the securities held by the Fund may not be registered with the SEC nor\nmay the issuers be subject to the SEC’s reporting requirements. Thus, there may be less\navailable information concerning foreign issuers of securities held by the Fund than is\n- 49 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nnot be available, and it may be difficult to secure dividends and information regarding\ncorporate actions on a timely basis. In general, there is less overall governmental\nsupervision and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers, and listed companies than\nin the United States. OTC markets tend to be less regulated than stock exchange markets\nand, in certain countries, may be totally unregulated. Regulatory enforcement may be\ninfluenced by economic or political concerns, and investors may have difficulty enforcing\ntheir legal rights in foreign countries.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government has from time to time imposed restrictions, through\npenalties and otherwise, on foreign investments by U.S. investors, including current\nprohibitions on U.S. investment in Cuba. Investments in securities of Cuban companies, if\npermitted by U.S. law, may be subject to certain political and economic risks in addition\nto the risks associated with investment in the securities of issuers domiciled in other\nforeign countries. The risks include (i) less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the\nsmall current size of the markets for such securities and the currently low or nonexistent\nvolume of trading, which result in a lack of liquidity and in greater price volatility; (iii)\ncertain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including\nrestrictions on investment in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests;\n(iv) the absence of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment or\nallowing for judicial redress for injury to private property; (v) the absence of a capital\nmarket structure or market-oriented economy; and (vi) the possibility that recent favorable\neconomic developments may be slowed or reversed by unanticipated political or social\nevents in such countries. Investments in securities of Cuban companies, if and when the\nFund is permitted to invest in such securities, will be speculative and involve risks not\nusually associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed market\neconomies. See “Emerging Markets Risk” below.\nSome foreign securities or nations impose restrictions on transfer within the United\nStates or to U.S. persons. Although securities subject to such transfer restrictions may be\nmarketable abroad, they may be less liquid than foreign securities of the same class that\nare not subject to such restrictions.\nAccounting standards in other countries are not necessarily the same as in the United\nStates. If the accounting standards in another country do not require as much detail as\nU.S. accounting standards, it may be harder for the Advisor to completely and accurately\ndetermine a company’s financial condition. In instances where the financial statements\nof an issuer are not deemed to reflect accurately the financial situation of the issuer, the\nAdvisor will take appropriate steps to evaluate the proposed investment, which may\ninclude on-site inspection of the issuer (including Cuba, if U.S. restrictions on travel\nto Cuba are lifted), interviews with its management and consultation with accountants,\nbankers and other specialists.\nCertain Risks of Holding Fund Assets Outside the United States\nThe Fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities\ndepositories. Some foreign banks and securities depositories may be recently organized\nor new to the foreign custody business. In addition, there may be limited or no regulatory\n- 50 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\noversight of their operations. Also, the laws of certain countries limit the Fund’s ability\nto recover its assets if a foreign bank, depository or issuer of a security, or any of their\nagents, goes bankrupt. In addition, it is often more expensive for the Fund to buy, sell and\nhold securities in certain foreign markets than in the United States. The increased expense\nof investing in foreign markets reduces the amount the Fund can earn on its investments\nand typically results in a higher operating expense ratio for the Fund than for investment\ncompanies invested only in the United States.\nSettlement Risk\nSettlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets differ significantly from\nthose in the United States. Foreign settlement and clearance procedures and trade regulations\nalso may involve certain risks (such as delays in payment for or delivery of securities) not\ntypically associated with the settlement of U.S. investments. Communications between\nthe United States and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of\ndelayed settlements or losses of security certificates in markets that still rely on physical\nsettlement. At times, settlements in certain foreign countries have not kept pace with the\nnumber of securities transactions. These problems may make it difficult for the Fund to\ncarry out transactions. If the Fund cannot settle or is delayed in settling a purchase of\nsecurities, it may miss attractive investment opportunities and certain of its assets may be\nuninvested with no return earned thereon for some period. If the Fund cannot settle or is\ndelayed in settling a sale of securities, it may lose money if the value of the security then\ndeclines or, if it has contracted to sell the security to another party, the Fund could be liable\nfor any losses incurred. Dividends or interest on, or proceeds from the sale of, foreign\nsecurities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.\nStock Dividend Risk\nWe have declared, and may in the future declare, taxable dividends that are payable to\nour stockholders in cash or in shares of our common stock at the election of stockholders\nsubject to a limitation on the total amount of cash that may be distributed. In addition, if\na significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to\npay taxes owed on distributions, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of\nour stock.\nEmerging Markets Risk\nThe risks of foreign investments are usually much greater for emerging markets.\nInvestments in emerging markets, including many Caribbean Basin Countries, may\nbe considered speculative. Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets\nbecause they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Since these markets\nare often small, they may be more likely to suffer sharp and frequent price changes or\nlong-term price depression because of adverse publicity, investor perceptions or the\nactions of a few large investors. Many emerging markets have histories of political\ninstability and abrupt changes in policies. As a result, their governments are more likely\nto take actions that are hostile or detrimental to private enterprise or foreign investment\nthan those of more developed countries. Certain emerging markets may also face other\n- 51 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nsignificant internal or external risks, including the risk of war, and civil unrest. In addition,\ngovernments in many emerging market countries participate to a significant degree in their\neconomies and securities markets, which may impair investment and economic growth.\nInvestments in the securities of issuers domiciled in countries with emerging capital\nmarkets involve certain additional risks that do not generally apply to investments in\nsecurities of issuers in more developed capital markets, such as (i) low or non-existent\ntrading volume, resulting in a lack of liquidity and increased volatility in prices for such\nsecurities, as compared to securities of comparable issuers in more developed capital\nmarkets; (ii) uncertain national policies and social, political and economic instability,\nincreasing the potential for expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation, high rates of\ninflation or unfavorable diplomatic developments; (iii) possible fluctuations in exchange\nrates, differing legal systems and the existence or possible imposition of exchange\ncontrols, custodial restrictions or other foreign or U.S. governmental laws or restrictions\napplicable to such investments; (iv) national policies that may limit the Fund’s investment\nopportunities such as restrictions on investment in issuers or industries deemed sensitive\nto national interests; and (v) the lack or relatively early development of legal structures\ngoverning private and foreign investments and private property. In addition to withholding\ntaxes on investment income, some countries with emerging markets may impose\ndifferential capital gains taxes on foreign investors.\nEmerging capital markets are developing in a dynamic political and economic environment\nbrought about by events over recent years that have reshaped political boundaries and\ntraditional ideologies. In such a dynamic environment, there can be no assurance that any\nor all of these capital markets will continue to present viable investment opportunities for\nthe Fund. In the past, governments of such nations have expropriated substantial amounts\nof private property, and most claims of the property owners have never been fully settled.\nThere is no assurance that such expropriations will not reoccur. In such an event, it is\npossible that the Fund could lose the entire value of its investments in the affected market.\nAlso, there may be less publicly available information about issuers in emerging markets\nthan would be available about issuers in more developed capital markets, and such\nissuers may not be subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards\nand requirements comparable to those to which U.S. companies are subject. In certain\ncountries with emerging capital markets, reporting standards vary widely. As a result,\ntraditional investment measurements used in the United States, such as price/ earnings\nratios, may not be applicable. Emerging market securities may be substantially less liquid\nand more volatile than those of mature markets, and company shares may be held by a\nlimited number of persons. This may adversely affect the timing and pricing of the Fund’s\nacquisition or disposal of securities. Communications between the United States and\nemerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements\nor losses of security certificates.\nPractices in relation to settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve\nhigher risks than those in developed markets, in part because the Fund may need to use\nbrokers and counterparties that are less well capitalized, and custody and registration of\nassets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence, undue\n- 52 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\ninfluence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some\nemerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration\nbeing completely lost. The Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such registration\nproblems and may have no successful claim for compensation.\nRisks Related to Equity and Equity-Linked Securities\nCommon Stock Risks\nThe Fund may invest in common stock. Common stock is issued by a company principally\nto raise cash for business purposes and represents an equity or ownership interest in the\nissuing company. Common stockholders are typically entitled to vote on important matters\nof the issuing company, including the selection of directors, and may receive dividends on\ntheir holdings. The Fund participates in the success or failure of any company in which\nit holds common stock. In the event a company is liquidated or declares bankruptcy, the\nclaims of bondholders, other debt holders, owners of preferred stock and general creditors\ntake precedence over the claims of those who own common stock.\nThe prices of common stocks change in response to many factors including the historical\nand prospective earnings of the issuing company, the value of its assets, general economic\nconditions, interest rates, investor perceptions and market liquidity.\nPreferred Stock Risks\nThe Fund may invest in preferred stock. Preferred stock, unlike common stock, often\noffers a specified dividend rate payable from a company’s earnings. Preferred stock\nalso generally has a preference over common stock on the distribution of a company’s\nassets in the event the company is liquidated or declares bankruptcy; however, the rights\nof preferred stockholders on the distribution of a company’s assets in the event of a\nliquidation or bankruptcy are generally subordinate to the rights of the company’s debt\nholders and general creditors. If interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks\nmay be less attractive, causing the price of preferred stocks to decline.\nSome fixed rate preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions that provide\nfor the stock to be retired or redeemed on a predetermined schedule, as well as call/\nredemption provisions prior to maturity, which can limit the benefit of any decline in\ninterest rates that might positively affect the price of preferred stocks. Preferred stock\ndividends may be “cumulative,” requiring all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to\nbe paid before dividends are paid on the issuer’s common stock. Preferred stock may be\n“participating,” which means that it may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated\ndividend in certain cases.\nConvertible Securities Risks\nThe Fund may invest in convertible securities. Convertible securities are generally bonds,\ndebentures, notes, preferred stocks or other securities or investments that may be converted\nor exchanged (by the holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock\n(or cash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio or predetermined\n- 53 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nprice (the conversion price). A convertible security is designed to provide current income\nand also the potential for capital appreciation through the conversion feature, which\nenables the holder to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying common\nstock. A convertible security may be called for redemption or conversion by the issuer\nafter a particular date and under certain circumstances (including a specified price)\nestablished upon issue. If a convertible security held by the Fund is called for redemption\nor conversion, the Fund could be required to tender it for redemption, convert it into the\nunderlying common stock, or sell it to a third party, which may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. Convertible securities have general\ncharacteristics similar to both debt and equity securities.\nA convertible security generally entitles the holder to receive interest paid or accrued\nuntil the convertible security matures or is redeemed, converted or exchanged. Before\nconversion, convertible securities have characteristics similar to non-convertible debt\nobligations and are designed to provide for a stable stream of income with generally higher\nyields than common stocks. However, there can be no assurance of current income because\nthe issuers of the convertible securities may default on their obligations. Convertible\nsecurities rank senior to common stock in a corporation’s capital structure and, therefore,\ngenerally entail less risk than the corporation’s common stock. Convertible securities are\nsubordinate in rank to any senior debt obligations of the issuer, and, therefore, an issuer’s\nconvertible securities entail more risk than its debt obligations. Moreover, convertible\nsecurities are often rated below investment grade or not rated because they fall below debt\nobligations and just above common stock in order of preference or priority on an issuer’s\nbalance sheet. To the extent that the Fund invests in convertible securities with credit\nratings below investment grade, such securities may have a higher likelihood of default,\nalthough this may be somewhat offset by the convertibility feature.\nConvertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible\ndebt securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation.\nThe common stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a different entity\nthan the issuer of the convertible securities.\nThe value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of non-convertible\nsecurities of comparable issuers and by the value of the underlying common stock. The\nvalue of a convertible security viewed without regard to its conversion feature (i.e.,\nstrictly on the basis of its yield) is sometimes referred to as its “investment value.” The\ninvestment value of the convertible security typically will fluctuate based on the credit\nquality of the issuer and will fluctuate inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates.\nHowever, at the same time, the convertible security will be influenced by its “conversion\nvalue,” which is the market value of the underlying common stock that would be obtained\nif the convertible security were converted. Conversion value fluctuates directly with the\nprice of the underlying common stock, and will therefore be subject to risks relating to\nthe activities of the issuer and general market and economic conditions. Depending upon\nthe relationship of the conversion price to the market value of the underlying security, a\nconvertible security may trade more like an equity security than a debt instrument.\n- 54 -\nShareholder Information (unaudited) (continued)\nThe Fund will invest in convertible securities based primarily on the characteristics of\nthe equity security into which it converts, and without regard to the credit rating of the\nconvertible security (even if the credit rating is below investment grade). To the extent that\nthe Fund invests in convertible securities with credit ratings below investment grade, such\nsecurities may have a higher likelihood of default, although this may be somewhat offset\nby the convertibility feature.\nIf, because of a low price of the common stock, the conversion value is substantially\nbelow the investment value of the convertible security, the price of the convertible security\nis governed principally by its investment value. Generally, if the conversion value of\na convertible security increases to a point that approximates or exceeds its investment\nvalue, the value of the security will be principally influenced by its conversion value. A\nconvertible security will sell at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors\nplace value on the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding an income-\nproducing security.\nRisks of Other Equity-Linked Securities\nEquity-linked securities are instruments whose value is based upon the value of one or\nmore underlying equity securities, a reference rate or an index. Equity-linked securities\ncome in many forms and may include features, among others, such as the following: (i)\nmay be issued by the issuer of the underlying equity security or by a company other than\nthe one to which the instrument is linked (usually an investment bank), (ii) may convert\ninto equity securities, such as common stock, within a stated period from the issue date or\nmay be redeemed for cash or some combination of cash and the linked security at a value\nbased upon the value of the underlying equity security within a stated period from the issue\ndate, (iii) may have various conversion features prior to maturity at the option of the holder\nor the issuer or both, (iv) may limit the appreciation value with caps or collars of the value\nof the underlying equity security, and (v) may have fixed, variable or no interest payments\nduring the life of the security which reflect the actual or a structured return relative to the\nunderlying dividends of the linked equity security.\nInvestments in equity-linked securities may subject the Fund to additional risks not\nordinarily associated with investments in other equity securities. Because equity-linked\nsecurities are sometimes issued by a third party other than the issuer of the linked security,\nthe Fund is subject to risks if the underlying equity security, reference rate or index\nunderperforms, or if the issuer defaults on the payment of the dividend or the common\nstock at maturity. In addition, the trading market for particular equity-linked securities\nmay be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a particular security when\nnecessary and reduced liquidity in the secondary market for any such securities may make\nit more difficult to obtain market quotations for valuing the Fund’s portfolio.\n- 55 -\nFee and Expense Table (unaudited)\nFee Table (as of June 30, 2024)\nStockholder Transaction Expenses:\nSales load (as a percentage of the offering price) —%*\nOffering expenses borne by us —%*\nDividend reinvestment plan fees None\nTotal stockholder transaction expenses (as a percentage of offering\nprice)\nAnnual Expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common shares):\nManagement Fees (1) 1.45%\nOther expenses (estimated) (2) 1.76%\nAcquired Fund Fees and Expenses (3) 0.00%\nTotal Annual Expenses (estimated) (3) 3.21%\n* The actual amounts in connection with any offering of securities by the Fund will be set forth\nin a supplement to the Fund’s prospectus if applicable.\n(1) During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Advisor voluntarily waived its management\nfee by 10 basis points (from 1.45% to 1.35%) in support of the Fund’s initiative to attempt to\nreduce the stock price discount to NAV. In November 2023, TJHA agreed to extended the fee\nwaiver through June 30, 2024 and has further agreed to waive its management fee on the Fund’s\nnet assets in excess of $30 million by an additional ten (10) basis points. Accordingly, effective\nNovember 2023 the Advisor’s management fee after the voluntary waiver is (i) 1.35% of the\nFund’s assets up to and including $30 million and (ii) 1.25% of the Fund’s assets in excess of\n$30 million.\n(2) “Other Expenses” do not include expenses of the Fund incurred in connection with any offer\nof the Fund’s securities. However, these expenses will be borne by the holders of the shares of\ncommon stock of the Fund and result in a reduction in the net asset value, or “NAV”, of the\nshares of common stock.\n(3) “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are less than 0.005%.

We\ncannot predict whether our common stock will trade at a premium or discount to NAV in\nthe future. The board of directors approved a self-tender offer policy (the “Self-Tender\nPolicy”) beginning in 2020. Under the Self-Tender Policy, as amended effective August 20,\n2021, the Fund has undertaken to conduct a tender offer by the end of October following\neach fiscal year-end (June 30th) of 5% of outstanding shares of the Fund at 97.5% of NAV\nif the average discount was greater than 10% for the fiscal year just ended. In the exercise\nof its business judgement, in determining whether to undertake a tender offer, the Board\nof will generally consider, to the extent known at the time, the timing and procedures\nassociated with a proposed tender offer, including when and how the purchase price will be\ndetermined, and how the Fund will fund the tender offer. The Board may consider all other\ninformation that it deems relevant in the exercise of its fiduciary duty. These tender offers\nmay be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without any notice. The\nBoard may in the future determine to suspend the tender offer policy in light of prevailing\neconomic conditions, heightened volatility in the financial markets, or other factors that\nthe Board determines to be relevant in the exercise of its fiduciary duty.\nAdditional information about the table above is included in the Fund’s Prospectus.\nSee also, “Price Range of Common Stock” and “Description of Common Stock\n- Share Repurchases and Tender Offers” in the Fund’s prospectus for additional\ninformation.\n- 58 -\nSection 19(a) Notices (unaudited)\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.’s (CUBA) (the “Fund”) amounts and sources of\ndistributions reported are estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

If the net asset value per Common Stock\nexceeds the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date\nfor a Distribution, the Agent (or a broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall endeavor\nto apply the amount of such Distribution on each Participant’s Common Stock to\npurchase Common Stock on the open market. In the event of a market discount on\nthe payment date, the Agent will have 30 days after the dividend payment date (the\n“last purchase date”) to invest the dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market\npurchases. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all\nCommon Stock purchased by the Agent as Agent shall be the price per Common\nStock allocable to each Participant. If, before the Agent has completed its purchases,\nthe market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds the net asset value\nof the Common Stock as of the payment date, the purchase price paid by Agent may\nexceed the net asset value of the Common Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer\nCommon Stock than if such Distribution had been paid in Common Stock issued by\nthe Fund. Because of the foregoing difficulty with respect to open-market purchases,\nthe Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount\nin open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts\n- 62 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\nto a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent may cease making\nopen-market purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount\nin newly issued Common Stock at the net asset value per Common Stock at the\nclose of business on the last purchase date. Participants should note that they will\nnot be able to instruct the Agent to purchase Common Stock at a specific time or at\na specific price. Open-market purchases may be made on any securities exchange\nwhere Common Stock are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in negotiated\ntransactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and otherwise as the\nAgent shall determine. Each Participant’s uninvested funds held by the Agent will\nnot bear interest. The Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability\nto purchase Common Stock within the time provided, or with the timing of any\npurchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of Common\nStock acquired. The Agent may commingle Participants’ funds to be used for open-\nmarket purchases of the Fund’s shares and the price per share allocable to each\nParticipant in connection with such purchases shall be the average price (including\nbrokerage commissions and other related costs) of all Fund shares purchased by\nAgent. The rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission may\nrequire the Agent to limit the Agent’s market purchases or temporarily cease making\nmarket purchases for Participants.\n5. The market price of Common Stock on a particular date shall be the last sales price on\nthe securities exchange where the Common Stock are listed on that date (currently the\nNASDAQ Capital Market)(the “Exchange”), or, if there is no sale on the Exchange\non that date, then the average between the closing bid and asked quotations on the\nExchange on such date will be used. The net asset value per Common Stock on a\nparticular date shall be the amount calculated on that date (or if not calculated on such\ndate, the amount most recently calculated) by or on behalf of the Fund.\n6. Whenever the Agent receives or purchases shares or fractional interests for a\nParticipant’s account, the Agent will send such Participant a notification of the\ntransaction as soon as practicable. The Agent will hold such shares and fractional\ninterests as such Participant’s agent and may hold them in the Agent’s name or the\nname of the Agent’s nominee. The Agent will not send a Participant stock certificates\nfor shares unless a Participant so requests in writing or unless a Participant’s account\nis terminated as stated below. The Agent will vote any shares so held for a Participant\nin accordance with any proxy returned to the Fund by such Participant in respect of\nthe shares of which such Participant is the record holder.\n7. There is presently no service charge for the Agent serving as Participants’ agent and\nmaintaining Participants’ accounts. The Agent may, however, charge Participants for\nextra services performed at their request. The Plan may be amended in the future to\nimpose a service charge. In acting as Participants’ agent under the Plan, the Agent\nshall be liable only for acts, omissions, losses, damages or expenses caused by the\nAgent’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, the Agent shall not be\nliable for any taxes, assessments or governmental charges which may be levied or\nassessed on any basis whatsoever in connection with the administration of the Plan.\n- 63 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\n8. The Agent may hold each Participant’s Common Stock acquired pursuant to the\nPlan together with the Common Stock of other Stockholders of the Fund acquired\npursuant to the Plan in non-certificated form in the Agent’s name or that of the\nAgent’s nominee. Each Participant will be sent a confirmation by the Agent of each\nacquisition made for his or her account as soon as practicable, but in no event later\nthan 60 days, after the date thereof. Participants may request to sell a portion of the\nCommon Stock held by the Agent in their Plan accounts by calling the Agent, writing\nto the Agent, or completing and returning the transaction form attached to each Plan\nstatement. The Agent will sell such Common Stock through a broker-dealer selected\nby the Agent within 5 business days of receipt of the request. The sale price will\nequal the weighted average price of all Common Stock sold through the Plan on the\nday of the sale, less brokerage commissions. Participants should note that the Agent\nis unable to accept instructions to sell on a specific date or at a specific price. Any\nshare dividends or split shares distributed by the Fund on Common Stock held by the\nAgent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event that the Fund\nmakes available to its Stockholders rights to purchase additional Common Stock,\nthe Common Stock held for each Participant under the Plan will be added to other\nCommon Stock held by the Participant in calculating the number of rights to be\nissued to each Participant.\nIf a Participant holds more than one Common Stock Certificate registered in similar\nbut not identical names or if more than one address is shown for a Participant on the\nFund’s records, all of such Participant’s shares of Common Stock must be put into the\nsame name and address if all of them are to be covered by one account. Additional\nshares subsequently acquired by a Participant otherwise than through the Plan will\nbe covered by the Plan.\n9. The reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve Participants of any federal, state\nor local taxes which may be payable (or required to be withheld on Distributions.)\nParticipants will receive tax information annually for their personal records and to\nhelp them prepare their federal income tax return. For further information as to tax\nconsequences of participation in the Plan, Participants should consult with their own\ntax advisors.\n10. Each registered Participant may terminate his or her account under the Plan by calling\nthe Agent at (877) 283-0317. Such termination will be effective with respect to a\nparticular Distribution if the Participant’s notice is received by the Agent prior to\nsuch Distribution record date. The Plan may be terminated by the Agent or the Fund\nupon notice in writing mailed to each Participant at least 60 days prior to the effective\ndate of the termination. Upon any termination, the Agent will cause a certificate or\ncertificates to be issued for the full shares held for each Participant under the Plan and\ncash adjustment for any fraction of a Common Share at the then current market value\nof the Common Shares to be delivered to him. If preferred, a Participant may request\nthe sale of all of the Common Shares held by the Agent in his or her Plan account\nin order to terminate participation in the Plan. If any Participant elects in advance of\nsuch termination to have Agent sell part or all of his shares, Agent is authorized to\n- 64 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\ndeduct from the proceeds the brokerage commissions incurred for the transaction. If\na Participant has terminated his or her participation in the Plan but continues to have\nCommon Shares registered in his or her name, he or she may re-enroll in the Plan at\nany time by notifying the Agent in writing at the address above.\n11. These terms and conditions may be amended by the Agent or the Fund at any time\nbut, except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or the\nrules or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory\nauthority, only by mailing to each Participant appropriate written notice at least\n30 days prior to the effective date thereof. The amendment shall be deemed to be\naccepted by each Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent\nreceives notice of the termination of the Participant’s account under the Plan. Any\nsuch amendment may include an appointment by the Agent of a successor Agent,\nsubject to the prior written approval of the successor Agent by the Fund.\n12. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan Terms are as of December 13, 2019.\nThe Board of Directors of the Fund has suspended the dividend reinvestment plan for\nthe March 31, 2024 quarterly distribution, in connection with the Fund’s cash or stock\ndistribution as previously announced to stockholders in the Fund’s press release dated\nFebruary 12, 2024. The dividend reinvestment plan was previously suspended for the\nquarterly distributions paid on September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022,\nJune 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023,\nand December 31, 2023 in connection with stock or cash distributions made on such\ndates. The Board of Directors may suspend the dividend reinvestment plan in connection\nwith future cash or stock distributions, and any such suspension will be announced to\nshareholders via press release. In a stock or cash distribution, distributions will be paid\nin cash or shares of our common stock at the election of stockholders. The total amount\nof cash distributed to all stockholders will be limited to 20% of the total distribution to\nbe paid, excluding any cash paid for fractional shares. The remainder of the distribution\n(approximately 80%) will be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. The exact\ndistribution of cash and stock to any given stockholder will be dependent upon his/her\nelection as well as elections of other stockholders, subject to the pro-rata limitation.\n- 65 -\n[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n.CNI\n,DNUF\nNISAB\nNAEBBIRAC\nDLEFZREH\nEHT\neunevA\nnotgnihsaW\n911\n405\netiuS\n93133\nLF\n,hcaeB\nimaiM\n42-RA-dlefzreH"

On that date, the\nFund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share\n(reflecting NAV dilution from the Rights\nOffering (defined below)) was $3.49, down\n27.07% over the six months then ended,\nadjusted for distributions. The Fund’s\nshare price closed the period at $2.78 per\nshare, a decline of 26.24% over the same\nsemi-annual time period, adjusted for\ndistributions. For calendar year 2023, the\nFund’s net asset value per share (reflecting\nThomas J. Herzfeld\nNAV dilution from the Rights Offering) and\nChairman and\nmarket price declined 14.45% and 13.60%,\nPortfolio Manager\nrespectively, in each case adjusted for\ndistributions. During the six-month period,\nthe discount to NAV was relatively unchanged narrowing from -20.52% to -20.34%.\nNotwithstanding the NAV dilution from the Rights Offering, the underlying holdings\nperformed well during the period and for the calendar year as evidenced by aggregate\nincreases in net assets of 6.48% for the period and 24.98% for the calendar year.\nThe Fund completed a non-transferable rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) on\nDecember 13, 2023 which resulted in the issuance of nine million (9,000,000) additional\nshares of common stock at a price of $2.31 per share, reflecting NAV dilution per share\nof $1.6053.\nThe Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through investment in companies that\nwe believe are poised to benefit from economic, political, structural, and technological\ndevelopments in the Caribbean Basin. Part of the investment strategy focuses on\ncompanies in the region that we believe would benefit from the resumption of U.S. trade\nwith Cuba. Since it is impossible to predict when the U.S. embargo will be lifted, we have\nconcentrated on investments that we believe can do well even if there is no political or\neconomic change with respect to Cuba.\nCaribbean Basin Update\nGrowth in the Caribbean Basin economies was strong in 2023 providing a positive\ninvestment backdrop. The main drivers of growth have been increases in American tourist\narrivals, oil production, and “nearshoring” of supply chains.\n“Nearshoring” of U.S. supply chains refers to a shift from the use of off-shore suppliers\n(particularly suppliers located in Asia) to suppliers that are more strategically located\nin the Western Hemisphere. There are a number of factors that have led to this shift\nincluding continuing political tensions with China and historical difficulties in receiving\n- 3 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\ninventories from Asian suppliers during the COVID and post-\nCOVID period. As a result, Caribbean economies are benefitting\nas U.S. companies shift to supply partners closer to home. For\nexample, Mexico is now the largest U.S. trading partner in dollars,\nsurpassing China. Responding to nearshoring trends, Jamaica\nis making strategic investments in its ports to enable increased\nexport of Jamaican agricultural products to the U.S. and abroad.\nWe believe the nearshoring trend will provide a long-term positive\nimpact in the region and add diversity to an economic base\nthat was previously heavily weighted to tourism, banking, and\nErik M. Herzfeld\ncommodities.\nPresident and\nPortfolio Manager\nPositive movements in the region’s oil and gas industry have\nalso been a driver of growth during the period. Guyana’s massive\noffshore oil discovery is turning one of the most impoverished\ncountries in Latin America into one of its richest, driving not only oil related industries but\nthe general service sector as well. The newfound riches for Guyana have inflamed tensions\nwith neighboring Venezuela as the Maduro government has claimed the Essequibo area of\nGuyana as part of Venezuela. However, the border dispute has not stopped oil production\noffshore which is nearly 400 thousand barrels a day and expected to triple over the next\nfew years.\nWith respect to the important tourism sector, the majority of Caribbean nations continue\nto see double-digit year-over-year growth in visitors as a result of the resilient economy in\nthe U.S. Only the U.S. Virgin Islands saw a decline of 3.8% in visitors while the Cayman\nIslands and British Virgin Islands both saw visitors increase 60.5% combined year-over-\nyear. As recession fears abate in the U.S. and the Federal Reserve is poised to start cutting\nrates, we believe continued growth in arrivals to the Caribbean will continue.\nCuba also saw a sharp uptick in visitor arrivals in 2023 after a disastrous few years since\nthe pandemic. The number of tourism arrivals in Cuba still remains well below its pre-\npandemic high which has contributed to a shrinking economy. With U.S. trade restrictions\nstill in place, the Cuban economy continues to weaken, resulting in an acceleration of the\nnumber of Cubans fleeing the country for the U.S. Over the last two years, an estimated\n400,000 Cubans have emigrated to the U.S., further impacting Cuba’s economy.\nThe Cuban government is arguably at its weakest point in the last 60 years. This has led\nto a loosening of socialist policies that allow for more capitalism, resulting in a growing\nentrepreneurial small business sector. In our annual report, we mentioned a shift in U.S.\npolicy may be coming soon per discussions we have had with private citizens currently\ndoing business in Cuba and signs emanating from the Biden Administration. Among the\nspecific policy shifts expected is a proposal to allow Cuban citizens to open bank accounts\nwith U.S. banks. This would provide fuel for entrepreneurial small business owners,\nhelping to drive growth in Cuba. While we believe that a policy shift may still come to\npass, we are concerned that these issues will take a back seat to other issues facing the\nadministration, including the expanding war in the Middle East, the continuing war in the\nUkraine, and of course the upcoming November elections.\n- 4 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nPortfolio\nWith the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes and\nsignaling three cuts by the end of 2024, our bank holdings\ncontinued to rebound after the March 2023 banking crisis that\nengulfed U.S. banks. Energy also saw strong gains in the period.\nOur holdings in utilities were mixed as higher rates continued\nto compete with defensive stocks for investment dollars.\nAdditionally, a slow start to infrastructure spending in the U.S.\nfollowing the landmark passage of the Inflation Reduction Act\nand Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resulted in weak performance\nRyan M. Paylor\nfrom companies expected to benefit from that legislation.\nPortfolio Manager\nThe largest gainer in the period was Consolidated Water Co.\nLtd. (CWCO), which gained 47.81% on the back of record revenues of $49.85 million for\nthe most recent quarter. The company has seen significant growth in its services segment\nwhich now makes up 50% of revenues. Additionally, water scarcity is becoming a more\nvisible issue globally as drought threatens agriculture, global population increases, and\nmanufacturing growth draws on supply. As a result, water desalination, recycling and\nreuse technologies are seeing significant investments which are benefitting CWCO. The\nnegative effects of climate change along with the factors impacting supply cited above\nare resulting in more demand for CWCO’s products and services which we do not see\nchanging anytime in the near-term.\nOur bank holdings all saw double-digit gains in the period, increasing between 14.69%\nand 45.61%. OFG Bancorp (OFG) was the biggest gainer in the period while Popular\nInc. (BPOP) and First Bancorp (FBP) were not far behind rising 37.90% and 37.27%\nrespectively. As we stated in previous communications, we believed Puerto Rican banks\nwere well insulated from the turmoil on the mainland and our portfolio was rewarded\nover the period. Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (BLX), known as Bladex,\ngained 14.69% in the period. We continue to believe banks servicing the Caribbean and\nLatin America are poised for a pickup in growth as nearshoring leads to more investment\nin the region. Additionally, the region is expected to benefit from stronger growth relative\nto the rest of the world and war in the Middle East is increasing demand for alternative\nroutes for trade. Bladex’s expertise is in trade finance for Latin America and the Caribbean,\nwhich is expected to expand due to changes in supply chains but also global increases in\ncommodity demand.\nAnother top performer in the period was PGT Innovations Inc. (PGTI) which gained\n39.62% over the last half of 2023. PGTI has been the target of a bidding war between\nMasonite and Miter Brands which has resulted in a $41 bid from Masonite and a $41.5 bid\nfrom Miter Brands. At the present time, PGTI has not decided which offer to accept but\nwe believe there to be limited price upside from the most recent bids.\nThe largest detractor over the six-month period was MasTec Inc. (MTZ) which declined\n35.81%. We are among the investors expecting a boom in infrastructure spending\nfollowing the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\n- 5 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nand have been disappointed so far as rising interest rates and rising inflation costs resulted\nin cancellations and postponements of proposed projects. MasTec’s acquisition spree\nover the course of the last few years helped diversify the company’s business away from\nlarge clients like AT&T and should bode well for future growth. However, increased debt\ninterest as part of this growth initiative has resulted in a decline in free cash flow and a\npause in share repurchases since 2020. With inflation declining and the Fed poised to cut\nrates in 2024, we expect a pickup in infrastructure projects as the economics improve.\nMasTec should therefore be able to concentrate on paying down debt and resuming share\nrepurchases.\nMarriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC) also struggled in the second half,\ndeclining 29.71%. The vacation ownership, rental, and property manager saw record\nrevenues in 2022 only for growth to stagnate in 2023. VAC was able to weather the\npandemic without having to add significant debt like many of its peers in the hospitality\nand lodging business. This allowed the company to repurchase shares and continue to raise\nits dividend. While the flat growth was not part of our forecast, the company is generating\nenough free cash flow to increase share repurchases and the dividend. At a 1 year forward\nPE of 10, manageable debt maturities, and increasing return of capital to shareholders, we\nbelieve the stock price will rise even if revenues remain unchanged for the second year\nin a row.\nBecle SAB de CV (CUERVO) was another weak performer in the period, declining\n18.69%. The Mexican beverage company experienced its first annual decline in revenues\nsince it went public in 2017. An appreciating Mexican peso along with higher input costs\nled to declines in sales and lower gross margins as foreign buyers’ purchasing power\ndecreased. Also, overall weakness in the alcoholic beverage market due to inflation and\nchanging tastes weighed on valuations as CUERVO’s peers saw similar weakness in 2023.\nThe company is poised to rebound as inflation declines and currency volatility decreases.\nCUERVO is the leader in the tequila market with 30% of market share. They have also\ndiversified their brands into vodka, whiskey, gin, rum, and ready-to-drink offerings. The\ncompany is estimated to return to sales growth in 2024 and with a lower leverage profile\nthan its peers. As a result, we believe CUERVO should trade at a premium to its peer\ngroup.\nOutlook\nAfter two years of interest rate hikes across the globe implemented to combat inflation,\nglobal central banks are projecting interest rate cuts over the next year. Even with\ntightening monetary policy at its peak, the Caribbean was able to deliver real GDP growth\nof 9.8% in 2023. With less restrictive monetary policy going forward in 2024 and the\nresulting increasing chances of a “soft landing” in the Americas, Caribbean economies\nshould be major beneficiaries of discretionary spending on travel along with increased\ninvestment in commodities and nearshoring infrastructure. The Fund’s recent Rights\nOffering that was concluded in December has increased our ability to deploy capital in the\nregion to take advantage of what we view as an attractive investment backdrop. Guyana\nis already seeing a “gold rush” of sorts with investors flocking to the country to invest\nin the fastest growing economy in the world. We believe there will be ancillary benefits\n- 6 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nin surrounding countries as banking, infrastructure, and trade finance will be needed to\nsupport growth.\nThere has already been significant investment in nearshoring in Mexico as U.S. trade\ndecouples from China and other overseas supply chains reliant upon adversarial countries.\nAs discussed above, we believe there are significant opportunities in the Caribbean to take\nadvantage of nearshoring.\nWe continue to be bullish on cruise lines, maintaining an overweight position in the\nindustry. The return of profitability should allow them to retire and refinance higher\ncost debt issued during the pandemic. The potential for lower rates also provides them a\ntailwind to lower financing costs. We also remain overweight companies we believe will\nbenefit from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as lower rates\nshould result in more projects coming back online as cost of capital declines.\nLargest Allocations\nThe following tables present our largest investment and geographic allocations1 as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n% of Net % of Net\nGeographic Allocation Assets Largest Portfolio Positions Assets\nUSA 33.55% Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 6.88%\nMexico 20.88% Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. 6.65%\nPuerto Rico 14.78% New Fortress Energy, Inc. 6.28%\nPanama 8.12% MasTec, Inc. 5.24%\nLiberia 6.88% First BanCorp. 4.99%\nBermuda 6.65% Popular, Inc. 4.69%\nNetherlands 6.61% NextEra Energy, Inc. 4.40%\nBahamas 1.07% Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. 4.30%\nCayman Islands 0.83% Cemex S.A.B. de C.V. 4.15%\nCuba 0.00% Playa Hotels and Resorts 3.46%\nMoney Market 12.65%\nLiabilities in excess of\nother assets -12.02%\n100.00%\nQuarterly Distributions in Stock and Cash\nOn December 29, 2023, under the Fund’s managed distribution policy (the “Policy”), we\nannounced a quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.135375 per share for common\nstockholders to be paid January 31, 2024. The distribution will be paid in cash or shares\n1 Geographic allocation is determined by the issuer’s legal domicile.\n- 7 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\nof our common stock at the election of stockholders. The distribution in stock and cash is\nconsistent with the Fund’s most recent prior quarterly distributions.\nThe total amount of cash distributed to all stockholders will be limited to 20% of the total\ndistribution to be paid excluding any cash paid for fractional shares. The remainder of\nthe distribution (approximately 80%) will be paid in the form of shares of our common\nstock. The exact distribution of cash and stock to any given stockholder will be dependent\nupon his/her election as well as elections of other stockholders, subject to the pro-rata\nlimitations.\nWe believe this cash and stock distribution will allow the Fund to strengthen its balance\nsheet and to be in position to capitalize on potential future investment opportunities.\nThe primary purpose of the Policy is to provide stockholders with a constant, but not\nguaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each quarter (currently set at the annual\nrate of 15% of the Fund’s net asset value as determined on December 19, 2023 and payable\nin quarterly installments). The Fund cannot predict what effect, if any, the Policy will have\non the market price of its shares or whether such market price will reflect a greater or lesser\ndiscount to net asset value as compared to prior to the adoption of the Policy.\nResults of Rights Offering\nOn December 18, 2023, the Fund announced the final results of its non-transferable rights\noffering (the “Offering”) that expired on December 13, 2023 (the “Expiration Date”).\nThe Fund issued a total of 9,000,000 new shares of common stock as a result of the\nOffering. The Offering’s final subscription price per share was determined to be $2.31.\nThe subscription price was established pursuant to the terms of the Offering and based on\na formula equal to 92% of the volume weighted average closing sales price of a share of\ncommon stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on the Expiration Date of the Offering\nand the four preceding trading days. The Offering was oversubscribed and the over-\nsubscription requests exceeded the primary subscription shares available (i.e., 7,150,673\nshares). The Board of Directors of the Fund determined to issue an additional 25.86% of\nthe number of shares issued in the primary subscription, or 1,849,327 additional shares,\nfor a total issuance of 9,000,000 new shares of common stock. The shares issued as part\nof the oversubscription privilege of the Offering were allocated pro rata among record\n- 8 -\nLetter to Stockholders (unaudited) (continued)\ndate stockholders who submitted over-subscription requests based on the number of rights\noriginally issued to them by the Fund. Gross proceeds from the Offering, before any\nexpenses of the Offering, totaled approximately $20.8 million.\nThomas J. Herzfeld Erik M. Herzfeld Ryan M.

ORGANIZATION AND RELATED MATTERS\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”) is a non-diversified, closed-end\nmanagement investment company incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on\nMarch 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,\nand follows accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, “Financial\nServices - Investment Companies”. The Fund commenced investing activities in January\n1994. The Fund is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol\n“CUBA.”\nThe Fund’s investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund\npursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked securities of public\nand private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i) whose securities are traded\nprincipally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin Country or (ii) that have at least\n50% of the value of their assets in a Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least\n50% of their total revenue from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country (collectively,\n“Caribbean Basin Companies”). Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80%\nof its total assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin Countries. This\n80% policy may be changed without stockholder approval upon sixty days written notice\nto stockholders. The Fund’s investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed\nwithout the approval of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities.\nUnder the Fund’s organizational documents, its Officers and Directors are indemnified\nagainst certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In\naddition, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts with its vendors\nand others that provide for general indemnifications. The Fund’s maximum exposure\nunder these arrangements is unknown as this would involve any future potential claims\nthat may be made against the Fund. However, based on experience, management expects\nthe risk of loss to be remote.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSecurity Valuation\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date.\nIn determining fair value, the Fund uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with\nGAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the\nuse of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that\nobservable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Fund.\nUnobservable inputs reflect the Fund’s assumptions about the inputs market participants\n- 19 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels\nbased on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe Fund has the ability to access.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are\nobservable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs\nmay include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an active market,\nprices for similar instruments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,\nyield curves, default rates, and similar data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant\nobservable inputs are not available, representing the Fund’s own assumptions\nabout the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset\nor liability, and that would be based on the best information available.\nThe availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from security to\nsecurity and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, the type of security, whether\nthe security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics\nparticular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that\nare less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires\nmore judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that\nmay be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be\nreasonably determined. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated\nvalues may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had\na ready market for the securities existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised\nby the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3. In\ncertain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy\nwithin which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls, is determined based on the\nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market\nparticipant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market\nassumptions are not readily available, the Fund’s own assumptions are set to reflect those\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThe Fund uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including\nperiods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many securities. This condition could cause a security to\nbe reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported on the\nNASDAQ National Market or Capital Market) are stated at the last reported sales price\non the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price); other securities traded\nin the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on\nthat date are stated at the last quoted bid price. Restricted securities and other securities\n- 20 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nfor which quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined, in\ngood faith, by the Advisor, as “valuation designee” under the oversight of the Board of\nDirectors.\nThe following table summarizes the classification of the Fund’s investments by the above\nfair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2023:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets (at fair value)\nCommon Stocks\nUSA $ 18,806,909 $ — $ 45,152 $ 18,852,061\nMexico 11,737,502 — — 11,737,502\nPuerto Rico 7,915,526 391,447 — 8,306,973\nPanama 4,562,739 — — 4,562,739\nLiberia 3,866,960 — — 3,866,960\nBermuda 3,739,023 — — 3,739,023\nNetherlands 3,715,501 — — 3,715,501\nBahamas 602,987 — — 602,987\nCayman 464,419 — — 464,419\nBonds\nCuba — — — —\nMoney Market Funds 7,111,962 — — 7,111,962\nTotal Investments in\nsecurities $ 62,523,528 $ 391,447 $ 45,152 $ 62,960,127\nThe fair valued securities (Level 3) held in the Fund consisted of Cuban Electric Company,\nCeramica Carabobo, Fuego Enterprises, Inc., Siderurgica Venezolana Sivensa S.A.,\nWaterloo Investment Holdings Ltd. and Republic of Cuba 4.5% bond.\nThe following is a reconciliation of assets in which significant unobservable inputs (Level\n3) were used to determine fair value as of December 31, 2023:\nLevel 3\nBalance as of 6/30/23 $ 45,152\nSales —\nRealized gain/(loss) —\nChange in unrealized gain/(loss) —\nTransfer into Level 3 —\nTransfer out of Level 3 —\nBalance as of 12/31/23 $ 45,152\nUnder procedures approved by the Board of Directors, the Advisor provides administration\nand oversight of the Fund’s valuation policies and procedures, which are reviewed at least\n- 21 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nannually by the Directors. Among other things, these procedures allow the Fund to utilize\nindependent pricing services, quotations from securities and financial instrument dealers\nand other market sources to determine fair value.\nThe Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of securities and other financial\ninstruments for which market prices are not readily available. Under these procedures, the\nAdvisor convenes on a regular and ad hoc basis to review such securities and considers\na number of factors, including valuation methodologies and significant unobservable\nvaluation inputs, when determining a fair value. The Advisor may employ a market-based\napproach which may use related or comparable assets or liabilities, recent transactions,\nmarket multiples, book values and other relevant information for the investment to\ndetermine the fair value of the investment. An income-based valuation approach may\nalso be used in which the anticipated future cash flows of the investment are discounted\nto calculate fair value. Discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any\nrestrictions on the disposition of investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of\nvaluations of such investments, the fair values may differ significantly from the values\nthat would have been used had an active market existed. The Advisor employs various\nmethods for calibrating these valuation approaches including a regular view of valuation\nmethodologies, key inputs and assumptions, transactional back-testing or disposition\nanalysis and reviews of any related market activity.\nThe Fund adopted policies to comply with the SEC’s new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940\nAct, which establishes a regulatory framework for registered investment company fair\nvaluation practices. The Fund’s fair value policies and procedures and valuation practices\nwere updated prior to the rule’s required compliance date of September 8, 2022. Under\nRule 2a-5, the Fund’s Board of Directors designated the Advisor as the Fund’s “Valuation\nDesignee” to make fair value determinations.\nIncome Recognition\nSecurity transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on securities sold\nare determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-\ndividend date or in the case of certain foreign securities, as soon as the Fund is notified,\nand interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on debt\nsecurities purchased are amortized over the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund’s\npractice to include the portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments\ndenominated in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses on investments and foreign currency. Withholding on foreign taxes have been\nprovided for in accordance with the Fund’s understanding of the applicable country’s tax\nrules and rates.\nForeign Currency\nThe accounting records of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency\namounts and investments denominated in a foreign currency, if any, are translated into\nU.S. dollar amounts at current exchange rates on the valuation date. Purchases and sales\n- 22 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nof investments denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts\nat the exchange rate on the respective dates of such transactions.\nDeposits with Financial Institutions\nThe Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances with\nfinancial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.\nCounterparty Brokers\nIn the normal course of business, substantially all of the Fund’s money balances and\nsecurity positions are custodied with the Fund’s custodian, Fifth Third Bank N.A. The\nFund also transacts with other brokers. The Fund is subject to credit risk to the extent any\nbroker with which it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its\nbehalf. The Fund’s management monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does\nnot anticipate any losses from these counterparties.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Fund’s policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended, that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to\ndistribute substantially all of its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,\nthe Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no federal income\nor excise tax provision is required.\nThe Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.\nDistributions to Stockholders\nUnder a managed distribution plan, for the six months ended December 31, 2023 the Fund\npaid distributions to stockholders payable in quarterly installments at an annual rate set at\n15% of the Fund’s December 19, 2023 NAV. The quarterly distributions may be sourced\nfrom income, paid-in capital, and/or capital gains, if any. To the extent that sufficient\ninvestment income is not available on a quarterly basis, the Fund may distribute paid-in\ncapital and/or capital gains, if any, in order to maintain its managed distribution level.\nThe Board suspended the managed distribution plan in August 2023 and reinstated the\nmanaged distribution plan effective November 22, 2023.\nDistributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and capital\ngain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may\n- 23 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\ndiffer from GAAP. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, a distribution from\nreturn of capital of $0.135375 per share was declared on December 29, 2023.\nDue to the timing of dividend distributions and the differences in accounting for income\nand realized gains and losses for financial statement and federal income tax purposes, the\nfiscal year in which the amounts are distributed may differ from the year in which the\nincome and realized gains and losses are recorded by the Fund.\nDerivatives Risk Management Program\nThe Fund adopted policies and procedures to comply with the SEC’s new Rule 18f-4 under\nthe 1940 Act, which limits the amount of derivatives a fund can enter into, eliminates\nthe asset segregation framework previously used by funds to comply with Section 18\nof the 1940 Act, treats derivatives as senior securities and requires funds whose use of\nderivatives is more than a limited specified exposure amount to establish and maintain\na comprehensive derivatives risk management program and when applicable, appoint a\nderivatives risk manager. The Fund adopted a derivatives risk management program to\nimplement and comply with Rule 18f-4 prior to the SEC’s required compliance date of\nAugust 19, 2022 in the event it is required to rely on Rule 18f-4.\nNOTE 3. RESTRICTED SECURITIES OWNED\nInvestments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of Cuba\nbonds, $140,000 purchased for $52,850 on February 15, 1995 and $25,000 purchased\nfor $10,188 on April 27, 1995, that are currently segregated and restricted from transfer.\nThe bonds were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and had been trading\nin default since 1960. A “regulatory halt” on trading was imposed by the NYSE in July\n1995 and trading in the bonds was suspended as of December 28, 2006. The NYSE has\nstated that following the suspension of trading, application will be made to the Securities\nand Exchange Commission to delist the issue.

As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the position was valued at $0 under procedures approved by the\nBoard of Directors.\nNOTE 4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND OTHER SERVICE\nPROVIDERS\nTransactions with Affiliates\nHERZFELD / CUBA (the “Advisor”), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc.,\nis the Fund’s investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual rate of 1.45%\nof the Fund’s average daily net assets. Total fees for the six months ended December 31,\n2023 amounted to $259,712, before the waiver described below. Mr. Thomas J. Herzfeld\nis the owner of the Advisor.\n- 24 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nThe Advisor has agreed to voluntarily waive its management fee by ten basis points, in\nsupport of the Fund’s initiative to attempt to reduce the stock price discount to NAV.\nEffective November 22, 2023, the Adviser has further agreed to voluntarily waive its\nmanagement fee on the Fund’s net assets in excess of $30 million by an additional ten\nbasis points. Accordingly, the Adviser’s management fee after the voluntary waivers\nis (i) 1.35% of the Fund’s assets up to and including $30 million and (ii) 1.25% of the\nFund’s assets in excess of $30 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the\nAdvisor waived fees in the amount of $19,149. As of December 31, 2023 the Fund owed\nthe Advisor $49,676.\nTMorgan Advisers, LLC (“TMA”) has been engaged by the Advisor to provide, among\nother things, certain compliance and operational support services with respect to the\nFund, including the services of Mr. Thomas K. Morgan as the Fund’s chief compliance\nofficer. The fees charged by TMA for services to the Fund are billed directly to the Fund\nby TMA. Fees charged by TMA and/or Mr. Morgan for services provided to the Advisor\nare paid directly by the Advisor. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the total\ncompliance and operational support services fees paid or payable by the Fund to TMA\namounted to $30,164.\nOther Service Providers\nUnder a Master Services Agreement between Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC (“Ultimus”)\nand the Fund, Ultimus is responsible for fund administration, including generally\nmanaging the administrative affairs of the Fund, and supervising the preparation of reports\nto stockholders, reports to and filings with the SEC and materials for meetings of the\nBoard. Ultimus is also responsible for fund accounting, including calculating the net asset\nvalue per share and maintaining the financial books and records of the Fund. Ultimus also\nserves as the transfer agent and provides shareholder services to the Fund. The Master\nServices Agreement permits Ultimus to subcontract for the provision of services it has\ncontracted for under the Master Services Agreement, and Ultimus has subcontracted\ntransfer agency services to Equiniti Trust Company, LLC. Ultimus is entitled to receive\na fee in accordance with the agreement and was paid $34,898 for the six months ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe Fund has entered into an agreement with Fifth Third Bank N.A. to serve as the\ncustodian for the Fund’s assets.\nNOTE 5. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, purchases and sales of investment\nsecurities were $19,006,350 and $579,889, respectively.\nNOTE 6. INCOME TAX INFORMATION\nThe cost basis of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower than the cost\nbasis for income tax purposes by $233,171 due to wash sale adjustments, passive foreign\ninvestment companies and book-to-tax adjustments to partnership investment. As of\n- 25 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nDecember 31, 2023 gross unrealized gains were $16,472,405 and gross unrealized losses\nwere $(578,794) for income tax purposes.\nPermanent differences accounted for during the year ended June 30, 2023, result from\ndifferences between book and tax accounting for the characterization of foreign currency\nlosses, partnership adjustments, and the reclassification of the Fund’s net investment loss\nfor tax purposes. Such amounts have been reclassified as follows:\nTotal\nDistributable Additional Paid\nEarnings in Capital\nYear ended June 30, 2023 $ 804,272 $ (804,272)\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Fund had no post-October losses which are deferred until fiscal\nyear 2023 for tax purposes. Capital losses incurred after October 31 (“post-October\nlosses”) within that taxable year are deemed to arise on the first day of the Fund’s next\ntaxable year.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Fund had $19,375 of qualified late-year ordinary losses, which\nare deferred until fiscal year 2023 for tax purposes. Net late-year losses incurred after\nDecember 31 within the taxable year are deemed to arise on the first day of the Fund’s\nnext taxable year.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Fund is required to determine whether a tax position is\nmore likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority,\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical\nmerits of the position. The Fund files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction\nand may file income tax returns in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. Generally\nthe Fund is no longer subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for\nyears before June 30, 2020. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount\nof benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement.\nDe-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized results in the Fund recording a tax\nliability that reduces ending net assets.\nThe Fund’s policy would be to recognize accrued interest expense to unrecognized tax\nbenefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. There were none for the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nThe tax character of distributions paid to stockholders during the years ended June 30,\n2023 and June 30, 2022 were as follows: ordinary income of $0 and $194,711, respectively,\nlong-term capital gains of $714,706 and $1,148,768, respectively, and a return of capital of\n$3,893,734 and $4,951,954, respectively.\n- 26 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nNOTE 7. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS\nShares of Common Stock\nThe Fund has 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 16,150,673 issued\nand outstanding at December 31, 2023. Transactions in common stock for the six months\nended December 31, 2023, were as follows:\nShares at beginning of period 7,150,673\nShares issued in connection with rights offering 9,000,000\nShares issued in revinvestment of dividends and distributions —\nShares at end of period 16,150,673\n2023 Rights Offering\nOn December 19, 2023, the Fund issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock in connection\nwith a rights offering. Stockholders of record November 3, 2023 were issued one non-\ntransferable right for every share owned on that date. The rights entitled the stockholders\nto purchase one new share of common stock for every one right held. In addition, the\nFund had the discretion to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to\nsubscription by up to 200% of the shares offered, or up to an additional 14,301,346 shares\nof common stock.\nThe subscription price was equal to 92% of the average volume-weighted closing sales\nprice per share of the Fund’s common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on December\n13, 2023, and the four preceding trading days. The final subscription price was $2.31 per\nshare. The offering was oversubscribed and the oversubscription requests exceeded the\nprimary shares available. The Fund issued an additional 25.86% of the number of shares\nissued in the primary subscription, or 1,849,327 additional shares, for a total issuance of\n9,000,000 new shares of common stock. Net proceeds to the Fund were $20,607,216, after\ndeducting rights offering costs of $182,784. The net asset value of the Fund’s common\nshares was decreased by approximately $1.60 per share, as a result of the share issuance.\n2022 Tender Offer\nThe Fund’s Board of Directors determined to commence an offer to purchase up to 5%,\nor 338,382 Shares of the Fund’s issued and outstanding Common Stock. The offer was a\ncash offer at a price equal to 97.5% of the Fund’s net asset value per share (“NAV”) as of\nthe close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on November 8, 2022. As a\nresult of Tender Offer 338,382 shares were purchased.\n2021 Shelf Registration\nThe Fund has incurred approximately $67,342 of offering costs in association with a shelf\nregistration, which is recorded as deferred offering costs and will be amortized over the\nlife of the shelf registration if and when new shares are issued. These costs are categorized\n- 27 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nas deferred offering costs (shelf) on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, $0 has been amortized.\nNOTE 8. INVESTMENT RISKS\nForeign Securities Risk\nSecurities traded in foreign markets have often (though not always) performed differently from\nsecurities traded in the United States. However, such investments often involve special risks\nnot present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. In\nparticular, the Fund is subject to the risk that because there may be fewer investors on foreign\nexchanges and a smaller number of securities traded each day, it may be more difficult for the\nFund to buy and sell securities on those exchanges. In addition, prices of foreign securities may\ngo up and down more than prices of securities traded in the United States.\nForeign Economy Risk\nThe economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy\nof the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product,\nreinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. Certain foreign\neconomies may rely heavily on particular industries or foreign capital and are more\nvulnerable to diplomatic developments, the imposition of economic sanctions against a\nparticular country or countries, changes in international trading patterns, trade barriers\nand other protectionist or retaliatory measures. Investments in foreign markets may also\nbe adversely affected by governmental actions such as the imposition of capital controls,\nnationalization of companies or industries, expropriation of assets or the imposition of\npunitive taxes. In addition, the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose\nsubstantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain\nindustries. Any of these actions could severely affect securities prices or impair the Fund’s\nability to purchase or sell foreign securities or transfer the Fund’s assets or income back\ninto the United States, or otherwise adversely affect the Fund’s operations.\nOther potential foreign market risks include foreign exchange controls, difficulties in\npricing securities, defaults on foreign government securities, difficulties in enforcing legal\njudgments in foreign courts and political and social instability. Legal remedies available\nto investors in certain foreign countries may be less extensive than those available to\ninvestors in the United States.\nCurrency Risk\nSecurities and other instruments in which the Fund invests may be denominated or quoted\nin currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may\naffect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Because the Fund’s assets are primarily invested in\nsecurities of Caribbean Basin Companies, and because some portion of revenues and income\nmay be received in foreign currencies while Fund distributions will be made in dollars, the\ndollar equivalent of the Fund’s net assets and distributions would be adversely affected by\nreductions in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the dollar. For this reason, changes\nin foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Generally,\n- 28 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nwhen the U.S. Dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. Dollars. Conversely, when\nthe U.S. Dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that\ncurrency gains value because the currency is worth more U.S. Dollars. This risk, generally\nknown as “currency risk,” means that a strong U.S. Dollar may reduce returns for U.S.\ninvestors while a weak U.S. Dollar may increase those returns. The Fund is managed with\nthe assumption that most of its stockholders hold their assets in U.S. Dollars. As a result, and\nbecause distributions are made in U.S. Dollars, other non-U.S. investors will be adversely\naffected by reductions in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to their home currency.\nGeographic Concentration Risk\nThe Fund may invest from time to time a substantial amount of assets in issuers located in\na single country or a limited number of countries. If the Fund concentrates its investments\nin this manner, it assumes the risk that economic, political and social conditions in those\ncountries will have a significant impact on its investment performance. The Fund’s\ninvestment performance may also be more volatile if it concentrates its investments in\ncertain countries, especially emerging market countries.\nManaged Distribution Risk\nUnder the managed distribution plan, the Fund makes quarterly distributions to\nstockholders at a rate set once a year that is a percentage of the Fund’s NAV at its most\nrecent fiscal year-end, that may be sourced from income, paid-in capital, and/or capital\ngains, if any. To the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a quarterly\nbasis, the Fund may distribute paid-in capital and/or capital gains, if any, in order to\nmaintain its managed distribution level. No conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s\ninvestment performance from the amount of the Fund’s distributions or from the terms of\nthe managed distribution plan. A return of capital occurs when some or all of the money\nthat stockholders invested in the Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not\nreflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or\n“income.” Any such returns of capital will decrease the Fund’s total assets and, therefore,\ncould have the effect of increasing the Fund’s expense ratio. In addition, in order to make\nsuch distributions, the Fund may have to sell a portion of its investment portfolio at a\nless than opportune time. There is a risk that amendment or termination of the managed\ndistribution plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund’s shares.\nMarket Risk\nThe value of the securities in which the Fund invests may be affected by political,\nregulatory, economic and social developments, and developments that impact specific\neconomic sectors, industries or segments of the market. In addition, turbulence in\nfinancial markets and reduced liquidity in equity, credit and/or fixed income markets may\nnegatively affect many issuers, which could adversely affect the Fund. Global economies\nand financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, and conditions and\nevents in one country, region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a\ndifferent country, region or financial market. These risks may be magnified if certain\n- 29 -\nNotes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)\nevents or developments adversely interrupt the global supply chain; in these and other\ncircumstances, such risks might affect companies world-wide. Recent examples include\npandemic risks related to coronavirus outbreaks and aggressive measures taken world-\nwide in response by governments, and by businesses, including changes to operations and\nreducing staff.\nThe impact of pandemic risks may last for an extended period of time and result in a\nsubstantial economic downturn. Any such impact could adversely affect the Fund’s\nperformance.\nNOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Fund announced that the Board had approved a tender offer to purchase up to 10% of\nthe net asset value of the Fund’s common stock at a price equal to 97.5% of the Fund’s net\nasset value as of the close of ordinary trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March\n19, 2024. The Fund commenced its tender offer on February 20, 2024, and the expiration\nof the tender offer is March 19, 2024, unless the offer is extended.\nManagement has evaluated the impact of subsequent events on the Fund, through the date\nthe financial statements were issued, and has determined that there were no additional\nsubsequent events that required disclosure in the financial statements.\n- 30 -\nSection 19(a) Notices (unaudited)\nThe Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.’s (CUBA) (the “Fund”) amounts and sources of\ndistributions reported are estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory\nrequirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts\nand sources for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience\nduring the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax\nregulations. The Fund will provide a Form 1099-DIV each calendar year that will tell you\nhow to report these distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n% Breakdown\nTotal of the Total\nCumulative Cumulative\n% Breakdown Distributions Distributions\nCurrency of the Current for the Fiscal for the Fiscal\nDistribution Distribution Year to Date Year to Date\nNet Investment Income $ 0.00 0% $ 0.00 0%\nNet Realized Short-\nTerm Capital Gains $ 0.00 0% $ 0.00 0%\nNet Realized Long-\nTerm Capital Gains $ 0.00 0% $ 0.00 0%\nReturn of Capital (a) $ 0.1354 100% $ 0.1354 100%\nTotal\n(per common share) $ 0.1354 100% $ 0.1354 100%\n(a) The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than the amount of earned income and net\nrealized gains; therefore, a portion of the distribution may be a return of capital. A return of\ncapital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment in the Fund are\nreturned to the shareholder. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment\nperformance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. When distributions exceed\ntotal return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per share.\nSection 19(a) notices for the Fund, are available on the Fund’s website\nhttp://www.herzfeld.com/cuba.\n- 31 -\nResults of November 16, 2023 Stockholders Meeting (unaudited)\nThe annual meeting of stockholders of the Fund was held on November 16, 2023.

If on the payment date for a Distribution,\nthe net asset value per Common Stock is equal to or less than the market price per\nCommon Stock plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Agent shall receive\nnewly issued Common Stock (“Additional Common Stock”) from the Fund for each\nParticipant’s account. The number of Additional Common Stock to be credited shall\nbe determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the greater of (i)\nthe net asset value per Common Share on the payment date, or (ii) 95% of the market\nprice per Common Share on the payment date.\n4. MARKET DISCOUNT PURCHASES. If the net asset value per Common Stock\nexceeds the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date\nfor a Distribution, the Agent (or a broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall endeavor\nto apply the amount of such Distribution on each Participant’s Common Stock to\npurchase Common Stock on the open market. In the event of a market discount on\nthe payment date, the Agent will have 30 days after the dividend payment date (the\n“last purchase date”) to invest the dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market\npurchases. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all\nCommon Stock purchased by the Agent as Agent shall be the price per Common\nStock allocable to each Participant. If, before the Agent has completed its purchases,\nthe market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds the net asset value\nof the Common Stock as of the payment date, the purchase price paid by Agent may\nexceed the net asset value of the Common Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer\nCommon Stock than if such Distribution had been paid in Common Stock issued by\nthe Fund. Because of the foregoing difficulty with respect to open-market purchases,\nthe Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount\nin open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts\n- 35 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\nto a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent may cease making\nopen-market purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount\nin newly issued Common Stock at the net asset value per Common Stock at the\nclose of business on the last purchase date. Participants should note that they will\nnot be able to instruct the Agent to purchase Common Stock at a specific time or at\na specific price. Open-market purchases may be made on any securities exchange\nwhere Common Stock are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in negotiated\ntransactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and otherwise as the\nAgent shall determine. Each Participant’s uninvested funds held by the Agent will\nnot bear interest. The Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability\nto purchase Common Stock within the time provided, or with the timing of any\npurchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of Common\nStock acquired. The Agent may commingle Participants’ funds to be used for open-\nmarket purchases of the Fund’s shares and the price per share allocable to each\nParticipant in connection with such purchases shall be the average price (including\nbrokerage commissions and other related costs) of all Fund shares purchased by\nAgent. The rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission may\nrequire the Agent to limit the Agent’s market purchases or temporarily cease making\nmarket purchases for Participants.\n5. The market price of Common Stock on a particular date shall be the last sales price on\nthe securities exchange where the Common Stock are listed on that date (currently the\nNASDAQ Capital Market)(the “Exchange”), or, if there is no sale on the Exchange\non that date, then the average between the closing bid and asked quotations on the\nExchange on such date will be used. The net asset value per Common Stock on a\nparticular date shall be the amount calculated on that date (or if not calculated on such\ndate, the amount most recently calculated) by or on behalf of the Fund.\n6. Whenever the Agent receives or purchases shares or fractional interests for a\nParticipant’s account, the Agent will send such Participant a notification of the\ntransaction as soon as practicable. The Agent will hold such shares and fractional\ninterests as such Participant’s agent and may hold them in the Agent’s name or the\nname of the Agent’s nominee. The Agent will not send a Participant stock certificates\nfor shares unless a Participant so requests in writing or unless a Participant’s account\nis terminated as stated below. The Agent will vote any shares so held for a Participant\nin accordance with any proxy returned to the Fund by such Participant in respect of\nthe shares of which such Participant is the record holder.\n7. There is presently no service charge for the Agent serving as Participants’ agent and\nmaintaining Participants’ accounts. The Agent may, however, charge Participants for\nextra services performed at their request. The Plan may be amended in the future to\nimpose a service charge. In acting as Participants’ agent under the Plan, the Agent\nshall be liable only for acts, omissions, losses, damages or expenses caused by the\nAgent’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, the Agent shall not be\nliable for any taxes, assessments or governmental charges which may be levied or\nassessed on any basis whatsoever in connection with the administration of the Plan.\n- 36 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\n8. The Agent may hold each Participant’s Common Stock acquired pursuant to the\nPlan together with the Common Stock of other Stockholders of the Fund acquired\npursuant to the Plan in non-certificated form in the Agent’s name or that of the\nAgent’s nominee. Each Participant will be sent a confirmation by the Agent of each\nacquisition made for his or her account as soon as practicable, but in no event later\nthan 60 days, after the date thereof. Participants may request to sell a portion of the\nCommon Stock held by the Agent in their Plan accounts by calling the Agent, writing\nto the Agent, or completing and returning the transaction form attached to each Plan\nstatement. The Agent will sell such Common Stock through a broker-dealer selected\nby the Agent within 5 business days of receipt of the request. The sale price will\nequal the weighted average price of all Common Stock sold through the Plan on the\nday of the sale, less brokerage commissions. Participants should note that the Agent\nis unable to accept instructions to sell on a specific date or at a specific price. Any\nshare dividends or split shares distributed by the Fund on Common Stock held by the\nAgent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event that the Fund\nmakes available to its Stockholders rights to purchase additional Common Stock,\nthe Common Stock held for each Participant under the Plan will be added to other\nCommon Stock held by the Participant in calculating the number of rights to be\nissued to each Participant.\nIf a Participant holds more than one Common Stock Certificate registered in similar\nbut not identical names or if more than one address is shown for a Participant on the\nFund’s records, all of such Participant’s shares of Common Stock must be put into the\nsame name and address if all of them are to be covered by one account. Additional\nshares subsequently acquired by a Participant otherwise than through the Plan will\nbe covered by the Plan.\n9. The reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve Participants of any federal, state\nor local taxes which may be payable (or required to be withheld on Distributions.)\nParticipants will receive tax information annually for their personal records and to\nhelp them prepare their federal income tax return. For further information as to tax\nconsequences of participation in the Plan, Participants should consult with their own\ntax advisors.\n10. Each registered Participant may terminate his or her account under the Plan by calling\nthe Agent at (877) 283-0317. Such termination will be effective with respect to a\nparticular Distribution if the Participant’s notice is received by the Agent prior to\nsuch Distribution record date. The Plan may be terminated by the Agent or the Fund\nupon notice in writing mailed to each Participant at least 60 days prior to the effective\ndate of the termination. Upon any termination, the Agent will cause a certificate or\ncertificates to be issued for the full shares held for each Participant under the Plan and\ncash adjustment for any fraction of a Common Share at the then current market value\nof the Common Shares to be delivered to him. If preferred, a Participant may request\nthe sale of all of the Common Shares held by the Agent in his or her Plan account\nin order to terminate participation in the Plan. If any Participant elects in advance of\nsuch termination to have Agent sell part or all of his shares, Agent is authorized to\n- 37 -\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)\ndeduct from the proceeds the brokerage commissions incurred for the transaction. If\na Participant has terminated his or her participation in the Plan but continues to have\nCommon Shares registered in his or her name, he or she may re-enroll in the Plan at\nany time by notifying the Agent in writing at the address above.\n11. These terms and conditions may be amended by the Agent or the Fund at any time\nbut, except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or the\nrules or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory\nauthority, only by mailing to each Participant appropriate written notice at least\n30 days prior to the effective date thereof. The amendment shall be deemed to be\naccepted by each Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent\nreceives notice of the termination of the Participant’s account under the Plan. Any\nsuch amendment may include an appointment by the Agent of a successor Agent,\nsubject to the prior written approval of the successor Agent by the Fund.\n12. These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan terms are as of December 13, 2019.\nThe Board of Directors of the Fund has suspended the dividend reinvestment plan for\nthe March 31, 2024 quarterly distribution, in connection with the Fund’s cash or stock\ndistribution as previously announced to stockholders in the Fund’s press release dated\nFebruary 12, 2024. The dividend reinvestment plan was previously suspended for the\nquarterly distributions paid on September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022,\nJune 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023,\nand December 31, 2023 in connection with stock or cash distributions made on such\ndates. The Board of Directors may suspend the dividend reinvestment plan in connection\nwith future cash or stock distributions, and any such suspension will be announced to\nshareholders via press release. In a stock or cash distribution, distributions will be paid\nin cash or shares of our common stock at the election of stockholders. The total amount\nof cash distributed to all stockholders will be limited to 20% of the total distribution to\nbe paid, excluding any cash paid for fractional shares. The remainder of the distribution\n(approximately 80%) will be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. The exact\ndistribution of cash and stock to any given stockholder will be dependent upon his/her\nelection as well as elections of other stockholders, subject to the pro-rata limitation.\n- 38 -\nDiscussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement (unaudited)\nThe Fund’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), including a majority of those directors\nwho are not “interested persons” as such term is defined in the 1940 Act (“Independent\nDirectors”), unanimously approved the continuance of the investment advisory agreement\nbetween the Fund and the Advisor (the “Advisory Agreement”) at a meeting held on\nAugust 10, 2023.\nIn connection with its approval of the continuance of the Advisory Agreement, the\nIndependent Directors noted that they were provided with written materials provided by\nthe Advisor and by the Fund’s legal counsel including (i) a memorandum from the Fund’s\nlegal counsel regarding the Directors’ responsibilities in evaluating and approving the\nAdvisory Agreement, (ii) responses from the Advisor containing detailed information\nabout the Advisor’s services to the Fund, Fund performance, allocation of Fund\ntransactions, compliance and administration information, and the compensation received\nby the Advisor from the Fund; (iii) a copy of the Advisory Agreement between the Fund\nand the Advisor; (iv) the Advisor’s Form ADV Parts 1A and 2A; (v) audited financial\nstatements for the Advisor for the year-ended December 31, 2022 and unaudited financial\nstatements for the six months ended June 30, 2023; (vi) comparative performance data\nfor the Fund relative to peer funds (foreign equity funds including emerging market and\nLatin American regional and single country funds) for the six-month and the twelve-month\nperiods ended June 30, 2023 and (vii) comparative statistics and expense ratios and fee\ndata for the Fund relative to foreign equity closed-end peer funds.\nDuring its deliberations on whether to approve the continuance of the Advisory Agreement,\nthe Board considered many factors. The Board considered the nature, extent and quality of\nthe services to be provided by the Advisor and determined that such services continue to\nmeet the needs of the Fund and its stockholders. The Board reviewed the services provided\nto the Fund by the Advisor as compared to services provided by other advisers that manage\ninvestment companies with investment objectives, strategies and policies similar to those\nof the Fund, the Advisor’s history and experience providing investment services to the\nFund, and its knowledge of the closed-end fund industry. The Board concluded that the\nnature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Advisor were appropriate and\nconsistent with the terms of the Advisory Agreement, that the quality of those services\nhad been consistent with industry norms and that the Fund was likely to benefit from the\ncontinued provision of those services. The Board also concluded that the Advisor had\nsufficient personnel, with the appropriate education and experience, to serve the Fund\neffectively and had demonstrated an ability to retain qualified personnel.\nBoth at the meeting and on an ongoing basis throughout the year, the Board considered and\nevaluated the investment performance of the Fund and reviewed the Fund’s performance\nrelative to other investment companies and funds investing in emerging markets, Latin\nAmerica, and foreign issuers. The Board considered performance of the Fund, noting\nthat the Fund’s net asset value performance was reasonable compared to funds used in\nthe comparative data for the six-month and twelve-month periods ended June 30, 2023,\nbut noted that there were no other funds focused on the Caribbean Basin region. The\nBoard concluded that the performance of the Fund was within an acceptable range of\nperformance relative to other funds used in the comparisons.\n- 39 -\nDiscussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment\nAdvisory Agreement (unaudited) (continued)\nThe Board considered the costs of the services provided by the Advisor, the compensation\nand benefits received by the Advisor as a result of providing services to the Fund, as well\nas the Advisor’s profitability. The Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor\nby the Fund and relevant comparable fee data and statistics of Latin American-specialist\nand small foreign equity funds. The Board noted that there are no funds with which to\nmake a direct comparison because of the Fund’s unique strategy. The Board also noted\nthat the Fund is smaller than many Latin American regional funds, and therefore its\ntotal expense ratio is higher than funds presented in the comparison. The Board further\ndiscussed the services provided by the Advisor and concluded that the advisory services\nperformed were satisfactory and that the fee charged was reasonable and not excessive.\nThe Board concluded that the Advisor’s fees and profits derived from its relationship with\nthe Fund in light of its expenses, were reasonable in relation to the nature, quality and\nextent of the services provided, taking into account the fees charged by other advisers for\nmanaging comparable funds.\nThe Board also considered the extent to which economies of scale would be realized\nrelative to fee levels as the Fund grows, and whether the advisory fee levels reflect these\neconomies of scale for the benefit of stockholders. The Board recognized that because\nof the closed-end structure of the Fund, this particular factor is less relevant to the Fund\nthan it would typically be to an open-end fund. The Board also discussed the anticipated\nadditional assets in the Fund as a result of the upcoming rights offering. The Board\ndiscussed that the potential for the Fund to achieve economies of scale was limited because\nthe Fund is a closed-end fund.\nThe Board also considered in its deliberations the Advisor’s services and performance as\ndiscussed during regular Board meetings held throughout the year, including the Board’s\ndiscussion of the Fund’s investment objective, long-term performance, investment style\nand process. The Board noted the high level of diligence with which it reviews and\nevaluates the Advisor throughout the year and the extensive information provided with\nrespect to the Advisor’s performance and the Fund’s expenses on a quarterly basis. The\nBoard also considered whether any events occurred or whether additional information\nor data was necessary for their review that would constitute a reason not to renew the\nAgreement and concluded there were not.\nAfter further consideration of the factors discussed above and information presented at\nthe August 10, 2023 meeting and at previous meetings of the Board, the Board and the\nIndependent Directors determined to continue the Advisory Agreement for an additional\none-year period. In arriving at its decision, the Board and the Independent Directors did\nnot identify any single matter, factor or consideration as controlling.\n- 40 -\nOfficers and Directors\nOfficers\nERIK M.
