MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nNot applicable.\nThe following discussion also should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes\nthereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors,\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere herein, our actual results may differ materially from\nthose anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe are a global biopharmaceutical company on a mission to transform the lives of patients with serious and rare\ndiseases. Our first commercial product, ARIKAYCE, was approved in the US in September 2018, in the EU in October 2020\nand in Japan in March 2021. Our pipeline includes clinical-stage programs, brensocatib and TPIP, as well as other early-stage\nresearch programs. Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we are developing for the\ntreatment of patients with bronchiectasis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases, including CRSsNP. TPIP is an inhaled\nformulation of the treprostinil prodrug treprostinil palmitil which may offer a differentiated product profile for PH-ILD and\nPAH. Our early-stage research programs encompass a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy,\nartificial intelligence-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA-end joining, and synthetic rescue. We have legal\nentities in the US, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and Japan.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" for a summary of our ongoing commercial and clinical programs for ARIKAYCE\nand our ongoing clinical activities for brensocatib, TPIP and early-stage research programs.\nPrior to 2019, we had not generated significant revenue and through December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated\ndeficit of $3.4 billion. We have financed our operations primarily through the public offerings of our equity securities, debt\nfinancings and revenue interest financings. Although it is difficult to predict our future funding requirements, based upon our\ncurrent operating plan, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 will\nenable us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur ability to reduce our operating loss and begin to generate positive cash flow from operations depends on the\ncontinued success in commercializing ARIKAYCE and achieving positive results from the ARIKAYCE confirmatory clinical\ntrial program in order to obtain full approval of ARIKAYCE in the US and potentially reach more patients. Additionally, our\ncontinued success also depends on bringing additional clinical stage products to market, such as brensocatib, TPIP and our\nearly-stage research programs. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development\nactivities as we continue the ARIKAYCE confirmatory clinical program, conduct the Phase 3 ASPEN trial for brensocatib,\ncontinue the trials for TPIP, and fund development of our early-stage research programs. We also expect to continue to incur\nsignificant costs related to the commercialization of ARIKAYCE and our pre-commercialization activities related to\nbrensocatib. Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of\nARIKAYCE; the scope and progress of our research and development efforts; and the timing of certain expenses. We cannot\npredict whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such\napproval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such products and whether or when they may\nbecome profitable.\nKEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProduct Revenues, Net\nProduct revenues, net, consist of net sales of ARIKAYCE. In October 2018, we began shipping ARIKAYCE to our\ncustomers in the US, which include specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors. In December 2020, we began commercial\nsales of ARIKAYCE in Europe. In July 2021, we began recognizing product revenue from commercial sales of ARIKAYCE in\nJapan. We recognize revenue for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits, including prompt\npay discounts, service fees, estimated rebates, including government rebates, such as Medicaid rebates and Medicare Part D\ncoverage gap reimbursements in the US, and chargebacks.\nCost of Product Revenues (Excluding Amortization of Intangible Assets)\nCost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) consist primarily of direct and indirect costs\nrelated to the manufacturing of ARIKAYCE sold, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight, and\nallocation of overhead costs, in addition to royalty expenses and revenue-based milestones.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1999, but we are unable to determine the specific year.

We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nIselin, New Jersey\nFebruary 22, 2024\n85\n86\nINSMED INCORPORATED INSMED INCORPORATED\nConsolidated Balance Sheets

For these PSUs, there are two\nperformance conditions, a service condition, and a market condition. The performance conditions are the issuance of a press\nrelease announcing certain top-line results from a clinical trial and the acceptance of an NDA by the FDA for brensocatib. The\nservice condition is continuous employment with the Company through the later of the third anniversary of the grant date of the\nPSU award and the date an NDA for brensocatib is accepted by the FDA. The potential payout of the awards ranges from 0% to\n250% of the target, dependent on a market condition that is based on the Company's total shareholder return compared to a\ndefined peer group. Due to the multiple vesting conditions, uncertain timing and variable payout of these PSUs, a Monte Carlo\nsimulation was performed to determine the fair value of the awards. Compensation cost will be recognized on the date the\nperformance conditions become probable, with an initial recording of the cumulative expense that would have been recognized\nif the PSU expense had been recognized on a straight-line basis since the date of grant. The remaining unamortized fair value of\nthe awards will then be expensed prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. Since the market\ncondition is reflected in the grant-date fair value and is not a condition for the award to vest, it does not impact the requisite\nservice period. The volatility, risk-free interest rate and weighted-average grant date fair value of the PSUs granted are 65.4%,\n1.03% and $39.12, respectively. Any forfeitures that occur after compensation cost recognition commences will result in the\ncumulative reversal of expense in the period in which the forfeiture occurs. As of December 31, 2023, there were 266,550 PSUs\noutstanding with an unrecognized compensation expense of $10.4 million, which assumes a payout of 100% of the target.\n115 116\nINSMED INCORPORATED INSMED INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.
