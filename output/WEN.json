He will report to President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk Tanner and serve on the Wendy's Senior Leadership Team. Cook will succeed Gunther Plosch who has served as Chief Financial Officer since 2016 and will depart the Company at the end of the year after a transition with Cook.\n\n[ ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/330586/the_wendys_company_logo.html)\n\nCook most recently served as Head of Financial Planning and Analysis at United Parcel Service and joins Wendy's with 20 years of experience in roles with increasing responsibility across the Finance organization. In prior roles at UPS, Cook served as Chief Financial Officer for the U.S. Domestic segment, leading the financial planning and execution for the company's largest business unit, and previously held leadership roles in Investor Relations and Treasury, along with more than three years as the CFO of South Asia.\n\n\"Driving operational performance and improving restaurant profitability are critical to our growth trajectory,\" said President and CEO Kirk Tanner. \"Ken will play a key role across our initiatives to increase revenue and expand margins as we enter the next phase of growth in the U.S. and around the globe, helping to unlock value for our shareholders. I want to thank GP for his work to improve our system's financial foundations and processes that have created a stronger organization and positioned us to build momentum.\"\n\n\"I am excited for the opportunity to lead the Finance organization of Wendy's as this iconic brand embarks on an accelerated growth journey,\" said Ken Cook. \"I look forward to working with the talented Wendy's system and franchise community to drive profitable growth for our restaurants, teams, and shareowners.\"\n\nThe Company will release its fourth quarter and full year 2024 results on February 13, 2025 and as previously announced, will host an Investor Day on March 5, 2025.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This release contains certain statements that are not historical facts, including statements regarding our anticipated future performance and growth.

These were partially\noffset by lower Company-operated restaurant sales.\nU.S. Company-Operated Restaurant Margin\nU.S. Company-operated restaurant margin remained flat to the prior year. The impact of a\nhigher average check and labor efficiencies was offset by labor rate inflation and customer\ncount declines.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was primarily driven by an increase in\nemployee compensation and benefits and an increase in professional fees. These were\npartially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation accruals.\nOperating Profit\nThe decrease in operating profit resulted primarily from an increase in the Company’s\nincremental investment in breakfast advertising, higher general and administrative expense,\nand higher depreciation. These were partially offset by higher franchise royalty revenue, higher\nother operating income, and higher franchise net rental income.\nNet Income\nThe decrease in net income resulted primarily from a decrease in operating profit and a higher\neffective tax rate.\n2\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe decrease in adjusted EBITDA resulted primarily from the Company’s incremental\ninvestment in breakfast advertising and higher general administrative expense, partially offset\nby an increase in franchise royalty revenue, higher other operating income, and higher\nfranchise net rental income.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\nThe decrease in adjusted earnings per share was driven by a decrease in adjusted EBITDA, an\nincrease in depreciation and a higher effective tax rate. These were partially offset by fewer\nshares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchase program.\nYear to Date Free Cash Flow\nThe increase in free cash flow resulted primarily from a decrease in cash paid for cloud\ncomputing arrangements and a decrease in capital expenditures. These were partially offset by\nthe Company’s incremental investment in breakfast advertising.\nCompany Declares Quarterly Dividend\nThe Company announced today the declaration of its regular quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents\nper share. The dividend is payable on December 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of\nDecember 2, 2024. The number of common shares outstanding as of October 24, 2024 was\napproximately 203.8 million.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company repurchased 1.5 million shares for $25.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. In the\nfourth quarter of 2024, the Company has repurchased 0.2 million shares for $2.7 million through\nOctober 24. As of October 24, approximately $247.7 million remains available under the\nCompany’s existing share repurchase authorization that expires in February 2027.\n2024 Outlook\nThis release includes forward-looking projections for certain non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding systemwide sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.\nThe Company excludes certain expenses and benefits from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings\nper share and free cash flow, such as the impact from our advertising funds, including the net\nchange in the restricted operating assets and liabilities and any excess or deficit of advertising fund\nrevenues over advertising fund expenses, impairment of long-lived assets, reorganization and\nrealignment costs, system optimization gains, net, amortization of cloud computing arrangements,\ngain on early extinguishment of debt, net, and the timing and resolution of certain tax matters. Due\nto the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of those expenses and benefits, the\nCompany is unable without unreasonable effort to provide projections of net income, earnings per\nshare or net cash provided by operating activities, or a reconciliation of those projected measures.\nDuring 2024 the Company Now Expects:\n• Global systemwide sales growth: ~3 percent\n• Adjusted earnings per share: $0.99 to $1.01\nIn Addition, the Company Continues to Expect:\n• Adjusted EBITDA: $535 to $545 million\n• Cash flows from operations: $365 to $385 million\n• Capital expenditures: $90 to $100 million\n• Free cash flow: $275 to $285 million\n3\nConference Call and Webcast Scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Today, October 31\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, October 31 at 8:30 a.m. ET, with a\nsimultaneous webcast from the Company’s Investor Relations website at www.irwendys.com.

Generally, forward-\nlooking statements include the words “may,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,”\n“estimate,” “goal,” “upcoming,” “outlook,” “guidance” or the negation thereof, or similar expressions.\nIn addition, all statements that address future operating, financial or business performance,\nstrategies or initiatives, future efficiencies or savings, anticipated costs or charges, future\ncapitalization, anticipated impacts of recent or pending investments or transactions and statements\nexpressing general views about future results or brand health are forward-looking statements\nwithin the meaning of the Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s\nexpectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and\nare susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. For all such forward-looking\nstatements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements\ncontained in the Reform Act. The Company’s actual results, performance and achievements may\ndiffer materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the\nCompany’s forward-looking statements.\nMany important factors could affect the Company’s future results and cause those results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or implied by the Company’s forward-looking statements. Such\nfactors include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the impact of competition or poor customer\nexperiences at Wendy’s restaurants; (2) adverse economic conditions or disruptions, including in\nregions with a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants; (3) changes in discretionary consumer\nspending and consumer tastes and preferences; (4) the disruption to the Company’s business from\nCOVID-19 and its impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects; (5) impacts to the Company’s corporate reputation or the value and perception of the\nCompany’s brand; (6) the effectiveness of the Company’s marketing and advertising programs and\nnew product development; (7) the Company’s ability to manage the impact of social media; (8) the\nCompany’s ability to protect its intellectual property; (9) food safety events or health concerns\ninvolving the Company’s products; (10) our ability to deliver accelerated global sales growth and\nachieve or maintain market share across our dayparts; (11) the Company’s ability to achieve its\ngrowth strategy through new restaurant development and its Image Activation program; (12) the\nCompany’s ability to effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants or\nsuccessfully implement other strategic initiatives; (13) risks associated with leasing and owning\nsignificant amounts of real estate, including environmental matters; (14) risks associated with the\nCompany’s international operations, including the ability to execute its international growth\nstrategy; (15) changes in commodity and other operating costs; (16) shortages or interruptions in\n4\nthe supply or distribution of the Company’s products and other risks associated with the\nCompany’s independent supply chain purchasing co-op; (17) the impact of increased labor costs\nor labor shortages; (18) the continued succession and retention of key personnel and the\neffectiveness of the Company’s leadership and organizational structure; (19) risks associated with\nthe Company’s digital commerce strategy, platforms and technologies, including its ability to adapt\nto changes in industry trends and consumer preferences; (20) the Company’s dependence on\ncomputer systems and information technology, including risks associated with the failure or\ninterruption of its systems or technology or the occurrence of cyber incidents or deficiencies; (21)\nrisks associated with the Company’s securitized financing facility and other debt agreements,\nincluding compliance with operational and financial covenants, restrictions on its ability to raise\nadditional capital, the impact of its overall debt levels and the Company’s ability to generate\nsufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations and operate its business; (22) risks\nassociated with the Company’s capital allocation policy, including the amount and timing of equity\nand debt repurchases and dividend payments; (23) risks associated with complaints and litigation,\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements and an increased focus on environmental,\nsocial and governance issues; (24) risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance,\nchanges in accounting standards, the recognition of impairment or other charges, changes in tax\nrates or tax laws and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (25) conditions beyond the\nCompany’s control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest,\nhealth epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events; and (26) other risks and uncertainties\ncited in the Company’s releases, public statements and/or filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, including those identified in the “Risk Factors” sections of the Company’s Forms 10-K\nand 10-Q.\nIn addition to the factors described above, there are risks associated with the Company’s\npredominantly franchised business model that could impact its results, performance and\nachievements. Such risks include the Company’s ability to identify, attract and retain experienced\nand qualified franchisees, the Company's ability to effectively manage the transfer of restaurants\nbetween and among franchisees, the business and financial health of franchisees, the ability of\nfranchisees to meet their royalty, advertising, development, reimaging and other commitments,\nparticipation by franchisees in brand strategies and the fact that franchisees are independent third\nparties that own, operate and are responsible for overseeing the operations of their restaurants.\nThe Company’s predominantly franchised business model may also impact the ability of the\nWendy’s system to effectively respond and adapt to market changes.\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person\nacting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained\nor referred to above. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors that the\nCompany currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company\nto predict these events or how they may affect the Company.\nThe Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of\nthis release as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by\nfederal securities laws, although the Company may do so from time to time. The Company does\nnot endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nThere can be no assurance that any additional regular quarterly cash dividends will be declared or\npaid after the date hereof, or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. Future dividend\npayments, if any, are subject to applicable law, will be made at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors and will be based on factors such as the Company’s earnings, financial condition and\ncash requirements and other factors.\n5\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in this release, including adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per\nshare, free cash flow and systemwide sales.\nThe Company uses adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and\nsystemwide sales as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance\nmeasures for benchmarking against the Company’s peers and competitors. Adjusted EBITDA and\nsystemwide sales are also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes\nof executive compensation. The Company believes its presentation of adjusted revenue, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and systemwide sales provides a meaningful perspective of\nthe underlying operating performance of our current business and enables investors to better\nunderstand and evaluate our historical and prospective operating performance. The Company\nbelieves these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating\nperformance because they eliminate items that vary from period to period without correlation to our\ncore operating performance and highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature and/or size of the\nitems being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are\nnot indicative of our future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and\nother interested parties use adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and\nsystemwide sales in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a\ncomparative assessment of the Company’s operating performance in addition to the Company’s\nperformance based on GAAP results.\nThis release also includes disclosure regarding the Company’s free cash flow. Free cash flow is a\nnon-GAAP financial measure that is used by the Company as an internal measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow is also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes of\nexecutive compensation. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operations\nminus (i) capital expenditures and (ii) the net change in the restricted operating assets and\nliabilities of the advertising funds and any excess/deficit of advertising funds revenue over\nadvertising funds expense included in net income, as reported under GAAP. The impact of our\nadvertising funds is excluded because the funds are used solely for advertising and are not\navailable for the Company’s working capital needs. The Company may also make additional\nadjustments for certain non-recurring or unusual items to the extent identified in the reconciliation\ntables that accompany this release. The Company believes free cash flow is an important liquidity\nmeasure for investors and other interested persons because it communicates how much cash flow\nis available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing shares, paying dividends,\nrepaying or refinancing debt, financing possible acquisitions or investments or other uses of cash.\nAdjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and systemwide\nsales are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures does not replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results in\naccordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate adjusted revenue, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and systemwide sales (and similarly titled\nfinancial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be\nconsistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of\nthe Company’s performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the\n6\nreconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the\nnon-GAAP financial measures included herein.\nKey Business Measures\nThe Company tracks its results of operations and manages its business using certain key business\nmeasures, including same-restaurant sales, systemwide sales and Company-operated restaurant\nmargin, which are measures commonly used in the quick-service restaurant industry that are\nimportant to understanding Company performance.\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales each include sales by both Company-operated and\nfranchise restaurants. The Company reports same-restaurant sales for new restaurants after they\nhave been open for 15 continuous months and for reimaged restaurants as soon as they reopen.\nRestaurants temporarily closed for more than one fiscal week are excluded from same-restaurant\nsales.\nFranchise restaurant sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from\nsales at franchised Wendy’s restaurants. Sales by franchise restaurants are not recorded as\nCompany revenues and are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, the Company’s royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by\nWendy’s franchisees and, as a result, sales by franchisees have a direct effect on the Company’s\nroyalty revenues and profitability.\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Argentina due to the highly\ninflationary economy of that country.\nThe Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant\ncurrency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and\nare derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company\nbelieves excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year\ncomparability.\nU.S. Company-operated restaurant margin is defined as sales from U.S. Company-operated\nrestaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from U.S. Company-operated restaurants. Cost of\nsales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating\ncosts. Cost of sales excludes certain costs that support restaurant operations that are not allocated\nto individual restaurants, which are included in “General and administrative.” Cost of sales also\nexcludes depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of long-lived assets. Therefore,\nas restaurant margin as presented excludes certain costs as described above, its usefulness may\nbe limited and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our\nindustry.\nAbout Wendy’s\nWendy's® was founded in 1969 by Dave Thomas in Columbus, Ohio. Dave built his business on\nthe premise, “Quality is our Recipe®,” which remains the guidepost of the Wendy’s system.\nWendy’s is best known for its made-to-order square hamburgers, using fresh, never frozen beef*,\nfreshly-prepared salads, and other signature items like chili, baked potatoes and the Frosty®\ndessert. The Wendy’s Company (Nasdaq: WEN) is committed to doing the right thing and making\na positive difference in the lives of others. This is most visible through the Company's support of\nthe Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption® and its signature Wendy's Wonderful Kids® program,\nwhich seeks to find a loving, forever home for every child waiting to be adopted from the North\nAmerican foster care system. Today, Wendy’s and its franchisees employ hundreds of thousands\n7\nof people across over 7,000 restaurants worldwide with a vision of becoming the world’s most\nthriving and beloved restaurant brand.

Valuation techniques under the accounting guidance related\nto fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data\nfrom independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs are classified into the\nfollowing hierarchy:\n• Level 1 Inputs - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose\nsignificant value drivers are observable.\n• Level 3 Inputs - Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little,\nif any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments:\nSeptember 29, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair Fair Value\nAmount Value Amount Value Measurements\nFinancial assets\nCash equivalents $ 333,761 $ 333,761 $ 365,901 $ 365,901 Level 1\nOther investments in equity securities (a) 1,718 1,718 1,718 1,718 Level 2\nFinancial liabilities (b)\nSeries 2022-1 Class A-2-I Notes 97,750 95,635 98,500 92,289 Level 2\nSeries 2022-1 Class A-2-II Notes 387,134 367,777 390,134 370,577 Level 2\nSeries 2021-1 Class A-2-I Notes 419,894 379,609 423,269 362,572 Level 2\nSeries 2021-1 Class A-2-II Notes 628,655 553,411 633,530 530,581 Level 2\nSeries 2019-1 Class A-2-I Notes 354,673 348,204 357,673 341,606 Level 2\nSeries 2019-1 Class A-2-II Notes 399,748 388,131 403,123 374,058 Level 2\nSeries 2018-1 Class A-2-II Notes 437,537 425,767 441,099 412,754 Level 2\n7% debentures, due in 2025 48,744 49,586 48,237 49,431 Level 2\n_______________\n(a) The fair value of our other investments in equity securities is based on our review of information provided by the\ninvestment manager, which is based on observable price changes in orderly transactions for a similar investment of the\nsame issuer.\n(b) The fair values were based on quoted market prices in markets that are not considered active markets.\nThe carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature\nof those items.

The fair values of long-lived assets held and used presented in the tables below represent the remaining carrying\nvalue and were estimated based on either discounted cash flows of future anticipated lease and sublease income or discounted\ncash flows of future anticipated Company-operated restaurant performance.

The Company’s effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the three months\nended September 29, 2024 primarily due to state income taxes and the tax effects of our foreign operations.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 was 27.3% and\n25.8%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the nine months\nended September 29, 2024 primarily due to state income taxes and the tax effects of our foreign operations.\nThere were no significant changes to the unrecognized tax benefits or related interest and penalties for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 29, 2024. During the next twelve months, we believe it is reasonably possible the Company will\nreduce unrecognized tax benefits by up to $220 due to lapses of statutes of limitations.\nThe current portion of refundable income taxes was $9,307 and $5,284 as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and is included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net.” There were no long-term refundable income taxes as of\nSeptember 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n(9) Net Income Per Share\nThe calculation of basic and diluted net income per share was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 50,224 $ 58,049 $ 146,860 $ 157,502\nCommon stock:\nWeighted average basic shares outstanding 203,264 208,834 204,518 210,668\nDilutive effect of stock options and restricted\nshares 990 1,768 1,285 2,185\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 204,254 210,602 205,803 212,853\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ .25 $ .28 $ .72 $ .75\nDiluted $ .25 $ .28 $ .71 $ .74\nBasic net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 was computed by\ndividing net income amounts by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income per\nshare was computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding plus the potential\ncommon share effect of dilutive stock options and restricted shares. We excluded potential common shares of 8,605 and 7,667\nfor the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 5,204 and 4,719 for the three and nine months ended\nOctober 1, 2023, respectively, from our diluted net income per share calculation as they would have had anti-dilutive effects.\n(10) Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends\nDuring each of the first, second, and third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the Company paid dividends per share of $.25.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nIn January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $500,000 of our common stock through\nFebruary 28, 2027, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible (the “January 2023\n18\nTable of Contents\nTHE WENDY’S COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)\nAuthorization”).

Wendy’s paid TimWen $16,065 and $15,713 under these\nlease agreements during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, which is recorded to\n“Franchise rental expense.” In addition, TimWen paid Wendy’s a management fee under the TimWen joint venture agreement\nof $179 and $181 during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, which is included as a\nreduction to “General and administrative.”\nTransactions with QSCC\nWendy’s has a purchasing co-op relationship structure with its franchisees that establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op,\nInc. (“QSCC”). QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of\nfood, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system\nvolume. QSCC’s supply chain management facilitates continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies\nwhile monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy’s supply chain in the U.S. and\nCanada.\n21\nTable of Contents\nTHE WENDY’S COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)\nWendy’s and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing\nfees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC’s operations. In addition, QSCC\ncollects certain rebates, price variance and other recoveries, technology fees, convention fees and other funding from third-party\nvendors as part of the administration and management of the Wendy’s supply chain in the U.S. and Canada. Should QSCC’s\nsourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC’s board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the\nform of a patronage dividend. Wendy’s recorded its share of patronage dividends of $3,493 during the nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, of which $2,909 is included in “Other operating income, net” and $584 is included as a reduction of “Cost\nof sales.” Wendy’s recorded its share of patronage dividends of $363 during the nine months ended October 1, 2023, all of\nwhich is included as a reduction of “Cost of sales.”\nTransactions with Yellow Cab\nCertain family members and/or affiliates of Mr. Nelson Peltz, our former Chairman, Mr. Peter May, our Senior Vice\nChairman, and Mr. Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, hold minority ownership interests in Yellow Cab Holdings, LLC\n(“Yellow Cab”), a Wendy’s franchisee, that as of September 29, 2024 owns and operates 87 Wendy’s restaurants, and/or certain\nof the operating companies managed by Yellow Cab. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023,\nthe Company recognized $11,397 and $11,143, respectively, in royalty, advertising fund, lease and other income from Yellow\nCab and related entities. In all transactions involving Yellow Cab, the Company’s standard franchisee recruiting and approval\nprocesses were followed, no modifications were made to the Company’s standard franchise agreements or related documents,\nand all deal terms and transaction documents were negotiated and executed on an arm’s-length basis, consistent with the\nCompany’s comparable franchise transactions and relationships. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1,099\nand $1,153, respectively, was due from Yellow Cab for such income, which is included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net”\nand “Advertising funds restricted assets.”\nTransactions with AMC\nIn February 2023, Ms. Kristin Dolan, a director of the Company, was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of AMC\nNetworks Inc. (“AMC”). During the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the Company purchased\napproximately $1,600 and $1,800, respectively, of advertising time from a subsidiary of AMC. The Company’s advertising\nspend with AMC was made in the ordinary course of business and approved on an arm’s-length basis, consistent with the\nCompany’s comparable advertising decisions. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $584 was due to AMC for such\nadvertising time, which is included in “Advertising funds restricted liabilities.” There were no amounts due to AMC as of\nSeptember 29, 2024.\n(14) Guarantees and Other Commitments and Contingencies\nExcept as described below, the Company did not have any significant changes in guarantees and other commitments and\ncontingencies during the current fiscal period since those reported in the Form 10-K. Refer to the Form 10-K for further\ninformation regarding the Company’s additional commitments and obligations.\nFranchisee Incentive Programs\nTo promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying\nnew restaurants. In July and September 2024, Wendy’s announced a new development incentive structure in the U.S. and\nCanada and select international markets, respectively, that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising fees for\nqualifying new restaurants for two, three or four years of operation based on the number of restaurants committed to under the\ndevelopment agreement.\nLease Guarantees\nWendy’s has guaranteed the performance of certain leases and other obligations, primarily from former Company-operated\nrestaurant locations now operated by franchisees, amounting to $86,450 as of September 29, 2024. These leases extend through\n2045. We have had no judgments against us as guarantor of these leases as of September 29, 2024. In the event of default by a\nfranchise owner where Wendy’s is called upon to perform under its guarantee, Wendy’s has the ability to pursue repayment\nfrom the franchise owner. The liability recorded for our probable exposure associated with these lease guarantees was not\nmaterial as of September 29, 2024.\n22\nTable of Contents\nTHE WENDY’S COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)\nLetters of Credit\nAs of September 29, 2024, the Company had outstanding letters of credit with various parties totaling $28,673.\nSubstantially all of the outstanding letters of credit include amounts outstanding against the 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior\nSecured Notes, Class A-1. We do not expect any material loss to result from these letters of credit.\nPurchase and Capital Commitments\nThe Company has material purchase requirements under a marketing agreement with two national broadcasters and a\nbeverage agreement with a vendor. In August 2024, the Company amended its contract with the beverage vendor, which now\nexpires upon reaching a threshold usage requirement or, if certain undertakings are not fulfilled, at the later of reaching a\nthreshold usage requirement or December 31, 2034. Our total purchase requirements under the marketing agreement and the\namended beverage agreement are estimated to be approximately $107,500 over the remaining life of the contracts.\n(15) Legal and Environmental Matters\nThe Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and\nclaims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company\nbelieves it has adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible\nrange of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being\nin preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and significant factual\nmatters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.\nPredicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult and future\ndevelopments could cause these actions or claims, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of a particular reporting period.\n(16) Segment Information\nRevenues by segment are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWendy’s U.S. $ 468,725 $ 457,240 $ 1,384,163 $ 1,366,981\nWendy’s International 37,598 35,167 106,774 97,162\nGlobal Real Estate & Development 60,416 58,148 181,282 176,784\nTotal revenues $ 566,739 $ 550,555 $ 1,672,219 $ 1,640,927\n23\nTable of Contents\nTHE WENDY’S COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)\nThe following table reconciles profit by segment to the Company’s consolidated income before income taxes:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWendy’s U.S. (a) $ 129,790 $ 134,887 $ 392,323 $ 403,064\nWendy’s International (b) 11,046 10,831 32,411 26,808\nGlobal Real Estate & Development 27,237 24,418 79,480 76,020\nTotal segment profit 168,073 170,136 $ 504,214 $ 505,892\nUnallocated franchise support and other costs (900) (29) (1,117) (6)\nAdvertising funds deficit 190 1,088 651 3,509\nUnallocated general and administrative (c) (32,443) (30,962) (98,289) (96,776)\nDepreciation and amortization (exclusive of\namortization of cloud computing arrangements\nshown separately below) (36,996) (34,288) (110,006) (101,258)\nAmortization of cloud computing arrangements (3,576) (3,844) (10,637) (7,692)\nSystem optimization gains, net 420 120 573 119\nReorganization and realignment costs (354) (611) (8,479) (8,100)\nImpairment of long-lived assets (178) (59) (2,873) (513)\nUnallocated other operating income, net 439 52 1,301 180\nInterest expense, net (31,270) (30,957) (92,800) (93,798)\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt — (319) — (1,585)\nInvestment income (loss), net — — 11 (10,389)\nOther income, net 6,246 7,637 19,382 22,546\nIncome before income taxes $ 69,651 $ 77,964 $ 201,931 $ 212,129\n_______________\n(a) Wendy’s U.S. includes advertising funds expense of $5,977 and $13,386 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 related to the Company’s funding of incremental advertising.\n(b) Wendy’s International includes advertising funds expense of $622 and $1,387 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, respectively, and $596 and $1,802 for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023,\nrespectively, related to the Company’s funding of incremental advertising in Canada.

The amendment requires a lessee in a\ncommon-control lease arrangement to amortize leasehold improvements that it owns over the useful life of the improvements to\nthe common-control group, regardless of the lease term, if the lessee continues to control the use of the underlying asset through\na lease. The Company adopted this amendment during the first quarter of 2024. The adoption of this amendment did not have\na material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\n24\nItem 2.

See “Results of Operations” below and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements contained in Item 1 herein for segment financial information.\nThe Company’s fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. All\nthree- and nine-month periods presented herein contain 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. All references to years, quarters\nand months relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nAs of September 29, 2024, the Wendy’s restaurant system was comprised of 7,292 restaurants, with 6,011 Wendy’s\nrestaurants in operation in the U.S. Of the U.S. restaurants, 398 were operated by the Company and 5,613 were operated by a\ntotal of 210 franchisees. In addition, at September 29, 2024, there were 1,281 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in 31 foreign\ncountries and U.S. territories. Of the international restaurants, 1,268 were operated by a total of 109 franchisees and 13 were\noperated by the Company in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).\nThe revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated\nrestaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise\nfees received from Wendy’s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5% of the total\nWendy’s system as of September 29, 2024.\nWendy’s operating results are impacted by a number of external factors, including commodity costs, labor costs, intense\nprice competition, unemployment and consumer spending levels, general economic and market trends and weather.\nWendy’s long-term growth opportunities include delivering accelerated global growth through (1) driving same-restaurant\nsales momentum across all dayparts, (2) accelerating our consumer-facing digital platforms and technologies and (3) expanding\nthe Company’s footprint across the globe.\nKey Business Measures\nWe track our results of operations and manage our business using the following key business measures, which includes a\nnon-GAAP financial measure:\n• Same-Restaurant Sales - We report same-restaurant sales commencing after new restaurants have been open for 15\ncontinuous months and as soon as reimaged restaurants reopen. Restaurants temporarily closed for more than one\nweek are excluded from same-restaurant sales. This methodology is consistent with the metric used by our\nmanagement for internal reporting and analysis. The table summarizing same-restaurant sales below in “Results of\nOperations” provides the same-restaurant sales percent changes.\n• Company-Operated Restaurant Margin - We define Company-operated restaurant margin as sales from Company-\noperated restaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from Company-operated restaurants. Cost of sales includes\nfood and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating costs. Cost of sales excludes certain\ncosts that support restaurant operations that are not allocated to individual restaurants, which are included in “General\nand administrative.” Cost of sales also excludes depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of long-lived\nassets. Therefore, as Company-operated restaurant margin as presented excludes certain costs as described above, its\nusefulness may be limited and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our\nindustry.\nCompany-operated restaurant margin is influenced by factors such as price increases, the effectiveness of our\nadvertising and marketing initiatives, featured products, product mix, fluctuations in food and labor costs, restaurant\nopenings, remodels and closures and the level of our fixed and semi-variable costs.\n• Systemwide Sales - Systemwide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes sales by both Company-\noperated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Franchised restaurants’ sales are reported by our franchisees and\nrepresent their revenues from sales at franchised Wendy’s restaurants. The Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements do not include sales by franchised restaurants to their customers. The Company’s royalty and advertising\n26\nfunds revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by Wendy’s franchisees. As a result, sales by Wendy’s\nfranchisees have a direct effect on the Company’s royalty and advertising funds revenues and profitability.\nThe Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant currency basis. Constant\ncurrency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and are derived by translating current year results at prior\nyear average exchange rates. The Company believes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year\nover year comparability.\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Argentina due to that country’s highly inflationary\neconomy. The Company considers economies that have had cumulative inflation in excess of 100% over a three-year period as\nhighly inflationary.\nThe Company believes its presentation of same-restaurant sales, Company-operated restaurant margin and systemwide\nsales provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company’s current business and enables\ninvestors to better understand and evaluate the Company’s historical and prospective operating performance. The Company\nbelieves that these metrics are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the\nCompany’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company\nbelieves investors, analysts and other interested parties use these metrics in evaluating issuers and that the presentation of these\nmeasures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company’s operating performance.

The Company does not expect to incur any material additional\ncosts under these plans.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nImpairment of long-lived assets $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 2.9 $ 0.5 $ 2.4\nThe increase in impairment of long-lived assets during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to higher\nimpairment charges as a result of the deterioration in operating performance of certain Company-operated restaurants.\nOther Operating Income, Net Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nLease buyout $ 1.7 $ (0.2) $ 1.9 $ 2.2 $ (0.2) $ 2.4\nEquity in earnings in joint venture, net 3.1 3.0 0.1 8.6 8.0 0.6\nOther, net 0.3 0.3 — 0.6 1.6 (1.0)\n$ 5.1 $ 3.1 $ 2.0 $ 11.4 $ 9.4 $ 2.0\nThe increase in other operating income during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to an\nincrease in lease buyout activity.\nInterest Expense, Net Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInterest expense, net $ 31.3 $ 31.0 $ 0.3 $ 92.8 $ 93.8 $ (1.0)\nThe decrease in interest expense, net during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower outstanding long-term\ndebt.\n35\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt $ — $ 0.3 $ (0.3) $ — $ 1.6 $ (1.6)\nDuring the first nine months of 2023, the Company incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.6 million related\nto the repurchase of $39.3 million in principal of the Company’s 7% debentures.\nInvestment Loss, Net Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInvestment loss, net $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 10.4 $ (10.4)\nDuring the first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $10.4 million due to impairment charges for the\ndifference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an investment in equity securities.\nOther Income, Net Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOther income, net $ 6.3 $ 7.7 $ (1.4) $ 19.4 $ 22.5 $ (3.1)\nThe decrease in other income, net during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease\nin interest income, reflecting lower balances of cash equivalents.\nProvision for Income Taxes Third Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nIncome before income taxes $ 69.7 $ 78.0 $ (8.3) $ 201.9 $ 212.1 $ (10.2)\nProvision for income taxes (19.5) (20.0) 0.5 (55.0) (54.6) (0.4)\nEffective tax rate on income 27.9 % 25.5 % 2.4 % 27.3 % 25.8 % 1.5 %\nThe effective tax rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were impacted by variations in\nincome before income taxes, adjusted for recurring items such as non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, as well as\nnon-recurring discrete items. The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to (1) an\nincrease in the tax effects of our foreign operations, (2) a decrease in the benefit from share-based compensation and (3) an\nincrease in state income taxes, including discrete changes to state deferred income taxes. The increase in the effective tax rate\nfor the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1) an increase in the tax effects of our foreign operations and (2) a\ndecrease in the benefit from share-based compensation. These changes were partially offset by a one-time adjustment to our\nforeign deferred income taxes related to prior periods.\nNumerous countries have enacted the Organization of Economic Corporation and Development’s framework on a global\nminimum tax (referred to as “Pillar 2”), with the earliest effective date for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023.\nWhile the Company does not expect this enactment will have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, we will continue to evaluate and monitor as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.\n36\nSegment Information\nSee Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 herein for further information\nregarding the Company’s segments.\nWendy’s U.S.\nThird Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nSales $ 222.7 $ 227.7 $ (5.0) $ 673.4 $ 685.2 $ (11.8)\nFranchise royalty revenue 114.4 112.7 1.7 341.2 334.0 7.2\nFranchise fees 17.9 17.0 0.9 53.5 51.8 1.7\nAdvertising fund revenue 113.7 99.8 13.9 316.1 296.0 20.1\nTotal revenues $ 468.7 $ 457.2 $ 11.5 $ 1,384.2 $ 1,367.0 $ 17.2\nSegment profit $ 129.8 $ 134.9 $ (5.1) $ 392.3 $ 403.1 $ (10.8)\nThe increase in Wendy’s U.S. revenues during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to (1)\nhigher advertising fund revenue and (2) net new franchise restaurant development. During the first nine months of 2024,\nrevenues also increased due to higher franchise same-restaurant sales. Franchise same-restaurant sales increased during the first\nnine months of 2024 primarily due to higher average check, partially offset by a decrease in customer count. These increases\nwere partially offset by a decrease in Company-operated sales driven by the same factors as described above for “Sales.”\nThe decrease in Wendy’s U.S. segment profit during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due\nto (1) an increase in the Company’s funding of incremental advertising and (2) a decrease in Company-operated sales. During\nthe first nine months of 2024, segment profit also decreased due to higher franchise support and other costs. These changes\nwere partially offset by an increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees.\nWendy’s International\nThird Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nSales $ 7.7 $ 7.1 $ 0.6 $ 19.7 $ 18.2 $ 1.5\nFranchise royalty revenue 18.2 17.4 0.8 53.4 50.4 3.0\nFranchise fees 2.3 1.6 0.7 6.6 4.5 2.1\nAdvertising fund revenue 9.4 9.1 0.3 27.1 24.1 3.0\nTotal revenues $ 37.6 $ 35.2 $ 2.4 $ 106.8 $ 97.2 $ 9.6\nSegment profit $ 11.0 $ 10.8 $ 0.2 $ 32.4 $ 26.8 $ 5.6\nThe increase in Wendy’s International revenues during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was primarily\ndue to (1) net new restaurant development and (2) an increase in franchise same-restaurant sales. Franchise same-restaurant\nsales increased during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 due to higher average check, partially offset by a\ndecrease in customer count.\nThe increase in Wendy’s International segment profit during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was\nprimarily due to higher revenues. This increase was partially offset by higher advertising fund expenses.\n37\nGlobal Real Estate & Development\nThird Quarter Nine Months\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nFranchise fees $ 1.1 $ 0.6 $ 0.5 $ 3.3 $ 3.4 $ (0.1)\nFranchise rental income 59.3 57.5 1.8 178.0 173.4 4.6\nTotal revenues $ 60.4 $ 58.1 $ 2.3 $ 181.3 $ 176.8 $ 4.5\nSegment profit $ 27.2 $ 24.4 $ 2.8 $ 79.5 $ 76.0 $ 3.5\nThe increase in Global Real Estate & Development revenues during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 was\nprimarily due to higher franchise rental income as a result of (1) amending certain existing leases, (2) entering into new leases\nand (3) an increase executory costs.\nThe increase in Global Real Estate & Development segment profit during the third quarter and the first nine months of\n2024 was primarily due to (1) higher revenues and (2) an increase in lease buyout activity. These increases were partially offset\nby higher franchise rental expense driven by the same factors as described above for “Franchise Rental Expense.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our securitized\nfinancing facility. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and\ndividends to stockholders.\nOur anticipated cash requirements for the remainder of 2024, exclusive of operating cash flow requirements, consist\nprincipally of:\n• capital expenditures of approximately $38.0 million to $48.0 million, resulting in total anticipated cash capital\nexpenditures for the year of approximately $90.0 million to $100.0 million;\n• cash dividends aggregating approximately $51.0 million as discussed below in “Dividends;” and\n• stock repurchases under the Company’s January 2023 Authorization as discussed below in “Stock Repurchases.”\nBased on current levels of operations, the Company expects that available cash and cash flows from operations will provide\nsufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nWe currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating\ncash requirements or for other purposes. However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available\nor available on terms acceptable to us.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the first nine months of\n2024 and 2023:\nNine Months\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 286.7 $ 269.5 $ 17.2\nInvesting activities (68.8) (55.5) (13.3)\nFinancing activities (250.6) (373.2) 122.6\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (1.6) 0.3 (1.9)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (34.3) $ (158.9) $ 124.6\n38\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation\nand amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash provided by operating activities was $286.7 million and $269.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a decrease in cash paid for cloud computing arrangements and (2) the timing\nof payments for marketing expenses of the national advertising funds. These changes were partially offset by lower net income,\nadjusted for non-cash expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $68.8 million and $55.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in expenditures associated with the Company’s franchise\ndevelopment fund of $19.1 million, partially offset by (1) a decrease in capital expenditures of $3.3 million and (2) an increase\nin proceeds from dispositions of $2.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $250.6 million and $373.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The change was primarily due to (1) a decrease in repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $82.4 million\nand (2) a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of $39.3 million, reflecting the impact of repurchases of the Company’s 7%\ndebentures during the first nine months of 2023.\nLong-Term Debt, Including Current Portion\nWe may from time to time seek to repurchase portions of our outstanding long-term debt, including our 7% debentures\nand/or our senior secured notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. No debt\nrepurchases were made during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. Future repurchases, if any, will depend on\nprevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Whether or not to\nrepurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion.\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s debt obligations since December 31, 2023. The Company was in\ncompliance with its debt covenants as of September 29, 2024.\nDividends\nOn March 15, 2024, June 17, 2024, and September 17, 2024, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends per share of $.25,\naggregating $153.4 million. On October 31, 2024, the Company announced a dividend of $.25 per share to be paid on\nDecember 16, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 2, 2024. As a result, the Company expects that its total cash\nrequirement for the fourth quarter of 2024 will be approximately $51.0 million based on the number of shares of its common\nstock outstanding at October 24, 2024. The Company currently intends to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends;\nhowever, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing\nof such dividends, if any.\nStock Repurchases\nIn January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of our common stock\nthrough February 28, 2027, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible (the “January 2023\nAuthorization”). During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company repurchased 3.4 million shares under the\nJanuary 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of $59.6 million, of which $0.2 million was accrued as of\nSeptember 29, 2024, and excluding excise tax and commissions. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had $250.4 million\nof availability remaining under the January 2023 Authorization. Subsequent to September 29, 2024 through October 24, 2024,\nthe Company repurchased 0.2 million shares under the January 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of $2.7\nmillion, excluding applicable excise tax and commissions.\n39\nGeneral Inflation, Commodities and Changing Prices\nInflationary pressures on labor directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during the nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, and we expect this to continue throughout the remainder of 2024. We attempt to manage any inflationary\ncosts and commodity price increases through selective menu price increases and product mix. Delays in implementing such\nmenu price increases and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in the future. Inherent\nvolatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains, could have a\nsignificant effect on our results of operations and may have an adverse effect on us in the future. The extent of any impact will\ndepend on our ability to manage such volatility through product mix and selective menu price increases.\nSeasonality\nWendy’s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy’s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the\nsummer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for a particular quarter are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nAs of September 29, 2024 there were no material changes from the information contained in the Company’s Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of\nSeptember 29, 2024. Based on such evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of\nSeptember 29, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company were effective at a reasonable assurance level in\n(1) recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company\nin the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and (2) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the\nCompany in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company during the third quarter of 2024 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the\npossible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not\nabsolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, the management of the\nCompany, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can\nprevent or detect all error or fraud. Finally, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to\nfuture periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity’s\noperating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n40\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company may\ncontain or incorporate by reference certain statements that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”). Generally, forward-looking statements include the words “may,”\n“believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimate,” “goal,” “upcoming,” “outlook,” “guidance” or the negation\nthereof, or similar expressions. In addition, all statements that address future operating, financial or business performance,\nstrategies or initiatives, future efficiencies or savings, anticipated costs or charges, future capitalization, anticipated impacts of\nrecent or pending investments or transactions and statements expressing general views about future results or brand health are\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are based on our expectations\nat the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks,\nuncertainties and other factors. For all of our forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for\nforward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. Our actual results, performance and achievements may differ\nmaterially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nMany important factors could affect our future results and cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in or\nimplied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• the impact of competition or poor customer experiences at Wendy’s restaurants;\n• adverse economic conditions or disruptions, including in regions with a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants;\n• changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer tastes and preferences;\n• the disruption to our business from COVID-19 and its impact on our results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects;\n• impacts to our corporate reputation or the value and perception of our brand;\n• the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and new product development;\n• our ability to manage the impact of social media;\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n• food safety events or health concerns involving our products;\n• our ability to deliver accelerated global sales growth and achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts;\n• our ability to achieve our growth strategy through new restaurant development and our Image Activation program;\n• our ability to effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants or successfully implement other\nstrategic initiatives;\n• risks associated with leasing and owning significant amounts of real estate, including environmental matters;\n• risks associated with our international operations, including our ability to execute our international growth strategy;\n• changes in commodity and other operating costs;\n• shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of our products and other risks associated with our independent\nsupply chain purchasing co-op;\n• the impact of increased labor costs or labor shortages;\n• the continued succession and retention of key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership and organizational\nstructure;\n41\n• risks associated with our digital commerce strategy, platforms and technologies, including our ability to adapt to\nchanges in industry trends and consumer preferences;\n• our dependence on computer systems and information technology, including risks associated with the failure or\ninterruption of our systems or technology or the occurrence of cyber incidents or deficiencies;\n• risks associated with our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, including compliance with\noperational and financial covenants, restrictions on our ability to raise additional capital, the impact of our overall debt\nlevels and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and operate our business;\n• risks associated with our capital allocation policy, including the amount and timing of equity and debt repurchases and\ndividend payments;\n• risks associated with complaints and litigation, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and an increased\nfocus on environmental, social and governance issues;\n• risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance, changes in accounting standards, the recognition of\nimpairment or other charges, changes in tax rates or tax laws and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• conditions beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health\nepidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events; and\n• other risks and uncertainties affecting us and our subsidiaries referred to in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed\nwith the SEC on February 26, 2024 (see especially “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) and in our other current and periodic filings with the\nSEC.\nIn addition to the factors described above, there are risks associated with our predominantly franchised business model that\ncould impact our results, performance and achievements. Such risks include our ability to identify, attract and retain\nexperienced and qualified franchisees, our ability to effectively manage the transfer of restaurants between and among\nfranchisees, the business and financial health of franchisees, the ability of franchisees to meet their royalty, advertising,\ndevelopment, reimaging and other commitments, participation by franchisees in brand strategies and the fact that franchisees\nare independent third parties that own, operate and are responsible for overseeing the operations of their restaurants. Our\npredominantly franchised business model may also impact the ability of the Wendy’s system to effectively respond and adapt to\nmarket changes.\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly\nqualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. New risks and uncertainties arise from\ntime to time, and factors that we currently deem immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for us to predict these\nevents or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by federal\nsecurities laws, although we may do so from time to time. We do not endorse any projections regarding future performance\nthat may be made by third parties.\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our business. We provide accruals for such litigation and\nclaims when we determine it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company\nbelieves it has adequate accruals for all of its legal and environmental matters. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range\nof loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in\npreliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual\nmatters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.\nPredicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult and future\ndevelopments could cause these actions or claims, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of a particular reporting period.\n42\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in our Form\n10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as described elsewhere in this\nreport, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nThe following table provides information with respect to repurchases of shares of our common stock by us and our\n“affiliated purchasers” (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024:\nIssuer Repurchases of Equity Securities\nTotal Number of Approximate Dollar\nShares Purchased Value of Shares\nAverage as Part of that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Price Paid Publicly Announced Purchased Under\nPeriod Shares Purchased (1) per Share Plans the Plans (2)\nJuly 1, 2024\nthrough 929,674 $16.76 929,002 $260,000,026\nAugust 4, 2024\nAugust 5, 2024\nthrough 427,124 $16.98 295,114 $255,002,053\nSeptember 1, 2024\nSeptember 2, 2024\nthrough 269,917 $17.31 268,290 $250,362,507\nSeptember 29, 2024\nTotal 1,626,715 $16.91 1,492,406 $250,362,507\n(1) Includes 134,309 shares of common stock reacquired by the Company from holders of share-based awards to satisfy\ncertain requirements associated with the vesting or exercise of the respective award. The shares were valued at the fair\nmarket value of the Company’s common stock on the vesting or exercise date of such awards, as set forth in the applicable\nplan document.\n(2) In January 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of our common stock\nthrough February 28, 2027, when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible.\nSubsequent to September 29, 2024 through October 24, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares under the\nJanuary 2023 Authorization with an aggregate purchase price of $2.7 million, excluding applicable excise tax and commissions.\n43\nItem 6.

          "content": "Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis website (including any materials and other information made available on this website) and\nother statements by The Wendy’s Company (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) might\ncontain or incorporate by reference certain statements that are not historical facts, including\ninformation concerning possible or assumed future results of operations or stated financial,\nbusiness or operational goals of the Company. Those statements, as well as statements preceded\nby, followed by, or that include the words “may,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,”\n“intends,” “estimate,” “goal,” “upcoming,” “outlook,” “guidance” or the negation thereof, or\nsimilar expressions, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Section 27A”), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Section 21E”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 (the “Reform Act”).\nThe forward-looking statements of the Company are intended to be covered by the safe harbors\ncreated under Section 27A and Section 21E. Furthermore, the Reform Act provides a “safe\nharbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective\ninformation, as long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied\nby cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking\nstatements of the Company are also intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the\nReform Act. In addition, all statements that address future operating, financial or business\nperformance, strategies or initiatives, future efficiencies or savings, anticipated costs or charges,\nfuture capitalization, anticipated impacts of recent or pending investments or transactions and\nstatements expressing general views about future results or brand health are forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of Section 27A, Section 21E and the Reform Act.\nThe forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s expectations at the time such\nstatements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number\nof risks, uncertainties and other factors. The Company’s actual results, performance and\nachievements may differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements\nexpressed in or implied by the Company’s forward-looking statements. For all of the Company’s\nforward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-\nlooking statements contained in Section 27A, Section 21E and the Reform Act.\nMany important factors could affect the Company’s future results and cause those results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or implied by the Company’s forward-looking statements.\nSuch factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the impact of competition or poor\ncustomer experiences at Wendy’s restaurants; (2) adverse economic conditions or disruptions,\nincluding in regions with a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants; (3) changes in discretionary\nconsumer spending and consumer tastes and preferences; (4) the disruption to the Company’s\nbusiness from COVID-19 and its impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial\ncondition and prospects; (5) impacts to the Company’s corporate reputation or the value and\nperception of the Company’s brand; (6) the effectiveness of the Company’s marketing and\nadvertising programs and new product development; (7) the Company’s ability to manage the\nimpact of social media; (8) the Company’s ability to protect its intellectual property; (9) food\nsafety events or health concerns involving the Company’s products; (10) our ability to deliver\naccelerated global sales growth and achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts; (11)\nthe Company’s ability to achieve its growth strategy through new restaurant development and its\nImage Activation program; (12) the Company’s ability to effectively manage the acquisition and\ndisposition of restaurants or successfully implement other strategic initiatives; (13) risks\nassociated with leasing and owning significant amounts of real estate, including environmental\nmatters; (14) risks associated with the Company’s international operations, including the ability\nto execute its international growth strategy; (15) changes in commodity and other operating\ncosts; (16) shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of the Company’s products and\nother risks associated with the Company’s independent supply chain purchasing co-op; (17) the\nimpact of increased labor costs or labor shortages; (18) the continued succession and retention\nof key personnel and the effectiveness of the Company’s leadership and organizational structure;\n(19) risks associated with the Company’s digital commerce strategy, platforms and technologies,\nincluding its ability to adapt to changes in industry trends and consumer preferences; (20) the\nCompany’s dependence on computer systems and information technology, including risks\nassociated with the failure or interruption of its systems or technology or the occurrence of cyber\nincidents or deficiencies; (21) risks associated with the Company’s securitized financing facility\nand other debt agreements, including compliance with operational and financial covenants,\nrestrictions on its ability to raise additional capital, the impact of its overall debt levels and the\nCompany’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations and operate\nits business; (22) risks associated with the Company’s capital allocation policy, including the\namount and timing of equity and debt repurchases and dividend payments; (23) risks associated\nwith complaints and litigation, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and an\nincreased focus on environmental, social and governance issues; (24) risks associated with the\navailability and cost of insurance, changes in accounting standards, the recognition of impairment\nor other charges, changes in tax rates or tax laws and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates; (25) conditions beyond the Company’s control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural\ndisasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events;\nand (26) other risks and uncertainties cited in the Company’s releases, public statements and/or\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those identified in the “Risk\nFactors” sections of the Company’s Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\nIn addition to the factors described above, there are risks associated with the Company’s\npredominantly franchised business model that could impact its results, performance and\nachievements. Such risks include the Company’s ability to identify, attract and retain experienced\nand qualified franchisees, the Company’s ability to effectively manage the transfer of restaurants\nbetween and among franchisees, the business and financial health of franchisees, the ability of\nfranchisees to meet their royalty, advertising, development, reimaging and other commitments,\nparticipation by franchisees in brand strategies and the fact that franchisees are independent\nthird parties that own, operate and are responsible for overseeing the operations of their\nrestaurants. The Company’s predominantly franchised business model may also impact the\nability of the Wendy’s system to effectively respond and adapt to market changes.\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person\nacting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements\ncontained or referred to above. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and factors\nthat the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the\nCompany to predict these events or how they may affect the Company.\nThe Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of\nthis release as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by\nfederal securities laws, although the Company may do so from time to time. The Company does\nnot endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nThere can be no assurance that any additional regular quarterly cash dividends will be declared\nor paid after the date hereof, or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. Future dividend\npayments, if any, are subject to applicable law, will be made at the discretion of the Board of\nDirectors and will be based on factors such as the Company’s earnings, financial condition and\ncash requirements and other factors.\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company prepares its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In addition to the GAAP financial measures\npresented on this website (including any materials and other information made available on this\nwebsite), the Company may also present certain non-GAAP financial measures on this website\n(including any materials and other information made available on this website), including\nadjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and systemwide\nsales. Adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share exclude certain\nexpenses and benefits as detailed on this website (including any materials and other information\nmade available on this website).\nThe Company uses adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and\nsystemwide sales as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance\nmeasures for benchmarking against the Company’s peers and competitors. Adjusted EBITDA and\nsystemwide sales are also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes\nof executive compensation. The Company believes its presentation of adjusted revenue, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and systemwide sales provides a meaningful perspective of\nthe underlying operating performance of our current business and enables investors to better\nunderstand and evaluate our historical and prospective operating performance. The Company\nbelieves these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating\nperformance because they eliminate items that vary from period to period without correlation to\nour core operating performance and highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature and/or size of the\nitems being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are\nnot indicative of our future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts\nand other interested parties use adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share\nand systemwide sales in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a\ncomparative assessment of the Company’s operating performance in addition to the Company’s\nperformance based on GAAP results.\nThis website (including any materials and other information made available on this website) also\nincludes disclosure regarding the Company’s free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is used by the Company as an internal measure of liquidity. Free cash flow\nis also used by the Company in establishing performance goals for purposes of executive\ncompensation. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows from operations minus (i)\ncapital expenditures and (ii) the net change in the restricted operating assets and liabilities of the\nadvertising funds and any excess/deficit of advertising funds revenue over advertising funds\nexpense included in net income, as reported under GAAP. The impact of our advertising funds is\nexcluded because the funds are used solely for advertising and are not available for the\nCompany’s working capital needs. The Company may also make additional adjustments for\ncertain non-recurring or unusual items to the extent identified in the reconciliation tables located\nelsewhere on this website. The Company believes free cash flow is an important liquidity measure\nfor investors and other interested persons because it communicates how much cash flow is\navailable for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing shares, paying dividends,\nrepaying or refinancing debt, financing possible acquisitions or investments or other uses of cash.\nAdjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and systemwide\nsales are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures does not replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results in\naccordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not calculate adjusted revenue, adjusted\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and systemwide sales (and similarly titled\nfinancial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be\nconsistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures presented on this website (including any materials and other information made\navailable on this website) should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the\nCompany’s performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the\nreconciliation tables located elsewhere on this website for additional information regarding\ncertain of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nDisclosure Regarding Key Business Measures\nThe Company tracks its results of operations and manages its business using certain key business\nmeasures, including same-restaurant sales, systemwide sales and Company-operated restaurant\nmargin, which are measures commonly used in the quick-service restaurant industry that are\nimportant to understanding Company performance.\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales each include sales by both Company-operated and\nfranchise restaurants. The Company reports same-restaurant sales for new restaurants after they\nhave been open for 15 continuous months and for reimaged restaurants as soon as they reopen.\nRestaurants temporarily closed for more than one fiscal week are excluded from same-restaurant\nsales.\nFranchise restaurant sales are reported by our franchisees and represent their revenues from\nsales at franchised Wendy’s restaurants. Sales by franchise restaurants are not recorded as\nCompany revenues and are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nHowever, the Company’s royalty revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by\nWendy’s franchisees and, as a result, sales by franchisees have a direct effect on the Company’s\nroyalty revenues and profitability.\nSame-restaurant sales and systemwide sales exclude sales from Argentina due to the highly\ninflationary economy of that country.\nThe Company calculates same-restaurant sales and systemwide sales growth on a constant\ncurrency basis. Constant currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and\nare derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The Company\nbelieves excluding the impact of foreign currency translation provides better year over year\ncomparability.\nU.S. Company-operated restaurant margin is defined as sales from U.S. Company-operated\nrestaurants less cost of sales divided by sales from U.S. Company-operated restaurants. Cost of\nsales includes food and paper, restaurant labor and occupancy, advertising and other operating\ncosts. Cost of sales excludes certain costs that support restaurant operations that are not\nallocated to individual restaurants, which are included in “General and administrative.” Cost of\nsales also excludes depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of long-lived assets.\nTherefore, as restaurant margin as presented excludes certain costs as described above, its\nusefulness may be limited and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other\ncompanies in our industry."
