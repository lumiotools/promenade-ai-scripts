(NASDAQ: ULTA) will host its 2024 Investor Day today, where the management team will outline Ulta Beauty’s strategic priorities to drive profitable growth and announce new long-term financial targets. \n\n“Ulta Beauty is a leader in a growing category with a proven model and substantial financial strength to invest and power our long-term growth,” said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. “More than 30 years ago, Ulta Beauty was the original disruptor in beauty bringing All Things Beauty. All In One Place®. While beauty has continued to expand and evolve, we remain true to our core purpose - we champion beauty for everyone, helping every guest discover their own possibilities through the power of beauty. The strategic priorities announced today are designed to amplify our differentiated model and drive relevant innovation to meet evolving guest needs, positioning Ulta Beauty as the destination for beauty enthusiasts for a lifetime. This plan will enable us to drive strong growth and capture greater market share in beauty and wellness. We have consistently delivered exceptional results over time, and we are well positioned to build on this record of profitable growth and shareholder value creation. We remain confident in and excited about the future of Ulta Beauty.” \n\n**Strategic Framework**\n\nUlta Beauty intends to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness through four foundational focus areas: \n\n  * Assortment: Curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts; \n  * Experience: Fostering authentic, empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage guests at every touchpoint; \n  * Access: Engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences; and \n  * Loyalty: Building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. \n\n\n\nActioning against these focus areas, Ulta Beauty plans to: \n\n  * Accelerate new store openings, targeting 1,800+ stores over the long-term; \n  * Drive loyalty program growth to 50 million members by 2028 by reaching new segments of beauty enthusiasts; \n  * Establish a leadership position in wellness with an expanded assortment and elevated experience; \n  * Deepen guest engagement through community building and advanced personalization; \n  * Drive product newness through a differentiated portfolio of exclusive, emerging and established brands, including Ulta Beauty Collection; \n  * Enhance the immersive in-store experience by investing in key differentiators including its best-in-class store associates and stylists, distinct service offerings, and signature events; \n  * Elevate digital engagement by fueling discovery through continued innovation and streamlining the shopping experience; and \n  * Heighten omnichannel satisfaction, meeting every guest where they are with a robust suite of offerings and increased speed to guest. \n\n\n\n**New Share Repurchase Authorization**\n\nUlta Beauty has long returned excess capital to shareholders through an active share repurchase program. Since launching its stock repurchase program in 2014, Ulta Beauty has returned more than $6 billion to shareholders, while continuing to make strategic growth investments. \n\nOn October 15, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3.0 billion, which replaces the prior authorization implemented in March 2024. Under the new program, as under the previous program, the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The new program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board at any time. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company’s previously announced expectations for fiscal 2024 have not changed. The Company plans to deliver: \n\nNet sales  |  $11.0 billion to $11.2 billion   \n---|---  \nComparable sales  |  -2% to 0%   \nNew stores, net  |  60-65   \nRemodel and relocation projects  |  40-45   \nOperating margin  |  12.7% to 13.0%   \nDiluted earnings per share  |  $22.60 to $23.50   \nShare repurchases  |  approximately $1 billion   \nInterest income  |  approximately $13 million   \nEffective tax rate  |  approximately 24%   \nCapital expenditures  |  $400 million to $450 million   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  $265 million to $270 million   \n  \n**Long-Term Financial Targets**\n\n“Ulta Beauty is a market leader in a robust, healthy consumer category, and we have delivered strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder value over time,” said Paula Oyibo, chief financial officer. “While we expect 2024 and 2025 will be transitional years as we manage through near-term category dynamics, over the long-term, we see additional opportunity to expand our leadership position, delivering both profitable growth and compelling shareholder value.” \n\nUlta Beauty’s new long-term financial targets for 2026 and beyond are: \n\n  * 4% to 6% net sales growth; \n  * Mid‐single‐digit operating profit growth, while targeting operating margins around 12% of net sales; and \n  * Low double‐digit diluted EPS growth. \n\n\n\nUlta Beauty’s disciplined capital allocation priorities will continue to emphasize: \n\n  * Efficiently funding ongoing operations; \n  * Reinvesting in the business to drive growth, with capital expenditures remaining between 4% and 5% of net sales; and \n  * Returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. \n\n\n\n**Webcast Information**\n\nToday’s investor meeting will be webcast live from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Central Time at <https://www.ulta.com/investor>.

(NASDAQ: ULTA) today announced financial results for the thirteen-week period (“second quarter”) and twenty-six-week period (“first six months”) ended August 3, 2024 compared to the same periods ended July 29, 2023. \n\n**13 Weeks Ended** |  **26 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**August 3,** |  **July 29,** |  **August 3,** |  **July 29,**  \n**(Dollars in millions, except per share data)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet sales  |  $  |  2,552.1  |  $  |  2,529.8  |  $  |  5,277.9  |  $  |  5,164.1   \nComparable sales (1)  |  (1.2%)  |  8.0%  |  0.2%  |  8.7%   \nGross profit (as a percentage of net sales)  |  38.3%  |  39.3%  |  38.8%  |  39.7%   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  $  |  644.8  |  $  |  600.7  |  $  |  1,310.7  |  $  |  1,212.8   \nOperating income (as a percentage of net sales)  |  12.9%  |  15.5%  |  13.8%  |  16.1%   \nDiluted earnings per share  |  $  |  5.30  |  $  |  6.02  |  $  |  11.78  |  $  |  12.90   \nNew store openings, net  |  16  |  3  |  26  |  7   \n_____________  \n(1) Comparable sales are calculated based on the comparable 13 and 26 calendar weeks in the current and prior year.   \n  \n“While we are encouraged by many positive indicators across our business, our second quarter performance did not meet our expectations, driven primarily by a decline in comparable store sales. We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store performance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,” said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. “We are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic and continuing to exercise financial discipline. In light of our first half trends and a more cautious outlook, we have updated our full year expectations. I remain confident in the power of our differentiated model, the strength of our financial foundation, and our ability to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term.” \n\n**Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023**\n\n  * Net sales increased 0.9% to $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion, primarily due to new store contribution and growth in other revenue. \n  * Comparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) decreased 1.2% compared to an increase of 8.0%, driven by a 1.8% decrease in transactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket. \n  * Gross profit was $978.2 million compared to $993.6 million. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 38.3% compared to 39.3%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleverage of store fixed costs, partially offset by growth in other revenue and lower inventory shrink. \n  * Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $644.8 million compared to $600.7 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 25.3% compared to 23.7%, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments, store expenses, and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. \n  * Operating income was $329.2 million, or 12.9% of net sales, compared to $391.6 million, or 15.5% of net sales. \n  * The tax rate was 24.3% compared to 24.2%. \n  * Net income was $252.6 million compared to $300.1 million. \n  * Diluted earnings per share was $5.30 compared to $6.02. \n\n\n\n**First Six Months of Fiscal 2024 Compared to First Six Months of Fiscal 2023**\n\n  * Net sales increased 2.2% to $5.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion, primarily due to new store contribution and growth in other revenue. \n  * Comparable sales increased 0.2% compared to an increase of 8.7%, driven by a 0.4% increase in average ticket and a 0.2% decrease in transactions. \n  * Gross profit was flat at $2.0 billion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 38.8% compared to 39.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs, partially offset by growth in other revenue. \n  * SG&A expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 24.8% compared to 23.5%, primarily due to deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments, store payroll and benefits, store expenses, and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. \n  * Operating income was $730.1 million, or 13.8% of net sales, compared to $833.7 million, or 16.1% of net sales. \n  * The tax rate was 23.7% compared to 23.5%. \n  * Net income was $565.7 million compared to $647.2 million. \n  * Diluted earnings per share was $11.78, including a $0.10 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $12.90, including a $0.14 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $414.0 million. \n\nMerchandise inventories, net at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 10.1% to $2.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to inventory to support new brand launches, the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer, SC, and the addition of 49 net new stores since July 29, 2023. \n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased 549,852 shares of its common stock at a cost of $212.3 million.

Statements\n(In thousands, except per share and store count data) (Unaudited)\n1. Business and basis of presentation\nUlta Beauty, Inc. was founded in 1990 to operate specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and\nrelated accessories and services. Nearly every store features a full-service salon. As used in these notes and throughout this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ulta Beauty,” or the “Company” refer to Ulta Beauty, Inc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries.\nAs of August 3, 2024, the Company operated 1,411 stores across 50 states, as shown in the table below.\nNumber of Number of\nLocation stores Location stores\nAlabama 27 Montana 6\nAlaska 3 Nebraska 5\nArizona 37 Nevada 16\nArkansas 11 New Hampshire 8\nCalifornia 173 New Jersey 46\nColorado 27 New Mexico 7\nConnecticut 19 New York 56\nDelaware 4 North Carolina 46\nFlorida 100 North Dakota 4\nGeorgia 44 Ohio 47\nHawaii 4 Oklahoma 22\nIdaho 10 Oregon 19\nIllinois 55 Pennsylvania 45\nIndiana 26 Rhode Island 5\nIowa 11 South Carolina 26\nKansas 14 South Dakota 3\nKentucky 16 Tennessee 32\nLouisiana 18 Texas 133\nMaine 3 Utah 15\nMaryland 29 Vermont 1\nMassachusetts 27 Virginia 35\nMichigan 49 Washington 37\nMinnesota 20 West Virginia 7\nMississippi 12 Wisconsin 21\nMissouri 26 Wyoming 4\nTotal 1,411\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission’s Article 10, Regulation S-X. These financial statements were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the\naccounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions, and unrealized profit were\neliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to fairly state the financial position and results of operations and cash flows\nfor the interim periods presented.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with significant portions of net sales and net income being realized during the\nfourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. The results for the 13 and 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending February 1, 2025, or for any other future interim period or for\nany future year.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. All amounts\nare stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, “Summary of significant accounting policies,” to the\nconsolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. Presented below and in the\nfollowing notes is supplemental information that should be read in conjunction with “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the\nAnnual Report.\nFiscal quarter\nThe Company’s quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The\nsecond quarter in fiscal 2024 and 2023 ended on August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived\ntangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management\nestimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic\nenvironment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure. The guidance updates reportable segment disclosure\nrequirements, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment\nperformance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on related disclosures.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The guidance\nincludes amendments requiring enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate\nreconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024 and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact of adopting this ASU on related disclosures.\n9\nTable of Contents\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Climate-Related Disclosures\nIn March 2024, the SEC adopted rules intended to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures in registration statements and annual\nreports. The new rules will require disclosure of material climate-related risks, including disclosure of Board of Directors' oversight and\nrisk management activities, the material impacts of these risks to us and the quantification of material impacts to us as a result of severe\nweather events and other natural conditions. The rules also require disclosure of material greenhouse gas emissions and any material\nclimate-related targets and goals. The new rules will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2025, except for the\ngreenhouse gas emissions disclosures which will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2026, however the new\nrules have been stayed by the federal courts and, as a result, the SEC has indefinitely delayed their effectiveness. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of these new rules.\n3. Revenue\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue. Other revenue includes the\nprivate label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue\nrelated to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nDisaggregated revenue\nThe following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales by primary category:\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(Percentage of net sales) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCosmetics 39% 40% 40% 42%\nSkincare 24% 23% 24% 22%\nHaircare 20% 22% 19% 21%\nFragrance 11% 9% 11% 9%\nServices 4% 4% 4% 4%\nOther 2% 2% 2% 2%\n100% 100% 100% 100%\nCertain sales departments were reclassified between categories in the prior year to conform to current year presentation, including moving\nthe bath category from Fragrance to Skincare.\nDeferred revenue\nDeferred revenue primarily represents contract liabilities for the obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a guest for which the\nCompany has received consideration, such as unredeemed Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty points and unredeemed Ulta Beauty gift cards. In\naddition, breakage on gift cards is recognized proportionately as redemption occurs.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes included in deferred revenue during the 13 and 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and\nJuly 29, 2023:\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 391,446 $ 350,123 $ 428,788 $ 388,583\nAdditions to contract liabilities (1) 120,189 114,374 253,584 237,770\nDeductions to contract liabilities (2) (123,818) (118,430) (294,555) (280,286)\nEnding balance $ 387,817 $ 346,067 $ 387,817 $ 346,067\n(1) Loyalty points and gift cards issued in the current period but not redeemed or expired.\n(2) Revenue recognized in the current period related to the beginning liability.\nOther amounts included in deferred revenue were $7,170 and $8,186 at August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n4.

No additional goodwill was recognized during the 13 and 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The recoverability of\ngoodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate\nthat impairment may exist.\nOther definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The recoverability of intangible assets is reviewed whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\n5. Leases\nThe Company leases retail stores, distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, market fulfillment centers, corporate offices, and certain\nequipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2036. All leases are classified as operating leases\nand generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and, when determined applicable, include renewal options under substantially the same\nterms and conditions as the original leases. Leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLease cost\nThe majority of operating lease cost relates to retail stores, distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, and market fulfillment centers and\nis classified within cost of sales. Operating lease cost for corporate offices is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOperating lease cost from the control date through store opening date is classified within pre-opening expenses.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating lease costs:\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 88,080 $ 83,121 $ 176,235 $ 168,249\n11\nTable of Contents\nOther information\nThe following table presents supplemental disclosures of cash flow information related to operating leases:\n26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities (1) $ 203,766 $ 196,638\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities (non-cash) 188,686 140,750\n(1) Excludes $19,882 and $17,450 related to cash received for tenant incentives for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023,\nrespectively.\n6. Commitments and contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of the business including both class action and\nsingle plaintiff litigation.

Debt\nOn March 13, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended,\nthe Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder;\nWells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders\nparty thereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 13, 2029, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $800,000 or a\npercentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50,000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the\nCompany to increase the revolving facility by an additional $200,000, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan\nAgreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when\navailability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral\nfor outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Company’s election, at either a base\nrate plus a margin of 0.5% to 1.0% or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.0%, and a credit spread\nadjustment of 0.10%, with such margins based on the Company’s borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.25% to 0.375% per\nannum.\nAs of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nAs of August 3, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\n8. Fair value measurements\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated fair values due to\nthe short maturities of these instruments.\nFair value is measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, which are described as follows:\n● Level 1 – observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n● Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration\nwith observable market data.\n12\nTable of Contents\n● Level 3 – unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own\nassumptions.\nAs of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, there were liabilities related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan\nincluded in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of $48,720, $42,653, and $42,529, respectively. The liabilities are\ncategorized as Level 2 as they are based on third-party reported values, which are based primarily on quoted market prices of underlying\nassets of the funds within the plan.\n9. Stock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The estimated grant date fair value of\nstock options was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the periods\nindicated:\n26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29,\n2024 2023\nVolatility rate 33.0% 45.0%\nAverage risk-free interest rate 4.4% 3.8%\nAverage expected life (in years) 3.5 3.4\nDividend yield — —\nThe expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the\nUnited States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents\nthe time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on Ulta\nBeauty stock option exercises. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of stock option activity\nand reduce the stock-based compensation expense recognized. The Company does not currently pay a regular dividend.\nThe Company granted 56 and 42 stock options during the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for stock options was $1,506 and $1,749 for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense for stock options was $3,185 and $3,219 for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023,\nrespectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of these stock options was $157.66 and $199.15 for the 26 weeks ended\nAugust 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. At August 3, 2024, there was approximately $15,252 of unrecognized stock-based\ncompensation expense related to unvested stock options.\nThere were 51 and 45 restricted stock units issued during the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for restricted stock units was $4,997 and $4,934 for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023,\nrespectively. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units was $9,385 and $9,293 for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024\nand July 29, 2023, respectively. At August 3, 2024, there was approximately $39,738 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense\nrelated to restricted stock units.\nThere were 71 and 33 performance-based restricted stock units issued during the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023,\nrespectively. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock units was $2,687 and $5,135 for the 13 weeks\nended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock units was\n$6,702 and $9,027 for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. At August 3, 2024, there was approximately\n$25,089 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units.\n13\nTable of Contents\n10.Income taxes\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which the\nCompany operates stores. Income tax expense of $81,171 for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 24.3%,\ncompared to $95,989 of tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.2% for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nIncome tax expense of $175,906 for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%, compared to $198,356 of\ntax expense representing an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted into law, which, among other things, introduced a 15% corporate\nalternative minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations and created a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases. The corporate\nalternative minimum tax is effective beginning in fiscal 2024 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements\nfor the 13 and 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The excise tax applies to share repurchases made after December 31, 2022.\n11.Net income per common share\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares of common stock used in the computation of net income per basic\nand diluted common share:\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 252,556 $ 300,102 $ 565,669 $ 647,153\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares – Basic 47,505 49,617 47,815 49,885\nDilutive effect of stock options and non-vested stock 162 232 207 272\nWeighted-average common shares – Diluted 47,667 49,849 48,022 50,157\nNet income per common share:\nBasic $ 5.32 $ 6.05 $ 11.83 $ 12.97\nDiluted $ 5.30 $ 6.02 $ 11.78 $ 12.90\nThe denominator for diluted net income per common share for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 excludes 184 and 127\nemployee stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. The denominator for diluted net income per\ncommon share for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 excludes 195 and 133 employee stock options and restricted stock\nunits, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. Outstanding performance-based restricted stock units are included in the computation\nof dilutive shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or\nwould be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the results would be\ndilutive under the treasury stock method.\n12.Share repurchase program\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the\nCompany could repurchase up to $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock.

We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select\nbeauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer\nwho is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation and self-investment, and has high\nexpectations for the shopping experience. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our\nfinancial performance.\nToday, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care\nproducts, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of approximately 25,000\nbeauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than\n1,400 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website,\nUlta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on\nproducts and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with\nwarm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels.\nThe continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to\nexecute our strategic priorities: 1) drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty; 2)\nevolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World; 3) expand and deepen our\npresence across the beauty journey, positioning Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community; 4) drive operational excellence and\noptimization; 5) protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent; and 6) expand our environmental and social impact. We believe the\nattractive and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the expanding definition of beauty and the role that omnichannel\ncapabilities play in consumers’ lives, coupled with Ulta Beauty’s competitive strengths, position us to capture additional market share in the\nindustry.\nComparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and\nwe expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic\nconditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.\nOver the long term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel\ncapabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate\nportfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with\n16\nTable of Contents\ncomparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and\nsupply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel\ncapabilities.\nCurrent Trends\nIndustry trends\nOur research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. The overall\nbeauty market expanded in 2023 and into the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024, supported by on-going consumer engagement with the beauty\ncategory. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly\nengaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\nPersistent inflationary and macroeconomic pressures are impacting consumer spending habits broadly, which we believe may have\ncontributed to lower sales trends through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024. The continuation of inflationary and macroeconomic pressures\ncould lead to a recession and further impact our ability to grow sales and maintain historical profitability levels. In addition, inflation could\ncause the interest rates on any future debt to remain at an elevated level or increase.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup\nof the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated\nreturns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we\nrecognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the\ncustomer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original\npurchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state\nsales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the\nguest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the\nprivate label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue\nrelated to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our\ncomparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-\ncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed\nfor part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the\ncurrent or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week\nof comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to\ncompare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate\ncomparable or same store sales.\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy.\nSeveral factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\n● the general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;\n● the introduction of new products or brands;\n● the location of new stores in existing store markets;\n17\nTable of Contents\n● competition;\n● our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;\n● the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and\n● the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.\nCost of sales includes:\n● the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n● distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and\ninsurance;\n● shipping and handling costs for e-commerce orders;\n● retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance,\ninsurance, and licenses;\n● salon services payroll and benefits; and\n● shrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nOur cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact\non cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other\nretailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include:\n● payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\n● advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n● occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;\n● stock-based compensation expense;\n● depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included\nin cost of sales; and\n● legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or\nother retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores\nincluding rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and\ngrand opening advertising.\nInterest income, net represents interest from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and\ncertificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs\nand facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is\nbased on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising or elevated interest rates.\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate\nstores.\nResults of operations\nOur quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Company’s\nsecond quarter in fiscal 2024 and 2023 ended on August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations have\nvaried in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that\n18\nTable of Contents\nperiod-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe following tables present the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales $ 2,552,087 $ 2,529,809 $ 5,277,935 $ 5,164,072\nCost of sales 1,573,910 1,536,197 3,229,978 3,115,603\nGross profit 978,177 993,612 2,047,957 2,048,469\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 644,821 600,692 1,310,734 1,212,821\nPre-opening expenses 4,155 1,278 7,074 1,936\nOperating income 329,201 391,642 730,149 833,712\nInterest income, net (4,526) (4,449) (11,426) (11,797)\nIncome before income taxes 333,727 396,091 741,575 845,509\nIncome tax expense 81,171 95,989 175,906 198,356\nNet income $ 252,556 $ 300,102 $ 565,669 $ 647,153\nOther operating data:\nNumber of stores end of period 1,411 1,362 1,411 1,362\nComparable sales (1.2%) 8.0% 0.2% 8.7%\n13 Weeks Ended 26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29, August 3, July 29,\n(Percentage of net sales) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of sales 61.7% 60.7% 61.2% 60.3%\nGross profit 38.3% 39.3% 38.8% 39.7%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 25.3% 23.7% 24.8% 23.5%\nPre-opening expenses 0.2% 0.1% 0.1% 0.0%\nOperating income 12.9% 15.5% 13.8% 16.1%\nInterest income, net (0.2%) (0.2%) (0.2%) (0.2%)\nIncome before income taxes 13.1% 15.7% 14.1% 16.4%\nIncome tax expense 3.2% 3.8% 3.3% 3.8%\nNet income 9.9% 11.9% 10.7% 12.5%\n19\nTable of Contents\nComparison of 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 to 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $22.3 million, or 0.9%, to $2.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $2.5 billion for the 13 weeks\nended July 29, 2023. The net sales increase was primarily due to new store contribution and a $5.7 million increase in other revenue. The\ncomparable sales decrease of 1.2% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 was driven by a 1.8% decrease in transactions and a 0.6%\nincrease in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit decreased $15.4 million, or 1.6%, to $978.2 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to $993.6 million for\nthe 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 38.3% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024,\ncompared to 39.3% for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower merchandise\nmargins and deleverage of store fixed costs, partially offset by growth in other revenue and lower inventory shrink.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $44.1 million or 7.3%, to $644.8 million for the 13 weeks ended\nAugust 3, 2024, compared to $600.7 million for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased\nto 25.3% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to 23.7% for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023, primarily due to deleverage of\nstore payroll and benefits, corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments, store expenses, and marketing expenses, partially\noffset by lower incentive compensation.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $4.2 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $1.3 million for the 13 weeks ended\nJuly 29, 2023.\nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net was $4.5 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $4.4 million for the 13 weeks ended\nJuly 29, 2023. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $81.2 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 24.3%, compared to $96.0\nmillion of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.2% for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nNet income\nNet income was $252.6 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to $300.1 million for the 13 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nThe decrease in net income is primarily due to the $44.1 million increase in SG&A expenses, the $15.4 million decrease in gross profit, and\nthe $2.9 million increase in pre-opening expenses, partially offset by the $14.8 million decrease in income taxes.\nComparison of 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 to 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $113.9 million, or 2.2%, to $5.3 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to $5.2 billion for the 26\nweeks ended July 29, 2023. The net sales increase was primarily due to new store contribution and a $14.8 million increase in other\nrevenue. The comparable sales increase of 0.2% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 was driven by a 0.4% increase in average ticket\nand a 0.2% decrease in transactions.\n20\nTable of Contents\nGross profit\nGross profit was $2.0 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $2.0 billion for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023. Gross\nprofit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 38.8% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to 39.7% for the 26 weeks ended\nJuly 29, 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower merchandise margin and deleverage of store fixed costs,\npartially offset by growth in other revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $97.9 million, or 8.1%, to $1.3 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to $1.2 billion for the\n26 weeks ended July 29, 2023. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 24.8% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024\ncompared to 23.5% for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023, primarily due to deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic\ninvestments, store payroll and benefits, store expenses, and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $7.1 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $1.9 million for the 26 weeks ended\nJuly 29, 2023.\nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net was $11.4 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $11.8 million for the 26 weeks ended\nJuly 29, 2023. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $175.9 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%, compared to $198.4\nmillion of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 23.5% for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nNet income\nNet income was $565.7 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to $647.2 million for the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nThe decrease in net income is primarily due to the $97.9 million increase in SG&A expenses and the $5.1 million increase in pre-opening\nexpenses, partially offset by the $22.5 million decrease in income taxes.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. The\nmost significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories, cash and cash equivalents, and receivables, reduced by\naccounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued liabilities. As of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, we had cash and\ncash equivalents of $414.0 million, $766.6 million, and $388.6 million, respectively.\nOur primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories\nrelated to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our\ninformation technology systems.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease\nexpenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures,\ninvestments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our\ninventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season.\n21\nTable of Contents\nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.\nWe generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. We believe our primary sources of\nliquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term.\nCash flows\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key\nstrengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows:\n26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 358,879 $ 428,808\nNet cash used in investing activities (191,392) (206,435)\nNet cash used in financing activities (520,119) (571,623)\nOperating activities\nOperating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease\nexpense, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the\neffect of working capital changes.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023\nwas mainly due to the timing of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and prepaid expenses and other current assets,\nthe decrease in net income, and a larger increase in merchandise inventories in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a\ndecrease in net other assets and liabilities.\nMerchandise inventories, net were $2.0 billion at August 3, 2024 compared to $1.8 billion at July 29, 2023, representing an increase of\n$182.7 million or 10.1%. The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:\n● $72 million increase due to new brand launches;\n● $56 million increase primarily due to the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer, SC; and\n● $55 million increase due to the addition of 49 net new stores opened since July 29, 2023.\nInvesting activities\nWe have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term\ninvestments, and investments in information technology systems. Investing activities for capital expenditures were $186.3 million during\nthe 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, compared to $204.7 million during the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023.\nDuring the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, we opened 29 new stores, closed three stores, relocated two stores, and remodeled nine stores,\ncompared to the 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023, when we opened eight new stores, closed one store, relocated three stores, and remodeled\nfive stores.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to lower capital expenditures for information technology systems and supply chain investments, partially offset by higher\ncapital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores and merchandising fixtures, compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems, and\nsupply chain investments we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we\nbelieve our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions.\nPurchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares\nwithheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was\nprimarily due to a decrease in the dollar amount of share repurchases.\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023. The zero outstanding\nborrowings position is due to a combination of factors including sales demand, overall performance of management initiatives including\nexpense control, and inventory and other working capital reductions. We may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in\nfuture periods for unexpected business disruptions, to support our new store program, seasonal inventory needs, or share repurchases.\nShare repurchase program\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the\nCompany could repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked\nthe previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program did not\nhave an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.\nIn March 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which\nthe Company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorization\nrevokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program\ndoes not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\n26 Weeks Ended\nAugust 3, July 29,\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023\nShares repurchased 1,137,856 1,134,737\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, including excise tax $ 501.8 $ 564.0\nCredit facility\nOn March 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan\nAgreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo\nBank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nSyndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party\nthereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 13, 2029, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $800.0 million or a\npercentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows\nthe Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $200.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions.\nThe Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not\n23\nTable of Contents\nless than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of\nthe Company’s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear\ninterest, at the Company’s election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0.5% to 1.0% or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus\na margin of 1.5% to 2.0%, and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, with such margins based on the Company’s borrowing availability, and\nthe unused line fee is 0.25% to 0.375% per annum.\nAs of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nAs of August 3, 2024, we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the\nfiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day. Any\ndecrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating\nresults for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As\nsuch, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future\nperformance.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated\nfinancial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and\nexpenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances\nand evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes\nto the critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.\nOur market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We continually monitor this risk and may develop strategies\nto manage it. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon\nvariable rates. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the\nofficers who certify our financial reports and to the members of our senior management and Board of Directors.\nBased on management’s evaluation as of August 3, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), are effective\nto ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and\nforms, and that such information is\n24\nTable of Contents\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, “Commitments and contingencies,” for information on legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition, financial results, or future performance. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThe following table sets forth repurchases of our common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2024:\nTotal number Approximate\nof shares dollar value of\npurchased as shares that may yet\npart of publicly be purchased\nTotal number Average announced under plans or\nof shares price paid plans or programs\nPeriod purchased (1) per share programs (in thousands) (2)\nMay 5, 2024 to June 1, 2024 227,498 $ 390.77 227,498 $ 1,694,463\nJune 2, 2024 to June 29, 2024 265,523 389.32 265,393 1,592,158\nJune 30, 2024 to August 3, 2024 57,299 389.99 56,961 1,570,158\n13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 550,320 389.99 549,852 1,570,158\n(1) There were 549,852 shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program during the 13 weeks ended\nAugust 3, 2024 and there were 468 shares transferred from employees in satisfaction of minimum statutory tax withholding obligations\nupon the vesting of restricted stock during the period.\n(2) In March 2024, we announced the 2024 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion\nof the Company’s common stock. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from\nthe 2022 Share Repurchase Program.

We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store\nperformance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,” said Dave Kimbell,\nchief executive officer. “We are focused on driving stronger sales and traffic and continuing\nto exercise financial discipline. In light of our first half trends and a more cautious outlook, we\nhave updated our full year expectations. I remain confident in the power of our differentiated\nmodel, the strength of our financial foundation, and our ability to deliver value for our\nshareholders over the long term.”\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023\nNet sales increased 0.9% to $2.6 billion compared to $2.5 billion, primarily due to new\nstore contribution and growth in other revenue.\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales)\ndecreased 1.2% compared to an increase of 8.0%, driven by a 1.8% decrease in\ntransactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket.\nGross profit was $978.2 million compared to $993.6 million.

Business\nOverview\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care\nproducts, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include:\nOne-of-a-kind Assortment.

We believe we offer the widest\nselection of beauty categories, from mass to prestige price points, across cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body\nproducts, professional hair products, and salon styling tools.\nStore Footprint.

Our store design, fixtures, and open\nlayout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. We also offer beauty\nservices in nearly every store, including a full-service hair salon and a BenefitTM Brow Bar. In addition to our free-standing\nlocations, through our partnership with Target Corporation we have more than 500 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shops which\nprovide guests with a highly-curated, prestige beauty assortment in a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of\ndedicated space within certain Target locations.\nLeading Digital Experiences.

Our best-in-class loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, enables members to earn points for\nevery dollar spent on products and beauty services at Ulta Beauty, through purchases on our private label and co-branded credit\ncards, and purchases at Ulta Beauty at Target. In addition to unique membership benefits, members can redeem points for\ndiscounts on any product or service at Ulta Beauty. With more than 95% of total sales coming from members, we are uniquely\npositioned with a deep understanding of our customers and their preferences, enabling us to personalize experiences,\nrecommendations, and promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform and support our brand\npartners’ growth.\nGreat Guest Experiences. We cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our\nchannels. Our knowledgeable and approachable store associates, our differentiated service offerings, and our efforts to create\nrelevant, compelling digital content are competitive advantages and enable us to build strong engagement with guests.\nWe were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels —\ndepartment stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for\nprofessional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select\nbeauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer\nwho is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high\nexpectations for the\n5\nTable of Contents\nshopping experience. We estimate beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 65% of shoppers and account for more than 80% of beauty\nproducts and services spend in the U.S.\nThe following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur strategy\nWe target beauty enthusiasts across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors. Beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection\nwith beauty, and historically, this connection has not diminished in softer economic environments. Our proprietary consumer research\nconfirms engagement with the beauty category remains strong. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery drove unprecedented\ndisruption which provided beauty enthusiasts the opportunity to develop new beauty regimens, many of which consumers are sustaining.\nDespite the disruption caused by the pandemic, beauty enthusiasts continue to demonstrate their commitment to the in-person shopping\nexperience, while also embracing the use of online shopping to supplement discovery and convenience. At the same time, rising\ncompetitive pressures and a dynamic operating environment will require strong execution and continued investment and innovation to\nfurther our leadership position.\nReflecting our understanding about how the consumer and beauty category are evolving, in 2021 we refreshed our strategic framework to\nposition Ulta Beauty for continued success. We are focused on six key strategic pillars designed to expand our market leadership and drive\nlonger-term profitable growth.\nDrive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Beauty enthusiasts enjoy the experience\nof discovering and trying new products and increasingly include beauty as part of their self-care and wellness journey. Reflecting these\ninsights, our objective is to engage and continuously delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, differentiated, inclusive assortment focused\non leading beauty and self-care trends. We are focused on four key areas: maximizing growth in core categories, including makeup,\nskincare, haircare, and fragrance; driving growth of cross-category strategic platforms, including Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®, Black-\nowned and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)-founded Brands, the Wellness Shop, and SPARKED at Ulta Beauty;\ndifferentiating our assortment through exclusive brands and products, including our private label, Ulta Beauty Collection; and increasing\nprofitability through assortment management, inventory productivity, and promotional optimization.\nEvolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World. Our guest insights and\nmember data confirm that beauty enthusiasts prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and engage with products and\nother beauty enthusiasts. At the same time, digital channels offer convenience, product reviews, and price transparency. As a result, the\nguest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels. To drive greater guest engagement across all channels, we intend\nto expand our physical footprint, continue to differentiate our service offerings, and expand our order fulfillment capabilities while further\nenhancing our digital and mobile experiences and driving competitive advantage through digital innovation. Our objective is to deliver a\ncohesive, industry-leading omnichannel experience that drives breakthrough engagement with our guests and unlocks the combined\npotential of our physical and digital channels.\nExpand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey, positioning Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community. To\nunderstand longer-term shifts in consumer values, perceptions, and behaviors, as well as of-the-moment insights, we have developed a\nrobust consumer research capability. In addition, with more than 95% of total sales coming from our 43.3 million active Ulta Beauty\nRewards loyalty program members, we have unique insights about customer preferences and behavior. Based on our proprietary insights,\nwe know beauty enthusiasts have an emotional, personal, and deep connection with beauty. Social media contributes to this connection, and\nwe expect the influence and reach of beauty will continue to grow as engagement with social platforms increases. To expand Ulta Beauty’s\nreach, relevancy, and guest engagement, we are amplifying our brand purpose; building a creator and content ecosystem to deliver\ncompelling, relevant beauty entertainment; using our member data to increase personalization, drive conversion, and support our brands;\nand recently introduced further innovation in our Ulta Beauty Rewards program. Our vision is to\n6\nTable of Contents\nexpand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey to drive consumer acquisition and increase guest engagement, loyalty, and share\nof wallet.\nDrive operational excellence and optimization. Similar to other retailers, we are experiencing persistent cost pressures from\nmacroeconomic trends, including higher wage rates and transportation and shipping costs. In addition, we anticipate ongoing headwinds\nfrom channel and category mix shifts. To mitigate the impact of these pressures and support our future growth, we have developed a\ncontinuous improvement capability to identify and activate meaningful, cross-functional process optimization opportunities; we are\nupgrading our enterprise resource planning platform to increase efficiency and support future growth; we are building a modern ecosystem\nfor future analytics and data-driven decisioning capabilities; and we are enhancing our supply chain network to increase agility, speed and\ncost-efficiency. Our vision is to deliver profitable growth and competitive advantage by optimizing our cost structure to enable scale,\ndeveloping agile operating processes that enable real-time visibility and decision-making, and building new capabilities tailored to win in a\nrapidly evolving omnichannel world.\nProtect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. We have developed and nurtured a guest and associate-centric, values-based and\nhigh-performance culture. These tenets are core to how we lead, how we engage with our guests and partners, and how we make decisions.\nWe value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking, and we respect and listen to our associates to continually improve as a\ncompany. We have an experienced leadership team and passionate associates committed to living our values while caring for our guests and\nfor each other. To support our growth and enhance the guest experience, we will continue to attract, develop and retain talent at all levels\nand in all functional areas, and we will continue to work to create an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute and\nhave an opportunity to grow.\nExpand our environmental and social impact. As a leader in the beauty industry, we have an opportunity to drive positive impact. We\nbelieve that beauty is for everyone, regardless of age, size, ability, skin tone, culture, or gender, and we strive to provide an environment\nwhere every associate feels they can realize their full potential and every guest is optimally served, regardless of differences. We empower\nand inspire guests to make informed and sustainable product choices through our unique Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® platform, and\nwe strive to protect the beauty of our natural environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by managing our stores’ energy,\nwater, and waste footprints. We are committed to making the world a better place, and we are focused on driving sustainable change in\nareas where we can make the biggest impact and committed to collaborating with others to address shared challenges.\nOur market\nWe operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. In 2023, this market represented approximately\n$181 billion in sales, according to forecasted Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. In 2023, the beauty products industry totaled\napproximately $112 billion and included cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. We\nestimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 9% share of the $112 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major\ncategories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. In 2023, the salon services industry totaled\napproximately $69 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry.\nWe have full-service hair salons in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores, as well as makeup and ear piercing\nservices through our salons. In addition, we offer skin services in approximately 150 locations.\nCompetition\nOur major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, grocery stores, drug stores,\nmass merchandisers, and the online capabilities of national retailers and brands, as well as pure-play e-commerce companies and online\nmarketplaces. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include\nchain and independent salons.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur retail channels\nWe are committed to meeting guests where and how they want to shop and strive to offer guests a compelling, personalized shopping\nexperience through our stores, digital platforms, and partnerships.\nStores\nOur member data suggests our guests prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and interact with products and other\nbeauty enthusiasts. In our fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (fiscal 2023), 76% of our loyalty members transacted with us solely in one of\nour stores. Our retail stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power strip centers. Our typical store is\napproximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our retail store concept,\nincluding physical layout, displays, lighting, and quality of finishes, has changed over time to reflect the evolution of guest preferences and\nour merchandising and operating strategies.\nWe offer a full range of beauty services in our stores, focusing on hair, makeup, brow, and skin services. Our current Ulta Beauty store\nprototype includes an open and modern salon area, with most of our stores offering brow services on the salon floor. In addition, stores\noffering skin services include a skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area on the sales floor. The salon features a concierge desk,\napproximately five to ten stations, and a shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ highly skilled, licensed professional stylists\nand estheticians who offer services as well as educational experiences, including consultations, styling lessons, makeup applications,\nskincare services, and at-home care recommendations.\nIn addition to opening new stores, we also remodeled and relocated certain stores, as shown in the following table:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n2024 2023 2022\nTotal stores beginning of period 1,355 1,308 1,264\nStores opened 33 47 48\nStores closed (3) – (4)\nTotal stores end of period 1,385 1,355 1,308\nTotal square footage 14,515,593 14,200,403 13,770,438\nAverage square footage per store 10,481 10,480 10,528\nStores remodeled 18 20 9\nStores relocated 7 12 7\nOur real estate vision is to make Ulta Beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets and is a key driver\nof how we plan to expand our market share over time. We believe that over the long term, we have the potential to grow our store footprint\nto between 1,500 to 1,700 freestanding Ulta Beauty stores in the United States.\nWe leverage a variety of insights to identify the best new store locations and optimize our current store locations, including beauty market\nshare information and insights from our loyalty members. This insight-led, analytical approach to site selection has resulted in a high\nperforming real estate portfolio. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $2.0 million, which\nincludes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment\nrequired to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic\nlocation.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to enhance and evolve our in-store experience to best engage our guests, we are introducing a new layout in\nour new and remodeled stores. While our traditional layout is organized by price point, with prestige makeup and skincare on one side of\nthe store and mass makeup and skincare on the other, our new layout brings together like categories with intuitive adjacencies to magnify\nour differentiated assortment. In the new layout, categories\n8\nTable of Contents\nflow from prestige to mass with delineated fixturing showcasing each segment. In addition, this new layout features elevated gondolas to\nshowcase key, iconic, and service brands and new Beauty Bars that offer our brow and makeup services, support in-store events, and\nhighlight beauty-in-action. We believe this new layout better reflects how our guests shop and will simplify exploration and shopping.\nDigital platform\nIn addition to store expansion, we continue to expand our digital capabilities as more of our guests choose to engage with us across physical\nand digital platforms. In fiscal 2023, 18% of our loyalty members shopped both in Ulta Beauty stores and through our digital platforms.\nOur e-commerce platform has two key roles: generating direct channel sales and profits by communicating with our guests in an interactive,\nenjoyable way that reinforces the Ulta Beauty brand; and driving traffic to our stores, website, and native applications. As part of our digital\nstore transformation, during fiscal 2023 we substantially completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and\nmigrated to a new modernized platform to enable a more seamless guest experience. Our omnichannel guests are extremely valuable,\nhistorically spending nearly three times as much as retail-only guests. We continue to develop and add new website and mobile features and\nfunctionality, marketing programs, new products and brands, and omnichannel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a\nleading online beauty resource by providing our guests with a unique, rich online experience, with information on key trends and products,\neditorial content, expanded assortments, interactive experiences, including virtual try-on capabilities, and social media content.\nWe continue to improve our order fulfillment capabilities with increased speed of delivery through existing distribution centers, fast\nfulfillment centers (e-commerce only), market fulfillment centers, and select retail stores, through more efficient processes designed for e-\ncommerce order fulfillment. In addition to ship to home order fulfillment, we offer guests “Buy Online, Pick-up in Store,” “Curbside\nPickup,” and “Store 2 Door,” which provides the ability for customers to order in-store and have products delivered to their homes. In\naddition, we offer same-day delivery for e-commerce orders in virtually all markets.\nPartnerships\nTo expand loyalty member engagement and introduce new guests to Ulta Beauty, we have formed a partnership with Target Corporation to\ncreate Ulta Beauty at Target, a “shop-in-shop” concept that offers a curated assortment of more than 60 established and emerging prestige\nbrands across a variety of categories. Co-designed by Ulta Beauty and Target, the Ulta Beauty at Target shop is intended to reflect the Ulta\nBeauty experience with a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space separate but adjacent to Target’s core\nbeauty department. The shop is staffed by Target team members who are trained by Ulta Beauty to provide recommendations and answer\nproduct questions. Members in our loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, can earn points (but not redeem) for purchases made in the Ulta\nBeauty at Target shop. Loyalty points can only be redeemed in Ulta Beauty stores, on Ulta.com or through our mobile applications. As of\nFebruary 3, 2024, Ulta Beauty at Target was available in over 500 Target locations and on target.com. Over time, we expect Ulta Beauty at\nTarget to be in up to 800 Target locations, in addition to our freestanding Ulta Beauty stores.\nMerchandising\nStrategy\nWe offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label\nbeauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. Across our stores, Ulta.com and\nour mobile applications, we offer approximately 25,000 products from approximately 600 well-established and emerging beauty brands\nacross all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. Our merchandising team\ncontinually monitors beauty and fashion trends, sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty’s product assortment fresh and\nrelevant and to ensure that our assortment reflects the diversity of our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from\nmoderately-priced brands to higher-end luxury brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCertain beauty enthusiasts are growing more interested in choosing products that support their own personal well-being and the well-being\nof workers, animals, communities, and the environment, and they are increasingly supporting brands whose products and actions align with\ntheir own values. Reflecting the growing importance of these trends, in fiscal 2020 we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® in all\nstores, on Ulta.com, and on our mobile applications. This holistic initiative provides transparency for guests to help them choose brands and\nproducts that reflect their personal values and individual needs. Through this initiative, we certify brands and products across four key\npillars, Clean Ingredients, Cruelty Free, Vegan, and Sustainable Packaging, and recognize brands for their positive impact on our\ncommunity. Displayed in stores on an endcap constructed of recycled and recyclable materials, the program launched in 2020 with 187\nbrands. As of February 3, 2024, more than 300 brands participated in the program, with more than half certified in more than one pillar. As\npart of the launch, we published our “Made Without List,” an evolving ingredient standard for clean beauty products, and established the\nConscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development, and packaging\nsustainability. With the help of our Advisory Council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® will continue to evolve and\ngrow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change.\nIn the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have increased their focus on self-care. Based on internal proprietary research,\napproximately 65% of consumers see the beauty category as being significantly connected to wellness. In response to this trend, we created\nThe Wellness Shop, dedicated space in our store and online that offers a curated assortment of products to support guests wellness journey\nacross six pillars: everyday care, supplements and ingestibles, relax and renew, down there care, spa at home, and intimate wellness.\nWe have a long tradition of being a diversity-forward company. We aspire to be beauty at its most inclusive and have made several\nimportant commitments across our marketing, assortment, and training efforts to ensure guests, associates, partners, and communities feel\nconnected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty and are able to discover beauty on their own terms. During fiscal 2023, we increased the number\nof Black-owned and Black-founded brands in our assortment to 50 brands, up 92% since making our commitment to dedicate 15% of our\nbrand assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands over time.\nWe believe our private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection, is a strategically important opportunity for growth and profit contribution. Our\nobjective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of Ulta Beauty as a\ncontemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production to\ndeliver differentiated packaging and formulas that enhance our brand image. The Ulta Beauty Collection has been certified in the Clean\nIngredients and Cruelty Free pillars within the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® program. We also offer products such as Tarte Double\nDuty Beauty cosmetics and IT Brushes for Ulta Beauty that are permanently exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Similarly, we offer a number of\nbrands and products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Juvia’s\nPlace, and Good Molecules. The Ulta Beauty Collection and permanent Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 3% of\nour total net sales in fiscal 2023. Both permanent and temporary exclusive products represented approximately 8% of our total net sales in\nfiscal 2023.\nCategories\nWe offer a balanced portfolio across six primary categories: (1) cosmetics; (2) skincare; (3) haircare products and styling tools; (4)\nfragrance and bath; (5) services; and (6) accessories and other, which includes other revenue sources such as the private label and co-\nbranded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and\ngift card breakage.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributed to each category for the periods presented:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(Percentage of net sales) 2024 2023 2022\nCosmetics 41% 42% 43%\nSkincare 19% 17% 17%\nHaircare products and styling tools 19% 21% 20%\nFragrance and bath 15% 14% 14%\nServices 3% 3% 3%\nAccessories and other 3% 3% 3%\n100% 100% 100%\nOrganization\nOur merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising Officer who oversees the Senior Vice President of Cosmetics and category Vice\nPresidents who in turn oversee Divisional Merchandise Managers and their teams of buyers. Our Chief Merchandising Officer also\noversees our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure consistent execution across our omnichannel platforms and\nour planogram team.\nIn stores, we present products in an open-sell environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product\nplacement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our planogram team assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep\nnew products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis, and\nadjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends. Our visual team works with our\nmerchandising team to develop strategic placement of promotional merchandise, functional and educational signage, and creative product\npresentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive centrally produced promotional merchandising planners to ensure consistent\nimplementation of our marketing programs.\nPlanning and allocation\nWe have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our\nmerchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group\nserves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales\nforecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each\nproduct category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts, and inventory levels and is used\nthroughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying\nopportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine\nreplenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To\nensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of\nclearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis.\nBrand partnerships\nWe have strong, active relationships with our brand partners. Our top ten brand partners, such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder Companies,\namong others, represented 55% and 56% of our total net sales in fiscal 2023 and our fiscal year ended January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022),\nrespectively. We believe our brand partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement, and we work\nclosely with them to market both new and existing brands.\nAll brand partners and respective subcontractors and their facilities are subject to the applicable Ulta Vendor Standards, which set forth the\nethical, legal, social, and workplace standards to meet in order to do business with Ulta Beauty. In addition to complying with Ulta Vendor\nStandards, many brand partners have committed to help advance our mission to\n11\nTable of Contents\nmaintain the beauty of our environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by offering sustainable packaging. We have made\na commitment that 50% of packaging from products sold at our stores will be recyclable, refillable, or made from recycled or bio-sourced\nmaterials by 2025.\nMarketing and advertising\nWe employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores, website, and mobile applications,\nacquire new loyalty program members, improve guest retention, increase frequency of shopping, and increase spend per member. We\ncommunicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including print advertising, digital and social media,\ntelevision and radio. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and\nservices, and special offers, as well as build our emotional connection with guests. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances\nUlta Beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, supports our charitable efforts related to the Ulta Beauty\nCharitable Foundation, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events, and new store openings.\nThe Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty program is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the\nUlta Beauty brand. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated analysis of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as\ngreater personalization of our marketing campaigns and day-to-day communications. Our data demonstrates that loyalty members spend\nmore per visit as compared to non-members. Ulta Beauty Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases at Ulta Beauty\nstores, through our digital platforms, and at Ulta Beauty at Target. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any\nproduct we sell or service we provide in Ulta Beauty stores or through our digital platforms. To enhance our loyalty program, we offer co-\nbranded and private label credit cards. The credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members, provide\nincreased consumer insights, and offer attractive economics. Furthermore, we continue to expand our gift card program through increased\ndistribution in our store and online channels and through partnerships with third parties.\nWe are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense towards digital, social media, and streaming advertising. We believe these\nchannels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as driving consideration amongst those who have not yet\nshopped with us. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, social media, display\nadvertising, and other digital marketing channels. Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us\nincrease brand awareness and consideration among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests.\nRetail media network\nWe have a deep understanding of our Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty members and their preferences. This unique understanding combined\nwith our ongoing investment in data analytics and CRM capabilities enables us to create personalized experiences and value for our guests\nand has unlocked new ways for us to support our brand partners and drive additional vendor income. In 2022 we launched our retail media\nnetwork, UB Media, to transform the way our brand partners can connect with beauty enthusiasts. UB Media offers brands a suite of media\nand advertising capabilities that aim to personalize guest engagement and drive the acquisition of new guests.\nStaffing and operations\nRetail stores\nOur current Ulta Beauty store format is typically staffed with a general manager, a services manager, and three associate managers, along\nwith approximately 28 full- and part-time associates, including approximately four to eight prestige consultants and five to ten licensed\nsalon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the General Manager. The General Manager oversees all store activities\nincluding salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring, and guest services. Members of\nstore management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various performance metrics. Each General Manager reports\nto a District Manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to a Senior Vice President\n12\nTable of Contents\nof Stores, who in turn reports to the Chief Store Operations Officer, who in turn reports to the President and Chief Operating Officer, who\nin turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for\nthe retail and salon operations, regionally based talent development managers, a field loss prevention team, service district educators and\nservice district leaders, and brand partners.\nUlta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, typically eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our\nstores have extended hours during the holiday season.\nSalon services\nA typical salon is staffed with five to ten licensed salon professionals, including six or more stylists, and select stores have an esthetician.\nOur most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our services district educators and brand partner education\nclasses create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 7,500 Ulta Beauty salon professionals.\nSupply chain\nOur vision is to build and operate a dynamic and agile end-to-end supply chain that improves operational efficiency, performance, and guest\nexperience to fuel organizational growth effectively. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution\ncenter network to support our new store and e-commerce growth. We operate four regional distribution centers that support both stores and\ne-commerce demand, and two fast fulfillment centers that support e-commerce orders only. In fiscal 2023, we opened our first market\nfulfillment center, which is smaller than our regional distribution centers, and focuses on our most productive products and supports e-\ncommerce sales and store demand, enabling us to improve service and responsiveness, especially in markets with high store and population\ndensity. In addition, approximately 400 stores fulfill e-commerce orders as part of our ship-from-store program.\nInventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, and market fulfillment centers. We replenish our\nstores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one\nor two of a particular product is required. Our distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, and market fulfillment centers use warehouse\nmanagement software systems to manage inventory to support product purchase decisions. Product is delivered to stores using a broad\nnetwork of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers.\nHuman capital management\nWe believe our associates, with their combined skills, knowledge, experiences, and commitment to serving our guests, are among our most\nimportant resources and are critical to our continued success. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our\nhearts, caring for each other in everything we do, and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity in our daily actions.\nThe following table sets forth the approximate number of associates employed as of February 3, 2024:\nFull-time 20,000\nPart-time 36,000\nTotal associates 56,000\nWe have no collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relationships with\nour associates.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nOur goal is to create an inclusive environment where associates feel they can be their authentic selves and every guest is optimally served,\nregardless of differences. A critical way we achieve this is by educating all associates on the lived\n13\nTable of Contents\nexperiences of their peers and key moments in time that have cultural or heritage significance, as well as the unconscious beliefs and biases\nthat shape our behavior today. We embed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts through a cross-functional approach, led by our Chief\nExecutive Officer, to ensure teams remain energized and motivated to lead in this critical space and integrate DEI in all that we do. We\naccomplish this through inclusive recruitment strategies, dedicating time to celebrate intersectionality and diversity, encouraging associates\nto build personal habits through everyday inclusive actions, and managing a diverse leaders program to empower, inspire, and educate high-\npotential diverse associates.\nIn addition, we aim to ensure that all in-store experiences are equitable, fair, and unbiased. We take action to support this goal by\nconducting quarterly trainings for in-store associates and providing weekly learning opportunities to focus on guest perspectives and\nreinforce key takeaways. We offer similar training across the organization to help key decision-makers and associates in their own learning\njourneys and support our Champion Diversity value and inclusion competency.\nThe following table sets forth key metrics as of February 3, 2024:\nBoard of All Other\nDirectors Leadership Associates\nWomen 55% 65% 91%\nMen 45% 35% 9%\nPeople of color 36% 26% 55%\nOversight and management\nWe strive to make sure that our associates are at the heart of every decision we make. The Chief Human Resources Officer, along with the\nentire executive team, is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction,\nacquisition, development, and engagement of talent and the design of associate compensation and benefits programs. Our human capital\nobjectives and initiatives, including the risks related to compensation policies and practices, management development and leadership\nsuccession, DEI policies and practices, and implementation and compliance monitoring of our code of business conduct, are also overseen\nby individual Board committees as described in our corporate governance guidelines.\nWe believe open and honest two-way communication is critical to maintaining strong associate engagement. We regularly conduct an\nassociate engagement survey to determine associates’ satisfaction with their roles, their leaders, and the Company as a whole, which our\nexecutive team reviews and monitors. Our leadership team also hosts roundtable sessions, as well as additional forums, including\ndepartment town halls, store and distribution center visits, and other small group gatherings, to dive deeper on specific topics.\nTraining and development\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We\nare committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement opportunities. Our associates and management\nteams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates, and outside hires to\nsupport our new stores. The majority of our promotions are internal. As we continue to promote and develop from within, we are building a\nbench of associates and leaders who understand our business well and support our values-driven culture.\nAll of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty’s\nmission, vision, and values. Through our learning management system and our digital workplace system, we provide continuing education\nto associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Additionally, our leadership development program prepares promising future leaders\nfor new levels of responsibility.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCompensation and benefits\nOur commitment to our associates and their well-being is one of our highest priorities. We have assembled a suite of benefits that affirms\nand supports all that our associates contribute every day, including:\n● Health care coverage is offered to those who work more than 30 hours a week in any position. Coverage extends to eligible\ndependents, including spouses, domestic partners, and children under the age of 26. We offer comprehensive medical plans that\nempower associates to choose the coverage that best suits them.\n● 401(k) plan with up to a 4% company match.\n● Disability and life insurance.\n● Company-paid short-term disability pay at 80% of pay.\n● Additional insurance options, including legal, pet, home, and auto.\n● Tuition reimbursement program.\n● Paid time off, including an extended illness bank.\n● Discounts on retail products and salon services.\nIn addition, we believe wellness, like beauty, is more than skin deep, so we offer mental health resources, such as counseling services and\naccess to mobile applications, financial wellness planning and guidance, and health mobile applications and educational resources for soon-\nto-be parents.\nThe Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation supports the Associate Relief Program to assist associates facing unforeseen financial hardship. The\nAssociate Relief Program provides short-term financial support to reimburse medical bills or support temporary housing.\nSustainability\nWe strive to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. Our retail stores are focused on energy reduction efforts by maintaining safe\nindoor air for all customers while products are being used in our salons, using adequate energy-efficient lighting, managing the in-store\ntemperatures, and making efficient use of water needed for our salon services. In addition, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our\ncarbon footprint by investments in renewable energy credits and working with our brand partners to identify ways to work together to\nreduce Scope 3 emissions.\nInformation technology\nWe are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and\nsystems to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. In fiscal 2021, we began a multi-\nyear strategic investment agenda to upgrade key elements of our technology infrastructure including upgrading our our enterprise resource\nplanning platform and refreshing our POS system in all stores, driving our digital store transformation, and building a modern ecosystem\nfor future analytics and data-driven decisioning capabilities. Collectively, these investments are aimed at providing a flexible and scalable\noperating environment allowing for greater business efficiency and enhancing the guest experience. We will continue to make investments\nin our information systems to facilitate growth and enhance our competitive position.

The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA\nmark, including Ulta Beauty and two related designs, Ulta.com and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (and design). We maintain our\nmarks and monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been\napplied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and other countries in Latin America,\nEurope, and Asia.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta Beauty brand, “All Things Beauty. All In One Place. ®”, “The Possibilities\nare Beautiful®”, “21 Days of Beauty®”, and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®” have significant value and are important to building brand\nrecognition.\nGovernment regulation\nWe are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. Such\nlaws, regulations, and other constraints exist at the federal, state, or local levels in the United States. The products we sell, such as\ncosmetics (including products with cannabidiol), dietary supplements, food, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, and styling\ntools, including our Ulta Beauty branded products, may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state\nregulatory agencies, and State Attorneys General (State AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing,\nadvertising, and distribution of the products. In addition, the salon services provided in our stores may be subject to state and local\nregulations.\nCosmetics, OTC drugs, medical devices, and dietary supplements have specific regulatory requirements, including but not limited to\ningredient, labeling, manufacturing, and holding requirements. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical\ndevices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the\nFDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g., blow dryers and curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements\nincluding the requirement to report certain product defects. The labeling and packaging of all of these products may also be subject to the\nrequirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and state specific requirements.\nFurther, statements we make in advertising, including statements about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing, and environmental\nclaims, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, which generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices.\nFederal, state, municipal, and local labor and employment statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, mandates, and taxation laws, to which\nmost retailers are typically subject, also impact our day-to-day operations. We are also subject to typical governmental and real estate land\nuse restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services operations are subject to state\nboard regulations and state licensing requirements.\nIn our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary governmental approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail\nsite, and we also ask them to obtain any governmental approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for\nobtaining governmental approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). As applicable, we require our landlords to deliver a\ncertificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. If required by\nthe municipality, we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are\nresponsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the\nfiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day.\nAvailable information\nOur principal website address is www.ulta.com. We make available at this address under investor relations (at https://ulta.com/investor),\nfree of charge, our proxy statement, annual report to shareholders, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current\nreports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with\nor furnished to the SEC. Information available on our website is not incorporated by reference in and is not deemed a part of this Form 10-\nK. In addition, our filings with\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe SEC may be accessed through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. All statements made in any of our securities filings, including all\nforward-looking statements or information, are made as of the date of the document in which the statement is included, and we do not\nassume or undertake any obligation to update any of those statements or documents unless we are required to do so by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future growth.\nWe could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States, as well as other risks that are not\npresently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other\ninformation contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment in our common stock.\nBusiness, Operational and Strategic Risks\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans and\nsuccessfully open and operate new stores profitably. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth\nplans, long-range strategic imperatives and/or operational excellence priorities, including continuous improvement, Project SOAR (our\nreplacement enterprise resource planning platform) and supply chain optimization, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decrease.\nWe believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:\n● recognize and define product and beauty trends;\n● anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer preferences (including relating to sustainability of product sources and\npackaging, ingredient transparency, and animal welfare) in a timely manner;\n● translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product and service offerings in our stores and salons in advance of our\ncompetitors;\n● develop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms; and\n● distribute merchandise to our stores in an efficient and effective manner and maintain appropriate in-stock levels.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer, our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to\nincrease markdowns of slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nprofitability, and cash flows.\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market fulfillment centers could disrupt our\nability to deliver merchandise to our stores and guests in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with direct-to-store arrangements from vendors or wholesalers.\nWe are a retailer carrying approximately 25,000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends, which makes\nthe success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure. Any significant interruption in the\noperation of our supply chain infrastructure, such as disruptions in our information systems, disruptions in operations due to fire, natural\ndisasters, or other catastrophic\n17\nTable of Contents\nevents, labor disagreements, inventory availability, or shipping and transportation problems, could drastically reduce our ability to receive\nand process orders and provide products and services to our stores and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, shipping and transportation costs represent a component of our cost structure\nand an increase in shipping and transportation costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures, could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur e-commerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe offer most of our beauty products for sale through our Ulta.com website and through our mobile applications. As a result, we encounter\nrisks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile\napplications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct\nadvantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create\nissues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it\nmay do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our\nmobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering\ndifferent products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to\nconsider competing distributors of beauty products. Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications\ncould also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their\nown or through competing distributors. Additionally, omnichannel retailing continues to rapidly evolve, and we must keep pace with\nchanging guest expectations and new developments by our competitors. As we continue to grow our e-commerce platform, the impact of\nattracting existing rather than new guests, conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our\nstores, and opening up our channels to increased competition from pure-play e-commerce companies could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant guest-\nfacing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreased costs or interruption in our third-party vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment, or receipt\nof some of our merchandise, which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\nWe directly source the majority of our Ulta Beauty branded product components and gifts with purchase and other promotional products\nthrough third-party vendors using foreign factories. In addition, many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to\nmanufacture some or all of their products. Any event causing a disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries,\nincluding the imposition of import restrictions, geopolitical events, unanticipated political changes, increased customs duties, and legal or\neconomic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products, could result in substantial disruptions in our supply\nchain (including inventory availability) and materially harm our operations. We have no long-term supply contracts with respect to such\nforeign-sourced items, many of which are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types\nof goods that may be imported into the United States from such countries. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally\nassociated with sourcing goods from abroad, such as political instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes, and local business\npractices. Our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise\nis produced, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas, or acts of war or terrorism, to the extent these acts\naffect the production, shipment, or receipt of merchandise. Our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors, and these\nfactors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to modify\nour current business practices and incur increased costs.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on our good relationships with brand partners to purchase prestige, mass, and salon beauty products on reasonable terms, and\nto offer certain brands or products that are permanently or temporarily exclusive to us. If these relationships were to be impaired, or if\ncertain brand partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our\ngrowth plans, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms, and we may not be able\nto respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive\nposition, business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe have no long-term supply agreements with brand partners, and therefore, our success depends on maintaining good relationships with\nour brand partners. Our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our brand partners to supply us with a\nsufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores. Some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us\nwith sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands, which have\nallowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or\nend its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from\nthe sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners, or if we fail to continue acquiring and\nstrengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of\nmerchandise on reasonable terms may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.\nDuring fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, merchandise supplied to Ulta Beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 55%\nand 56% of our net sales, respectively. There continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry. The loss of or a\nreduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors, or by any of our other brand partners, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe also offer products that are permanently exclusive to us and offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive to us for a limited\nperiod of time or are offered in advance of our competitors. If our brand partners ceased granting us permanent or temporary exclusive\nrights our net sales could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nprofitability.\nIf we are unable to protect against inventory shrink, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to effectively manage our inventory. Risk of inventory loss (also called shrink) is inherent in the retail\nbusiness. We have historically experienced inventory shrink due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes.\nWhile some level of inventory shrink is unavoidable, we continue to experience elevated levels of inventory shrink relative to historical\nlevels, which have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. To protect\nagainst rising inventory shrink, we have taken, and may continue to take, certain operational and strategic actions that could adversely\naffect our reputation, guest experience, and results of operations.\nOur comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could result in a decline in the\nprice of our common stock.\nOur comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the\nfuture. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance, including:\n● general U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment;\n● changes in our merchandising strategy or mix;\n● performance of our new and remodeled stores;\n● the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n● timing and concentration of new store openings, including additional human resource requirements and related pre-opening and\nother start-up costs;\n19\nTable of Contents\n● cannibalization of existing store sales by new store openings;\n● timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities;\n● seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions;\n● actions by our existing or new competitors; and\n● hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes, mudslides, other natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, and geopolitical events.\nAccordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and\ncomparable sales for any particular future period may decrease. In that event, the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers, fast fulfillment\ncenters, and market fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our future growth, which could prevent the successful\nimplementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe currently operate four regional distribution centers, which house the distribution operations for Ulta Beauty retail stores together with\nthe order fulfillment operations of our e-commerce platform, two fast fulfillment centers (e-commerce only), and one market fulfillment\ncenter (with a second one expected to open in fiscal 2024), which focuses on our most productive products and supports e-commerce and\nretail stores. To support our expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business, it is likely additional distribution\nfacilities will be added in the future. Our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace\nwith our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, our results of operations and financial condition could be\nadversely affected.\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing, and promotional activities. We use\nmarketing, advertising, and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile\napplications, email, and print. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nadvertising and marketing programs. Further, disruption to certain media channels could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation.\nGiven the pervasive use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based and mobile\ncommunications, negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value\nreadily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source.\nThe harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest\naccounts. As laws and regulations evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees, or third parties\nacting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel at all levels, such failure could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization. This execution requires an experienced and talented\nmanagement team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts, and abilities of key executive personnel, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n20\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, our ability to manage our retail expansion requires us to continue to train, motivate, and manage our associates. We also need\nto attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified executive, managerial, and merchandising personnel and store and distribution center\nassociates. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating, and retaining the\npersonnel required to grow and operate our business profitably. In addition, fluctuations in the cost of labor, including as a result of\ninflationary pressures on wages, may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nOur secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility, including our\nability to open stores.\nWe have an $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in March 2029. Substantially all of our assets are pledged\nas collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement. The credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive\ncovenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and repurchase our stock, and\nmerge or consolidate with another entity, and requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such\nperiods when availability under the agreement falls below a specified threshold. These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility\nand any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and, in\ncertain circumstances, may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment.\nEconomic, Market and Other External Risks\nMacroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, elevated interest rates and recessionary concerns, as well as continuing labor cost pressures,\nand transportation and shipping cost pressures, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition,\nprofitability, and cash flows. We expect the impact of inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2024, and we continue to closely monitor\nmacroeconomic conditions, including customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening\ninflation, recessionary concerns and/or cost pressures, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,\nprofitability, and/or cash flows.\nAlthough we do not have any operations outside the United States, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the\nMiddle East, have caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and exacerbated the inflation situation.\nThe health of the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. We appeal to a wide\ndemographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon\nservices. Uncertainty in the economy could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product\ncategories, including prestige beauty products and premium salon services. Factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such\ndiscretionary purchases include: general business conditions, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, levels of employment, interest\nrates, tax rates, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, and risks related to epidemics or\npandemics and geopolitical events. In the event of a prolonged period of inflation, an economic downturn or a recession, consumer\nspending habits could be adversely affected, and we could experience lower than expected net sales.\nIn addition, a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our brand partners as\nwell as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located. A\nbankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Additionally, volatility and disruption to\nthe capital and credit markets may have a\n21\nTable of Contents\nsignificant, adverse impact on global economic conditions, resulting in inflationary or recessionary pressures and declines in consumer\nconfidence and economic growth, which, in turn, may lead to declines in consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending could cause\nchanges in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers, and may signify a reset of\nconsumer spending habits, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets.\nThe markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group\nof retailers, both small and large, including regional and national department stores, specialty retailers, drug stores, mass merchandisers,\nhigh-end and discount salon chains, locally owned beauty retailers and salons, online capabilities of national retailers, pure-play e-\ncommerce companies, online marketplaces, catalog retailers, and direct response television, including television home shopping retailers\nand infomercials. We believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise, our value proposition, the quality\nof our guests’ shopping experience, and the convenience of our stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and salon services. Many\nof our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing, and other resources and\ntherefore, may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of\ntheir products, generate greater national brand recognition, or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. As a result, we may lose\nmarket share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nA reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could\nsignificantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAs a result of our real estate strategy, most of our stores are located in off-mall shopping areas known as power centers. Power centers\ntypically contain three to five big-box anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants. As a consequence of most of our\nstores being located in such shopping areas, our sales are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination\nretailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely\naffected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores, or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or\nglobal economic downturn, a public health crisis, a general downturn in the local area where our store is located, or a decline in the\ndesirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center. Such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave\nus with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We\nmay respond by increasing markdowns, initiating marketing promotions, or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory,\nwhich would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\nEpidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, or other catastrophes or crises could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, profitability, and cash flows.\nEpidemics, pandemics, or other public health crises, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides,\nas well as acts of violence or terrorism, have resulted in the temporary closure of our stores and, in the future, could also result in physical\ndamage to our properties, the temporary closing of our stores, the temporary closing of our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market\nfulfillment centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products (or a\nsubstantial increase in the cost of those products) from domestic or foreign suppliers, the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both\nto and from our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market fulfillment centers (or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries), the\ntemporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and/or the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers.\nAccordingly, if one or more epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, and/or acts of violence or terrorism were to occur in the future, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to incur increased\ncosts.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOur stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may\nresult in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the\nCompany to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which\ncould cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our\nstock price and the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of\nsuch a program. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our\ncommon stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock.\nClimate change might adversely impact our business operations and/or our supply chain.\nScientific consensus shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause\nchanges in weather patterns around the globe. Climatologists predict these changes will result in the increased frequency of extreme\nweather events and natural disasters which could disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers. These weather events could also\nlead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores. In addition, concern about climate change\nand greenhouse gases may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and/or regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of\nclimate change on the environment. Any such new requirements could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging, as\nwell as our product supply chain and distribution costs.\nThere is also increased focus, including by investors, guests, and other stakeholders, on climate change and other environmental, social,\ngovernance and sustainability matters, including single use plastic, energy, waste and worker safety. Concern about climate change might\ncause consumer preferences to change, including moving away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact\nand towards products that are more sustainably made, and we expect to incur additional costs in connection with our initiatives in this area.\nOur reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to these matters and, taken together,\nthese matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows, as well as our ability to\nmeet the needs of our customers.\nInformation Security, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nCybersecurity or information security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, result in the unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential guest, employee, Company and/or business partners’ information, damage our reputation, and expose us to\nliability, which could negatively impact our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, and store sensitive and confidential data, including our proprietary business\ninformation and that of our guests, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees, in\nour data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations.\nWe rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of\nconfidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive\ninformation, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, denial-of-service attacks,\nbreak-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar\nevents. Furthermore, we allow certain of our employees to work remotely, as certain of our third-party service providers also allow, and this\nremote working environment may increase cybersecurity related risks. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the\ninformation stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information\ncould result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations,\ndamage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our business, products, and services, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information\ntechnology systems, successfully upgrade our information technology systems, or any material disruption of our information systems\ncould negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations, particularly during the holiday season.\nWe are dependent on a variety of information systems, including management, supply chain and financial information, and various other\nprocesses and transactions, to effectively manage our business. We also are expanding and upgrading our information systems (including\nreplacing our enterprise resource planning platform through Project SOAR) to support historical and expected future growth. The failure of\nthese projects, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed, or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of our operations. Any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track, record, and analyze the\nmerchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, the\nprocessing of transactions, our ability to receive and process e-commerce orders, and/or the reporting of financial results.\nOur e-commerce operations are increasingly important to our business. The Ulta.com website and our mobile applications serve as an\neffective extension of Ulta Beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies by exposing potential new customers to the Ulta Beauty brand,\nproduct offerings, and enhanced content. As the importance of our website, mobile applications, and e-commerce operations to our business\ncontinues to grow, we are increasingly vulnerable to downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these\nrisks could reduce e-commerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to negative\nfinancial consequences, including civil or criminal penalties, and harm our brand and reputation.\nComplex local, state and national laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other\nprocessing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and\nregulations proposed and implemented frequently (such as those enacted by California and certain other states) and existing laws and\nregulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. Complying with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur\nsubstantial costs, require changes to our business practices, and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest\nexperience. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating\nto personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and\nregulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by guests and other affected individuals, fines, and/or damage to our brand and\nreputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nLitigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation, proceedings or claims, including\npossible fines and penalties, could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be\nadequate to cover actual losses.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation, including potential class action and single-plaintiff litigation and other legal or regulatory\nproceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, consumer\nclaims, security of consumer and employee personal information, contractual relations with suppliers, marketing and infringement of\ntrademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that\nwe may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could absorb significant management time and/or result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We establish\naccruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a matter\neven if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or in the\naggregate. Any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n24\nTable of Contents\nSpecifically, our technologies, promotional products purchased from third-party vendors, and/or Ulta Beauty branded products, or potential\nproducts in development may infringe rights under patents, patent applications, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of\nthird parties in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial\nexpenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a third party were to bring an intellectual property\ninfringement suit against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing, or sales of the product that is the subject of\nthe suit.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a\nlicense from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available\non acceptable terms, or at all. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our\nbusiness operations if, as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on\nacceptable terms. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which would give our competitors access to the\nsame intellectual property. The inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly.\nIf our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty Collection and\nUlta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we could\nsuffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of\nall products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and\nother promotional products. The FDA does not currently have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics, but requires safety and efficacy\nsubstantiation. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be required to take\ncostly corrective action. In addition, sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products, injunctions against future shipment of\nproducts, restitution and disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. These events could interrupt the\nmarketing and sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the\ncost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations, or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities\nor of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe, as well as our vendors, are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur\nincreased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels can affect our business. Legal requirements are\nfrequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or\ntheir effect on our operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, a\nprohibition on the operation of our stores, or a prohibition on the sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products. In particular, failure to\nadequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nprofitability, and cash flows.\n● Our large workforce makes us vulnerable to changes in labor and employment laws. In addition, changes in federal and state\nminimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs,\nwhich could hurt our profitability and affect our growth strategy.\n● Our salon operations are subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon\nprocedures. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulatory and licensing requirements could jeopardize the viability of our\nsalons.\n● We operate stores in California, which has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and\nreasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or\nreproductive toxicity. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there can be no assurance that we\nwill not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.\n25\nTable of Contents\n● Future changes in healthcare reform legislation could significantly impact our business.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, and storage of our vendors’ products and our Ulta Beauty branded\nproducts are also subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including FDA, FTC, CPSC, and various state and local\nagencies, such as State AGs and District Attorneys. If we, our vendors, or the manufacturers of our Ulta Beauty branded products fail to\ncomply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties, claims, or product recalls, which could harm our results of\noperations, our reputation and/or our ability to conduct our business.\nAdditionally, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance\ncosts or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our Ulta Beauty branded products,\nresulting in significant loss of net sales. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or local requirements when we advertise our products\n(including prices) or services, or engage in other promotional activities, in digital (including social media), television, or print may result in\nenforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products.\nOur associates or others may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with our policies and\nprocedures.\nWe are exposed to the risk of misconduct or other improper activities by our associates and third parties such as independent contractors or\nagents. Misconduct by associates, independent contractors, or agents could include inadvertent or intentional failures to comply with our\npolicies and procedures, the laws and regulations to which we are subject, and/or ethical, social, product, labor, and environmental\nstandards. Our current and former associates or independent contractors may also become subject to allegations of sexual harassment, racial\nand gender discrimination, or other similar misconduct, which, regardless of the ultimate outcome, may result in adverse publicity that\ncould significantly harm our brand, reputation, and operations. Associate misconduct could also involve improper use of information\nobtained in the course of the associate’s prior or current employment, which could result in legal or regulatory action and harm to our\nreputation.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe regard our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. Our\nprincipal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on “The Possibilities are Beautiful.®,” “Ulta Beauty,”\n“Ulta,” and other marks incorporating our name and “All Things Beauty.

As such, we rely on trademark and\ncopyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, suppliers, and others to\nprotect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other\nproprietary rights for any reason (including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property\nrights), or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be impaired, and we could lose\ncustomers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we license certain of our trademarks to some of our business partners. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our\nbusiness partners covering, among other things, use of our brand name, the value of our brand and our reputation could be impaired to the\nextent that our business partners do not operate their businesses, including their stores or websites, in a manner consistent with our\nrequirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other\nharmful acts or omissions by a business partner, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, cash flows\nand reputation.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur Ulta Beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their\ndiscontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nUnexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our Ulta Beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label\nwarnings or salon services, which may have been performed negligently, could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of\ncertain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services. Such side\neffects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future\ninsurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash\nreserves, which would reduce our capital resources. These events could cause negative publicity regarding our Company, brand, or\nproducts, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a\nsale of the Company would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium\nover the market price of our common stock, and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the\nholders of our common stock. These provisions include:\n● authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock without stockholder\napproval;\n● prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n● prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; and\n● requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or\nmore of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified exceptions. Together, these\nprovisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and\nmay discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the\noperations of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, point of sale, e-commerce, marketing, finance, accounting, and human\nresources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate together with our internally developed\nsoftware solutions across a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores, and our distribution center infrastructure.\nWe manage data security and privacy at the highest levels. The Company’s Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk\nmanagement (ERM), designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term\norganizational performance and enhance stockholder value. Management is responsible for the Company’s day-to-day risk management\nactivities and processes, and our Board’s role is to engage in informed oversight of, and provide guidance with respect to, such risk\nmanagement activities and processes. The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, and practices are fully integrated into the\nCompany’s ERM program and are based on recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the\n27\nTable of Contents\nInternational Organization for Standardization and other applicable industry standards. In general, the Company seeks to address\ncybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, proactive cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality, security,\nand availability of the information that the Company collects and stores by identifying, preventing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats and\neffectively responding to cybersecurity incidents if they occur.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs one of the critical elements of the Company’s overall ERM approach, the Company’s cybersecurity program is focused on the following\nkey areas:\nCollaborative Approach.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels –\ndepartment stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for\nprofessional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select\nbeauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer\nwho is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high\nexpectations for the shopping experience. We estimate beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 65% of shoppers and 80% of beauty\nproducts and services spend in the U.S. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our\nfinancial performance.\nToday, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care\nproducts, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of approximately 25,000\nbeauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than\n1,350 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website,\nUlta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on\nproducts and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with\nwarm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels.\nThe continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to\nexecute our strategic priorities: 1) drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty; 2)\nevolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World; 3) expand and deepen our\npresence across the beauty journey, positioning Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community; 4) drive operational excellence and\noptimization; 5) protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent; and 6) expand our environmental and social impact. We believe the\nattractive and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the expanding definition of beauty and the role that omnichannel\ncapabilities play in consumers’ lives, coupled with Ulta Beauty’s competitive strengths, position us to capture additional market share in the\nindustry.\nComparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and\nwe expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic\nconditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.\nOver the long term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel\ncapabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate\nportfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies,\npartially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700\nstore chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.\nCurrent Trends\nIndustry trends\nOur research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. The overall\nbeauty market expanded in 2022 and in 2023, supported by healthy consumer engagement with the\n36\nTable of Contents\nbeauty category. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our\nhighly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\nAlthough we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our sales during fiscal 2023, continued pressure from inflation or other\nevolving macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and could lead to a recession. Furthermore,\ninflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross\nmargin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase\nwith higher costs. In addition, inflation could cause the interest rates on any future debt to remain at an elevated level or increase.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup\nof the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated\nreturns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we\nrecognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the\ncustomer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original\npurchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state\nsales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the\nguest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the\nprivate label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue\nrelated to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our\ncomparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-\ncomparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed\nfor part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the\ncurrent or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week\nof comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to\ncompare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate\ncomparable or same store sales.\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy.\nSeveral factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\n● the general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;\n● the introduction of new products or brands;\n● the location of new stores in existing store markets;\n● competition;\n● our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;\n● the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and\n● the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.\nCost of sales includes:\n● the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n37\nTable of Contents\n● distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and\ninsurance;\n● shipping and handling costs for e-commerce orders;\n● retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance,\ninsurance, and licenses;\n● salon services payroll and benefits; and\n● shrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nOur cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact\non cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other\nretailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include:\n● payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\n● advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n● occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;\n● stock-based compensation expense;\n● depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included\nin cost of sales; and\n● legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or\nother retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores\nincluding rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and\ngrand opening advertising.\nInterest (income) expense represents interest from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds\nand certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest\ncosts and facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument.

The Company’s fiscal years ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 (fiscal 2023), January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022), and January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2021) were 53, 52, and 52 week years,\nrespectively.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAs of February 3, 2024, we operated 1,385 stores across 50 states.

The net sales increase\nwas primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, an increase of $68.3 million in other revenue and the\nbenefit of an extra week of sales in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week of fiscal 2023 were approximately $181.9 million. The total\ncomparable sales increase of 5.7% in fiscal 2023, compared to an increase of 15.6% in fiscal 2022, was driven by a 7.4% increase in\ntransactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket.\n39\nTable of Contents\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $336.6 million, or 8.3%, to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2023, compared to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2022. Gross profit as\na percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 39.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to 39.6% in fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to:\n● 80 basis points of deleverage in merchandise margins driven by higher promotional activity and category mix, as well as lapping\nof benefits from price increases; and\n● 40 basis points of deleverage in inventory shrink; partially offset by\n● 50 basis points of leverage in other revenue primarily due to credit card income growth, an increase in royalty income from our\npartnership with Target, and higher loyalty point redemptions; and\n● 20 basis points of leverage of store fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $299.3 million, or 12.5%, to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percentage\nof net sales, SG&A expenses increased 50 basis points to 24.0% in fiscal 2023 compared to 23.5% in fiscal 2022. The deleverage of SG&A\nexpenses was primarily due to:\n● 60 basis points of deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments;\n● 20 basis points of deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments;\n● 10 basis points of deleverage of store expenses due to ongoing inflationary pressures; and\n● 10 basis points of deleverage due to higher marketing expenses; partially offset by\n● 50 basis points of leverage due to lower incentive compensation.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 19.7%, to $8.5 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $10.6 million in fiscal 2022.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income was $17.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $4.9 million in fiscal 2022, due to higher average interest rates on cash\nbalances. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $404.6 million in fiscal 2023 represents an effective tax rate of 23.9%, compared to fiscal 2022 income tax expense\nof $401.1 million and an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The lower income tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes\ncompared to fiscal 2022 and a tax benefit from the income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\nNet income\nNet income increased $48.6 million to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022. The increase in net income was\nprimarily due to a $336.6 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $299.3 million increase in SG&A expenses and a $3.5 million\nincrease in income taxes.\n40\nTable of Contents\nFiscal year 2022 versus fiscal year 2021\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $1.6 billion, or 18.3%, to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021. The net sales increase was\nprimarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands\nand product innovation, increased social occasions and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021, and an increase of $77.3\nmillion in other revenue. The total comparable sales increase of 15.6% in fiscal 2022, compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021, was\ndriven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $676.0 million, or 20.1%, to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2022, compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. Gross profit as\na percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 39.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 39.0% in fiscal 2021. The increase in gross profit\nmargin was primarily due to:\n● 100 basis points of leverage of fixed costs attributed to the impact of higher sales and ongoing occupancy cost optimization\nefforts;\n● 60 basis points of leverage in other revenue primarily due to credit card income growth, an increase in royalty income from our\npartnership with Target, and higher loyalty point redemptions; and\n● 20 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; partially offset by\n● 70 basis points of deleverage in inventory shrink; and\n● 50 basis points of deleverage in merchandise margins driven by brand mix and lapping benefits from favorable inventory reserve\nadjustments in fiscal 2021, partially offset by the timing of retail price changes.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $333.8 million, or 16.2%, to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percentage\nof net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 40 basis points to 23.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021. The leverage of SG&A\nexpenses was primarily due to:\n● 80 basis points of leverage due to lower marketing expenses; and\n● 20 basis points of leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales; partially offset by\n● 40 basis points of deleverage of corporate overhead primarily due to strategic investments; and\n● 20 basis points of deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses increased $1.1 million, or 11.4%, to $10.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021.\nInterest (income) expense, net\nInterest income, net was $4.9 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.7 million of interest expense, net in fiscal 2021. Interest income\nrepresents interest from cash equivalents and short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase.\nInterest expense represents interest on borrowings and fees related to the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our\ncredit facility as of January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $401.1 million in fiscal 2022 represents an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to fiscal 2021 income tax expense\nof $310.0 million and an effective tax rate of 23.9%. The higher income tax expense is primarily due\n41\nTable of Contents\nto less tax benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and an increase in state tax expense compared to fiscal\n2021.\nNet income\nNet income increased $256.6 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in net income\nwas primarily due to a $676.0 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $333.8 million increase in SG&A expenses and a $91.1\nmillion increase in income taxes.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. The\nmost significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories, cash and cash equivalents, and receivables, reduced by\naccounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued liabilities. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents\nof $766.6 million and $737.9 million, respectively.\nOur primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories\nrelated to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our\ninformation technology systems.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease\nexpenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures,\ninvestments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our\ninventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season.\nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.\nWe generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. We believe our primary sources of\nliquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term.\nThe following table summarizes contractual cash requirements as of February 3, 2024:\nLess Than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than 5\n(In thousands) Total 1 Year Years Years Years\nOperating lease obligations (1) $ 2,289,652 $ 351,517 $ 755,334 $ 545,888 $ 636,913\nPurchase obligations 55,587 39,954 15,633 — —\nTotal (2) $ 2,345,239 $ 391,471 $ 770,967 $ 545,888 $ 636,913\n(1) These amounts are for our undiscounted lease obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as operating lease liabilities.\nAlso included are legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced of $122.2 million, which are\nexcluded from operating lease liabilities shown on our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) The unrecognized tax benefit of $4.1 million as of February 3, 2024 is excluded due to uncertainty regarding the realization and\ntiming of the related future cash flows, if any.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPurchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by the Company to purchase goods or services. The amount of\npurchase obligations relates to commitments for products and services and other goods and service contracts entered into as of\nFebruary 3, 2024. Excluded from purchase obligations are normal purchases and contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nCash flows\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key\nstrengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows during the last three years:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,476,266 $ 1,481,915 $ 1,059,265\nNet cash used in investing activities (441,425) (314,584) (176,484)\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,006,124) (861,014) (1,497,216)\nOperating activities\nOperating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease\nexpense, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the\neffect of working capital changes.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is mainly due to the timing of accrued\nliabilities, accounts payable, receivable collections, prepaid income taxes, and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a larger\nincrease in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2023, partially offset by the increase in net income and non-cash lease expense.\nMerchandise inventories, net were $1.7 billion at February 3, 2024, compared to $1.6 billion at January 28, 2023, representing an increase\nof $138.7 million or 8.6%. The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:\n● $69 million increase due to new key brand launches;\n● $36 million increase due to the addition of 30 net new stores opened since January 28, 2023;\n● $15 million increase primarily due to inventory cost increases; and\n● $13 million increase in distribution center inventory primarily due to the opening of the new market fulfillment center in Greer,\nSC.\nThe increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales, partially offset by an increase in\nSG&A expenses and income taxes.\nThe increase in non-cash lease expense was primarily due to an increase in tenant allowances.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the increase in net\nincome, a smaller increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and the timing of receivable collections,\npartially offset by the timing of payables and a smaller increase in deferred revenue compared to fiscal 2021.\nInvesting activities\nWe have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term\ninvestments, and investments in information technology systems. Investment activities for capital expenditures were $435.3 million during\nfiscal 2023, compared to $312.1 million during fiscal 2022.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to more capital expenditures for\nnew, remodeled, and relocated stores and information technology systems compared to fiscal 2022.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to more capital expenditures for\nnew, remodeled, and relocated stores, supply chain, and information technology systems compared to fiscal 2021.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table presents a summary of our store activities during the last three years:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n2024 2023 2022\nStores opened 33 47 48\nStores remodeled 18 20 9\nStores relocated 7 12 7\nDuring fiscal 2023, the average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store was approximately $2.0 million, which includes\ncapital investment net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory net of payables.\nCapital expenditures during the last three years by major category are as follows:\nBudget\nFiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2022 2021\nNew, Remodeled, and Relocated Stores $ 218 $ 141 $ 102 $ 73\nMerchandising and Refreshed Stores 64 37 34 16\nInformation Technology Systems 80 124 74 37\nSupply Chain 75 73 70 23\nStore Maintenance and Other 53 60 32 23\nTotal $ 490 $ 435 $ 312 $ 172\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems\ninvestments, and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current\nexpectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures. We expect fiscal 2024 capital\nexpenditures will be up to $490 million and will be used primarily to fund our new, remodeled, and relocated stores and strategic priorities,\nincluding investments in information technology systems and supply chain optimization.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions.\nPurchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares\nwithheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in share\nrepurchases and less stock options exercised.\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in share\nrepurchases.\n44\nTable of Contents\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at the end of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. The zero outstanding borrowings\nposition is due to a combination of factors including sales demand, overall performance of management initiatives including expense\ncontrol, and inventory and other working capital reductions. We may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future\nperiods for unexpected business disruptions, to support our new store program, seasonal inventory needs, or share repurchases.\nShare repurchase program\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2020 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the\nCompany could repurchase up to $1.6 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked\nthe previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program did not\nhave an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the\nCompany could repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked\nthe previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2020 Share Repurchase Program. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program did not\nhave an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022\nShares repurchased 2,173,431 2,192,556 4,249,632\nTotal cost of shares repurchased $ 1,009.3 $ 900.0 $ 1,521.9\nOn March 12, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2024 Share Repurchase\nProgram) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The 2024\nShare Repurchase Program authorization revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2022 Share\nRepurchase Program. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or\ndiscontinued at any time.\nCredit facility\nOn March 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan\nAgreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo\nBank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nSyndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party\nthereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 13, 2029, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $800.0 million or a\npercentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows\nthe Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $200.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions.\nThe Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when\navailability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral\nfor outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Company’s election, at either a base\nrate plus a margin of 0.5% to 1.0% or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.0%, and a credit spread\nadjustment of 0.10%, with such margins based on the Company’s borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.25% to 0.375% per\nannum.\n45\nTable of Contents\nAs of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with\nall terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the\nfiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day. Any\ndecrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating\nresults for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As\nsuch, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future\nperformance.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements\nrequired the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management\nbases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these\nestimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant estimates follows.\nManagement has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors.\nInventory valuation\nMerchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving average cost method\nand includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns,\nand volume discounts. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we\nexpect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory as well as for any excess or discontinued inventory. These estimates are\nbased on management’s judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or\nmarket conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be affected by adjustments to\nthese estimates.\nInventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink reserve\nrepresenting management’s estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. This\nestimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results, including consideration of current loss rates.\nWe do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to\ncalculate our inventory reserves. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the inventory reserves have\nbeen insignificant during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. An increase or decrease in the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve of 10%\nwould not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2023. An increase or decrease in the shrink rate included in the shrink\nreserve calculation of 10% would not have a material impact on our operating income for fiscal 2023.\nVendor allowances\nThe majority of cash consideration received from a vendor is considered to be a reduction of the cost of the related products and is reflected\nin cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income as the related products are sold unless it is in exchange for an asset or service or a\nreimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendors’ products. We estimate the\namount recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on a detailed analysis of inventory turns and management’s\nanalysis of the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors. We record cash consideration expected to be\nreceived from vendors in\n46\nTable of Contents\nreceivables. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use\nto calculate our reduction of inventory. An increase or decrease in inventory turns of five basis points would not have a material impact on\nour operating income for fiscal 2023.\nImpairment of long-lived tangible assets\nWe review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable. Assets are primarily\nreviewed at the store level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Significant estimates are used in determining\nfuture operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. An impairment loss would be recorded if the carrying amount of the\nlong-lived asset exceeds its fair value. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future\nestimates or assumptions we use to calculate our impairment charges. No impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2023, 2022, and\n2021.\nLoyalty program\nWe maintain a customer loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise\nor services. Points earned are valid for at least one year. The loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be\nredeemed on future products and services. Revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points\nexpire. We defer revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed. The amount of deferred revenue includes estimates for\nthe standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed. The expected redemption\npercentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends. The standalone selling price of points\nearned and the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be\na material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the estimated redemption rate.\nAdjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management’s estimates of the redemption rates have been insignificant during fiscal\n2023, 2022 and 2021. An increase or decrease in the estimated redemption rate of 5% would not have a material impact on our operating\nincome in fiscal 2023.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax\nassets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured\nusing enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or\nsettled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of\nenactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized\nunless it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized in full. The estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is recorded in\nour consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand\nchallenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, “Summary of significant accounting policies – Recent accounting pronouncements not\nyet adopted.”\n47\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.\nOur market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We continually monitor this risk and may develop strategies\nto manage it. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon\nvariable rates. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on our credit facility as of February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, or January 29,\n2022.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of February 3, 2024 and January 28,\n2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended February 3, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in\nall material respects, the financial position of the Company at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, and the consolidated results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated\nMarch 26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit\nmatter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating\nthe critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nLoyalty Program\nDescription of the The Company maintains a loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, which offers members the ability to earn and\nmatter redeem points on purchases of products and services. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when members redeem points or points expire. The\nCompany estimates the amount of revenue to defer using the standalone selling price of the points earned and the\nexpected redemption percentage. The Company evaluates its estimated standalone selling price quarterly based on\nthe value of products or services purchased using points. The expected redemption percentage is based on historical\nredemption patterns in conjunction with current information and trends.\nAuditing the Company’s estimate of loyalty deferred revenue was complex as the calculation involved\nmanagement’s assumptions, such as the standalone selling price and expected redemption rate, which drive the\nrevenue deferral. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to these significant assumptions, which are affected by\nexpectations about future customer behavior.\nHow we addressed We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s\nthe matter in our estimation process and controls supporting the measurement and recognition of the amount of loyalty revenue\naudit deferred. This included testing controls over management’s review of the assumptions and other inputs used in the\nestimation, the completeness and accuracy of issuance, redemption, and expiration data used in the calculation, and\ncontrols over the assignment of membership levels based on customer spending patterns.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, analyzing the significant\nassumptions discussed above, and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in\nmanagement’s calculation. To test the standalone selling price per point, we validated that the price per point for\neach membership level was appropriate based on products or services purchased by loyalty members. In addition,\nwe tested the value of points redeemed was complete and accurate. To audit the redemption rate, we tested the\nissuance and redemption activity and compared the results of that testing to the redemption rate used by\nmanagement in its estimate. We also considered recent trends in redemption activity and the impact on the\nredemption rate. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in\nthe deferral amounts.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 26, 2024\n51\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders’ and the Board of Directors Ulta Beauty, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ulta Beauty, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)\n(the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ulta Beauty, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of February 3, 2024, based on COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2024, and the\nrelated notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated March 26, 2024 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s annual report on internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n52\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 26, 2024\n53\nTable of Contents\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nFebruary 3, January

count data)\n1. Business and basis of presentation\nUlta Beauty, Inc. was founded in 1990 to operate specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and\nrelated accessories and services. Nearly every store features a full-service salon. As used in these notes and throughout this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ulta Beauty,” or the “Company” refer to Ulta Beauty, Inc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. All amounts are stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.\nAs of February 3, 2024, the Company operated 1,385 stores across 50 states.\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\nFiscal year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company’s fiscal years ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 (fiscal 2023), January 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022), and January 29, 2022 (fiscal 2021) were 53, 52, and 52 week years,\nrespectively.\nConsolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant\nintercompany accounts, transactions, and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived\ntangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management\nestimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic\nenvironment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n59\nTable of Contents\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of\nthree months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents also include amounts due from third-party financial institutions for credit\ncard and debit card transactions. These receivables typically settle in five days or less with little or no default risk.\nFebruary 3, January 28,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCash $ 677,004 $ 651,367\nReceivables from third-party financial institutions for credit card and debit card transactions 89,590 86,510\nCash and cash equivalents $ 766,594 $ 737,877\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short\nmaturities of these instruments. There was no outstanding debt as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.\nReceivables\nReceivables primarily include amounts due from vendors for allowances, royalties and other credit card amounts, and amounts due from\nthird-party gift card providers. The Company does not require collateral on its receivables and does not accrue interest. Credit risk with\nrespect to receivables is limited due to the diversity of vendors comprising the Company’s vendor base. The Company performs ongoing\ncredit evaluations of its vendors and evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the length of time the receivable is past due and\nhistorical experience.\nFebruary 3, January 28,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nVendor allowances $ 140,356 $ 109,899\nRoyalties and other credit card 24,818 19,738\nGift card 11,694 42,065\nOther 31,706 28,796\nAllowance for doubtful accounts (635) (1,076)\nReceivables, net $ 207,939 $ 199,422\nVendor allowances\nThe Company receives consideration from vendors for advertising, markdown allowances, purchase volume discounts and rebates,\nreimbursement for defective merchandise, and certain selling and display expenses. A majority of all vendor allowances are recorded as a\nreduction of the vendor’s product cost and recognized in cost of sales as the product is sold.\nMerchandise inventories\nMerchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving average cost method\nand includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods. Inventory cost also includes vendor allowances related to co-op advertising,\nmarkdowns, and volume discounts. The Company maintains an inventory reserve for lower of cost or net realizable value and shrink. The\ninventory reserve was $45,360 and $39,532 as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\n60\nTable of Contents\nProperty and equipment and internal use software\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of\nthe assets’ estimated useful lives or lease term. Leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term are\namortized over the shorter of the assets’ useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term, plus any renewals that are reasonably\ncertain at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nEquipment and fixtures 1 to 10 years\nElectronic equipment and software 3 to 15 years\nCosts incurred to obtain or develop internal use software that are capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlife of the software.\nCloud computing arrangements\nCloud computing arrangements (software-as-a-service contracts) and related implementation costs that are capitalized are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over the contract term (1 month to 5 years). These amounts are classified within prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets\nThe asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of\nother groups of assets. The asset group identified is at the store level and includes both property and equipment and operating lease assets.\nSignificant estimates are used in determining future cash flows of each store over its remaining lease term including our expectations of\nfuture projected cash flows including revenues and operating expenses. An impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the long-\nlived asset exceeds its fair value.\nLong-lived tangible and right-of-use assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment quarterly or when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed over the asset group. Asset\ngroups are written down only to the extent that their carrying value exceeds their respective fair value. Fair values of the asset group are\ndetermined by discounting the cash flows at a rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant. Management’s forecast of\nfuture cash flows is based on the income approach. The fair value of individual right-of-use assets is determined under the market approach\nusing estimated market rent assessments based on broker quotes.\nThe determination of fair value under the income approach requires assumptions including forecasts of future cash flows (such as revenue\ngrowth rates and operating expenses) and selection of a market-based discount rate. Estimates of market rent are based on non-binding\nbroker quotes. As these inputs are unobservable, they are classified as Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. If actual results are not\nconsistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, there may be exposure to additional\nimpairment losses in a future period.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. The recoverability of goodwill is reviewed annually during\nthe fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist (see Note 6,\n“Goodwill”).\n61\nTable of Contents\nOther intangible assets\nOther definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The recoverability of intangible assets is reviewed whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable (see Note 7, “Other intangible\nassets”).\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The lease classification evaluation begins at\nthe lease commencement date. The lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the\nright to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain.\nTotal rent payable is recorded during the lease term, including rent escalations in which the amount of future rent is fixed on the straight-\nline basis over the term of the lease (including the rent holiday period beginning upon control of the premises and any fixed payments\nstated in the lease). For leases with an initial term greater than 12 months, a related lease liability is recorded on the balance sheet at the\npresent value of future payments discounted at the estimated fully collateralized incremental borrowing rate (discount rate) corresponding\nwith the lease term. In addition, a right-of-use asset is recorded as the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to\nthe lessor before or at the lease commencement date and any initial direct costs incurred, less any tenant improvement allowance incentives\nreceived. Tenant incentives are amortized through the right-of-use asset as reduction of rent expense over the lease term. The difference\nbetween the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent is reflected within the right-of-use asset.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require variable payments based upon sales volume or payment of common area maintenance costs,\nreal estate taxes, and insurance related to leases (variable lease cost). Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. This results in some\nvariability in lease expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in stores where variable lease costs are paid. Contingent\nrent is accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred, in addition to the straight-line rent expense. This results in some variability in\nlease expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in stores where contingent rent is paid.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recorded on the balance sheet. Short-term lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company subleases certain real estate to third parties for stores with excess square footage space.\nThe Company does not separate lease and non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance).\nAs the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate corresponding with\nthe lease term. As there are no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s credit facility, this rate is estimated based on prevailing market\nconditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and judgment. The incremental borrowing rate is reassessed if there is a change to the\nlease term or if a modification occurs and it is not accounted for as a separate contract (see Note 8, “Leases”).\nLoyalty program\nThe Company maintains a loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, which allows members to earn points based on purchases of merchandise\nor services. Points earned are valid for at least one year. The loyalty program represents a material right to the customer and points may be\nredeemed on future products and services. Revenue from the loyalty program is recognized when the members redeem points or points\nexpire. The Company defers revenue related to points earned that have not yet been redeemed. The amount of deferred revenue includes\nestimates for the standalone selling price of points earned by members and the percentage of points expected to be redeemed. The expected\nredemption percentage is based on historical redemption patterns and considers current information or trends. The standalone selling price\nof points earned and the estimated redemption rate is evaluated each reporting period. When a guest redeems points or the points expire, the\nCompany recognizes revenue in net sales on the consolidated statements of income.\n62\nTable of Contents\nCredit cards\nThe Company has agreements (the Agreements) with third parties to provide guests with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit\ncards (collectively, the Credit Cards). The private label credit card can be used at any store location and online, and the co-branded credit\ncard can be used anywhere the co-branded card is accepted. A third-party financing company is the sole owner of the accounts and\nunderwrites the credit issued under the Credit Card programs. The Company’s performance obligation is to maintain the Ulta Beauty\nRewards loyalty program as only guests enrolled in the loyalty program can apply for the Credit Cards. Loyalty members earn points\nthrough purchases at Ulta Beauty, Ulta Beauty at Target, and anywhere the co-branded credit card is accepted.\nThe third parties reimburse the Company for certain credit card program costs such as advertising and loyalty points, which help promote\nthe credit card program. The Company recognizes revenue when collectability is reasonably assured, under the assumption the amounts are\nnot constrained and it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which is generally the time at which\nthe actual usage of the Credit Cards or specified transaction occurs.\nThe Company accounts for the amounts associated with the Agreements as a single contract with the sole commercial objective to maintain\nthe Credit Card programs. As a result, all amounts associated with the Agreements are recognized within net sales on the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nGift card program\nThe Company records a contract liability for gift card sales which will be redeemed in the future within deferred revenue on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and recognized in net sales when the gift card is redeemed for product or services. Gift cards do not expire and\ndo not include service fees that decrease guest balances. The Company maintains historical data related to gift card transactions sold and\nredeemed over a significant time frame. Gift card breakage (amounts not expected to be redeemed) is recognized to the extent there is no\nrequirement for remitting balances to governmental agencies under unclaimed property laws. Estimated gift card breakage revenue is\nrecognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. Gift card breakage revenue was $22,606, $18,835, and $15,266 in fiscal\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the guest, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n● Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a guest;\n● Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n● Determination of the transaction price;\n● Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n● Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue.\nRevenue from merchandise sales at retail stores is recognized at the point of sale, net of estimated returns. Revenue from e-commerce\nmerchandise sales is recognized upon shipment to the guest or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control\ncriteria, net of estimated returns. Salon services revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Shipping and\nhandling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue\nfor its single performance obligation related to e-commerce sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at\nthe time of shipment or guest pickup. The Company provides refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase\ndate. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and\n63\nTable of Contents\nremitting state sales tax. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the point of sale.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs primarily consist of print, digital and social media, and television and radio advertising, net of vendor income that is a\nreimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs. Costs related to advertising are expensed in the period the related\npromotional event occurs.\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nAdvertising expense, net $ 422,779 $ 374,730 $ 387,794\nAdvertising expense, net as a percentage of net sales 3.8% 3.7% 4.5%\nPrepaid advertising costs included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were $12,708 and $9,466\nas of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nPre-opening expenses\nNon-capital expenditures incurred prior to the grand opening of a new, remodeled, or relocated store are expensed as incurred.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and\nidentifiable costs; distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes,\nutilities, and insurance; shipping and handling costs; retail stores occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate\ntaxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses; salon services payroll and benefits; and shrink and inventory valuation\nreserves.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses includes payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\nadvertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs; occupancy\ncosts related to our corporate office facilities; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those\nrelated to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems, and other\ncorporate overhead costs.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities and their tax bases. The amounts reported were derived using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nIncome tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that\neach uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Penalties\nand interest related to unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 11,\n“Income taxes”).\n64\nTable of Contents\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense was $48,246, $43,044, and $47,259 in\nfiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively (see Note 15, “Stock-based compensation”).\nInsurance expense\nThe Company has insurance programs with third party insurers for employee health, workers compensation, and general liability, among\nothers, to limit the Company’s liability exposure. The insurance programs are premium based and include retentions, deductibles, and stop\nloss coverage. Current stop loss coverage per claim is $400 for employee health claims, $350 for general liability claims, and $350 for\nworkers compensation claims. The Company makes collateral and premium payments during the plan year and accrues expenses in the\nevent additional premium is due from the Company based on actual claim results. UB Insurance, Inc., an Arizona-based wholly owned\ncaptive insurance subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiaries of the Company premiums to insure certain liability\nexposures. Pursuant to Arizona insurance regulations, UB Insurance, Inc. maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its\nliability exposures.\nNet income per common share\nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\nshares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share includes dilutive common stock equivalents,\nusing the treasury stock method (see Note 16, “Net income per common share”).\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure. The guidance updates reportable segment disclosure\nrequirements, primarily through requiring enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment\nperformance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on related disclosures.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.

Options are granted with the\nexercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. As of February 3, 2024, the plan reserves for the issuance\nupon grant or exercise of awards up to 2,281 shares of common stock.\nThe following table presents information related to stock-based compensation:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nStock options $ 7,429 $ 7,250 $ 11,245\nRestricted stock units 19,724 18,483 19,286\nPerformance-based restricted stock units 21,093 17,311 16,728\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 48,246 $ 43,044 $ 47,259\nCash received from stock option exercises $ 12,176 $ 46,011 $ 40,386\nIncome tax benefit $ 7,167 $ 3,829 $ 7,088\nStock options\nStock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense\nis recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The estimated grant date fair value of\nstock options was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the periods\nindicated:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n2024 2023 2022\nVolatility rate 45.0% 49.0% 46.9%\nAverage risk-free interest rate 3.8% 2.4% 0.4%\nAverage expected life (in years) 3.4 3.4 3.9\nDividend yield — — —\nThe expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the\nUnited States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents\nthe time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on Ulta\nBeauty stock option exercises. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of stock option activity\nand reduce the stock-based compensation expense recognized. The Company does not currently pay a regular dividend.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information related to common stock options:\nFiscal year ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n(In thousands, except weighted-average grant date fair value) 2024 2023 2022\nWeighted-average grant date fair value $ 199.15 $ 149.14 $ 109.84\nFair value of options vested 7,169 9,525 10,417\nIntrinsic value of options exercised 15,509 42,489 39,489\nAt February 3, 2024, there was approximately $10,498 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock\noptions.

For the complete terms of our common stock and preferred stock, please refer to our certificate of incorporation and\nbylaws. The terms of these securities may also be affected by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). The\nsummary below is qualified in its entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as such may be\namended from time to time.\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and\n70,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.\nCommon Stock\nExcept as otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in any certificate of designation for any series of\npreferred stock, the holders of common stock possess all voting power for the election of our directors and all other\nmatters requiring stockholder action. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on\nby stockholders. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors. Our common stockholders have\nno preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to our\ncommon stock.\nSubject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, holders of common stock\nare entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash, property or shares of our stock as may be declared\nfrom time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of assets or funds legally available therefor. In the event of\nany dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of our affairs, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment or provision for\npayment of our debts and other liabilities and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of\npreferred stock, our remaining assets and funds, if any, shall be divided among and paid ratably to the holders of our\ncommon stock in proportion to the number of shares held by them.\nPreferred Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that shares of our preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one\nor more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the\nrelative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof,\napplicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred\nstock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the\ncommon stock and could have anti-takeover effects.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control,\ndiscourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the\nholders of our common stock. These provisions include:\n• authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock\nwithout stockholder approval;\n• prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n• prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; and\n• requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, that, in general, prohibits\nany business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after the\nstockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified exceptions.\nTogether, these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make the\nremoval of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a\npremium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\n2\nExhibit 10.2\nExecution Version\nAMENDMENT NO. 3 TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT\nThis AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT\n(this “Amendment”) dated as of March 13, 2024 is by and among ULTA BEAUTY, INC., a Delaware corporation\n(“Holdings”), ULTA SALON, COSMETICS & FRAGRANCE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower\nRepresentative”), ULTA INC., a Delaware corporation (“Ulta Inc.”), ULTA BEAUTY CREDIT SERVICES\nCORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (“Ulta Credit”), ULTA BEAUTY COSMETICS, LLC, a Florida limited\nliability company (“Ulta Cosmetics”), UB MEDIA, INC., a Delaware corporation (“UB Media”), ULTA BEAUTY\nDISTRIBUTION, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“UBD”, and together with Holdings, the Borrower\nRepresentative, Ulta Inc., Ulta Credit, Ulta Cosmetics, and UB Media, each a “Borrower” and collectively, the\n“Borrowers”), the financial institutions party hereto as lenders (“Lenders”) and WELLS FARGO BANK,\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION, in its capacities as administrative agent and as collateral agent for the Lenders (the\n“Agent”) and in its individual capacity (“Wells Fargo”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein:\n(1) Revolving Loans. Each Revolving Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment agrees to make loans to the\nBorrowers (“Revolving Loans”) from time to time during the Availability Period in amounts not to exceed (except\nfor the Swingline Lender with respect to Swingline Loans) such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage\nof the Borrowing Base, and in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) such Revolving Lender’s\nRevolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment, (ii) the\ntotal Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding the total Revolving Facility Commitments, or\n70\n(iii) the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding the Line Cap. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the\nterms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.\n(2) Overadvances. Insofar as the Borrowers may request and the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders may be\nwilling in their sole discretion to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers at a time when the Revolving Facility\nCredit Exposure exceeds, or would exceed with the making of any such Revolving Loan, the Borrowing Base (any\nsuch Loan being herein referred to individually as an “Overadvance”), the Administrative Agent will enter such\nOveradvances as debits in the applicable Loan Account. All Overadvances will be repaid on demand, will be secured\nby the Collateral and will bear interest as provided in this Agreement for Revolving Loans generally. Any\nOveradvance made pursuant to the terms hereof will be made to the Borrowers by all Revolving Lenders ratably in\naccordance with their respective Revolving Facility Percentages. Overadvances, together with outstanding Protective\nAdvances, in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10.0% of the Borrowing Base may be made in the sole, reasonable\ndiscretion of the Administrative Agent; provided that the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the\nAdministrative Agent’s authorization to make future Overadvances; provided that no existing Overadvances will be\nsubject to such revocation and any such revocation must be in writing and will become effective prospectively upon\nthe Administrative Agent’s receipt thereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no event, unless otherwise consented\nto by all Revolving Lenders will:\n(a) any Overadvances be outstanding for more than 90 consecutive days;\n(b) the Administrative Agent or Lenders make any additional Overadvances unless 30 days or more have expired\nsince the last date on which any Overadvances were outstanding; or\n(c) the Administrative Agent make Revolving Loans on behalf of Revolving Lenders under this Section 2.01(2)\nto the extent such Revolving Loans would cause a Revolving Lender’s share of the applicable Revolving\nFacility Credit Exposure to exceed such Lender’s applicable Revolving Facility Commitment or cause the\naggregate applicable Revolving Facility Commitments to be exceeded.\n(3) Protective Advances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative\nAgent, in its sole, reasonable discretion, may make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of, the Borrowers, on\nbehalf of the Revolving Lenders having Revolving Facility Commitments, so long as the aggregate outstanding\namount of such Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate outstanding amount of the Overadvances, does not\nexceed 10.0% of the Borrowing Base, if the Administrative Agent, in its Reasonable Credit Judgment, deems that\nsuch Revolving Loans are necessary or desirable to:\n(a) protect all or any portion of the Collateral;\n(b) enhance the likelihood or maximize the amount of repayment of the Loans and the other Obligations; or\n(c) pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement (the Revolving Loans\ndescribed in this Section 2.01(3), “Protective Advances”);\nprovided that (i) with respect to Protective Advances, in no event will the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceed the\naggregate Revolving Facility Commitments and (ii) the Required Lenders under the Revolving Facility may at any time\nrevoke the Administrative Agent’s authorization to make future\n71\nProtective Advances; provided, further, that any such revocation must be in writing and will become effective prospectively\nupon the Administrative Agent’s receipt thereof and existing Protective Advances will not be subject to thereto.\nEach applicable Revolving Lender will be obligated to advance to the Borrowers its applicable Revolving Facility Percentage\nof each Protective Advance made in accordance with this Section 2.01(3). If Protective Advances are made in accordance\nwith the preceding sentence, then all Revolving Lenders will be bound to make, or permit to remain outstanding, such\nProtective Advances based upon their applicable Revolving Facility Percentages in accordance with the terms of this\nAgreement. All Protective Advances will be repaid by the applicable Borrowers on demand, will be secured by the Collateral\nand will bear interest as provided in this Agreement for Revolving Loans generally. No Protective Advance may remain\noutstanding for more than forty-five (45) days without the consent of the Required Lenders.\n(4) Reserves. The Administrative Agent may at any time and from time to time in the exercise of its Reasonable Credit\nJudgment establish and increase or decrease Reserves in accordance with the terms of the definition thereof.\nSECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings.\n(1) Each Loan will be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in\naccordance with their respective Commitments (or, in the case of Swingline Loans, in accordance with their\nrespective Swingline Commitments). The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it will not\nrelieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and\nno Lender will be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.\n(2) Subject to Section 2.14, each Borrowing (other than a Swingline Borrowing) will be comprised entirely of ABR\nLoans or SOFR Loans as the Borrowers may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Borrowing will be an\nABR Borrowing. Each Lender at its option may make any ABR Loan or SOFR Loan by causing any domestic or\nforeign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option will not\naffect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such\nLender will not be entitled to any amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17 solely in respect of increased costs\nresulting from such exercise and existing at the time of such exercise.\n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower will be entitled to request, or to elect to convert\nor continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.\nSECTION 2.03 Requests for Borrowings; Interest Elections.\n(1) Each request for an ABR Borrowing shall be made no later than 2:00 p.m. New York City time, on the Business Day\nof the proposed date of Borrowing by electronic request of the Borrower Representative through Administrative\nAgent’s Commercial Electronic Office Portal or through such other electronic portal provided by Administrative\nAgent (the “Portal”). The Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that any request made through the Portal shall\nbe deemed made by a Responsible Officer of Borrower Representative and may designate the Borrower for whose\naccount the ABR Borrowing is being requested. Each request for a SOFR Borrowing or request to continue a SOFR\nBorrowing shall be made pursuant to Borrower Representative’s submission of a SOFR Loan Notice to\nAdministrative Agent, which must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days\n72\nprior to the requested date of any SOFR Borrowing or continuation of SOFR Loans. Each SOFR Loan Notice shall\nspecify (a) the requested date of the Borrowing or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day),\n(b) the principal amount of the SOFR Loans to be borrowed or continued (which shall be in a principal amount of at\nleast the Borrowing Minimum or a Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof) and may designate the Borrower for whose\naccount the SOFR Borrowing is being requested, (c) the duration of the Interest Period will respect thereto and (d)\nany outstanding ABR Loans that are requested to be converted to a SOFR Loan. If the Borrower Representative fails\nto elect an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. On the requested date\nof any SOFR Borrowing, (i) in the event that ABR Loans are outstanding in an amount equal to or greater than the\nrequested SOFR Loan, all or a portion of such ABR Loans shall be automatically converted into a SOFR Loan in the\namount requested by the Borrower Representative and (ii) if ABR Loans are not outstanding in an amount at least\nequal to the requested SOFR Loan, the Borrower Representative shall make an electronic request via the Portal for\nadditional ABR Loans in such amount, when taken with the outstanding ABR Loans (which shall be converted\nautomatically at such time), as is necessary to satisfy the requested SOFR Loan. If the Borrower Representative fails\nto make such additional request via the Portal as required pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence, then the\nBorrowers shall be responsible for all amounts due pursuant to Section 2.16 hereof arising on account of such failure.\nIf the Borrower Representative fails to give a timely notice with respect to any continuation of a SOFR Loan, then\nthe applicable Loans shall be converted to ABR Loans, effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect\nwith respect to the applicable SOFR Loans.\n(2) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its share of the applicable Loans, and if\nno timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower Representative, the Administrative\nAgent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to ABR Loans described above.\n(3) Except as otherwise provided herein, a SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest\nPeriod for such SOFR Loan. During the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested\nas, converted to or continued as SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.\n(4) The Administrative Agent, without the request of any Borrower, may advance any interest, fee, service charge\n(including direct wire fees), expenses of the Loan Parties pursuant to Section 10.05 of this Agreement, or other\npayment to which any Agent or Lender is entitled from the Loan Parties pursuant hereto or any other Loan Document\nand may charge the same to any Loan Account notwithstanding that an Overadvance may result thereby. The\nAdministrative Agent shall advise the Borrower Representative of any such advance or charge promptly after the\nmaking thereof. Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the\nAdministrative Agent’s rights and the Borrowers’ obligations under Section 2.11(1). Any amount which is charged to\na Loan Account as provided in this Section 2.03(4) shall constitute Revolving Loans and shall bear interest at the\ninterest rate then and thereafter applicable to ABR Loans.\n(5) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower Representative and the Lenders of the interest rate\napplicable to any Interest Period for SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.\n(6) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of\nLoans as the same Type, there shall not be more than twelve Interest Periods in effect with respect to SOFR Loans.\n73\nSECTION 2.04 Swingline Loans.\n(1) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make (x) Swingline Loans to\nthe Borrowers from time to time during the Availability Period; provided, that no such Swingline Loan will be\npermitted if, after giving effect thereto, (a) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans would\nexceed the Swingline Commitment; or (b) the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure would exceed the Borrowing Base;\nprovided; that the Swingline Lender will not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding\nSwingline Borrowing. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the\nBorrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.\n(2) To request a Swingline Borrowing, the Borrowers will notify the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender of\nsuch request by telephone (confirmed by a Swingline Borrowing Request by email or facsimile), not later than 2:00\np.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Borrowing. Each such notice and Swingline\nBorrowing Request will be irrevocable and will specify the requested (a) date (which will be a Business Day), and\n(b) amount of the Swingline Borrowing and may designate the Borrower for whose account the ABR Borrowing is\nbeing requested. The Swingline Lender will consult with the Administrative Agent as to whether the making of the\nSwingline Loan is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Swingline Lender funding such\nSwingline Loan. The Swingline Lender will make each Swingline Loan in accordance with Section 2.02(2) on the\nproposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, to the\naccount of the applicable Borrowers (or, in the case of a Swingline Borrowing made to finance the reimbursement of\nan L/C Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(5), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank); provided that the\nSwingline Lender will not be obligated to make any Swingline Loan at any time when any Lender is at such time a\nDefaulting Lender, unless the Swingline Lender (i) is satisfied in its reasonable discretion that the related exposure\nwill be 100% covered by the applicable Revolving Facility Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to\nclause (3) below or (ii) has otherwise entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender to\neliminate the Swingline Lender’s risk with respect to such Lender.\n(3) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent on any Business Day require the\nRevolving Lenders with Revolving Facility Commitments to acquire participations by 2:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on such Business Day in all or a portion of the outstanding Swingline Loans made by it. Such notice will\nspecify the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans in which the applicable Revolving Lenders will participate.\nPromptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each such Revolving\nLender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Lender’s applicable Revolving Facility Percentage of such\nSwingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of\nnotice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender, such\nRevolving Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender\nacknowledges and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this\nparagraph is absolute and unconditional and will not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the\noccurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and\nthat each such payment will be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each\nRevolving Lender will comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available\nfunds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and\nSection 2.06 will apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent\nwill promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.\n74\n(4) The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrowers of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to\nparagraph (3)(a), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan will be made to the Administrative\nAgent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or\nother party on behalf of the Borrowers) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the\nproceeds of a sale of participations therein will be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent and any such\namounts received by the Administrative Agent will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the\nRevolving Lenders that made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their\ninterests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted will be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the\nAdministrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrowers for\nany reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to paragraph (3)(a) will not relieve the\nBorrowers of any default in the payment thereof.\n(5) If the Maturity Date in respect of any tranche of Revolving Facility Commitments occurs at a time when Extended\nCommitments are in effect, then (i) on such Maturity Date all then outstanding Swingline Loans shall be repaid in\nfull on such date (and there shall be no adjustment to the participations in such Swingline Loans as a result of the\noccurrence of such Maturity Date) or refinanced with a borrowing of an Extension pursuant to Section 2.22; provided\nthat, if on the occurrence of the such Maturity Date (after giving effect to any repayments of Revolving Loans and\nany reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as contemplated in Section 2.05), there shall exist sufficient\nunutilized Extended Commitments so that the respective outstanding Swingline Loans could be incurred pursuant to\nthe Extended Commitments which will remain in effect after the occurrence of such Maturity Date, then there shall\nbe an automatic adjustment on such date of the participations in such Swingline Loans and same shall be deemed to\nhave been incurred solely pursuant to the Extended Commitments and such Swingline Loans shall not be so required\nto be repaid in full on such Maturity Date.\nSECTION 2.05 Letters of Credit.\n(1) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may request the issuance of Standby\nLetters of Credit or Trade Letters of Credit issued for any lawful purposes of any Loan Party (such letters of credit\nissued for such purposes, “Letters of Credit”), for their own account or for the account of any Subsidiary (provided\nthat if such Subsidiary is not a Borrower, a Borrower shall be a co-applicant thereto), in a form reasonably acceptable\nto the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period and prior to the date\nthat is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and\nconditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other\nagreement submitted by any of the Borrowers to, or entered into by any of the Borrowers with, an Issuing Bank\nrelating to any Letter of Credit, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and\nconstrued, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable\nconflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.05 shall control and govern.\n(2) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension.\n(a) Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal (other than an automatic\nextension in accordance with paragraph (3) of this Section 2.05) or extension of an outstanding Letter of\nCredit), shall be irrevocable and the Borrowers will deliver by telefacsimile or other electronic method of\ntransmission reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank (including by e-mail, if arrangements for doing so\nhave been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative\nAgent three\n75\nBusiness Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension (or such shorter period\nas the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank in their sole discretion may agree) (i) a Letter of Credit\nRequest requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or\nextended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment or extension (which will be a Business Day), the\ndate on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which will comply with paragraph (3) of this Section 2.05),\nthe amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, identifying whether\nsuch Letter of Credit is a Standby Letter of Credit or a Trade Letter of Credit, and such other information\n(including the conditions to drawing) as is necessary to issue, amend or extend such Letter of Credit.

The Administrative Agent’s records of the content of any such request will be\nconclusive absent manifest error. A Letter of Credit will be issued or arranged, amended or extended in the\nIssuing Bank’s discretion and only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit,\nthe Borrowers will be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment\nor extension:\n(i) the Revolving L/C Exposure will not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit; and\n(ii) the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure will not exceed the Line Cap;\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Issuing Bank will not issue or arrange (or be\nobligated to issue or arrange) any Letter of Credit if:\n(i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator by its terms purports to\nenjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing or arranging such Letter of Credit;\n(ii) any applicable law or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any\nGovernmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank prohibits the issuance of letters of\ncredit generally;\n(iii) such Letter of Credit imposes upon the Issuing Bank any restriction, reserve or capital requirement\n(for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing\nDate;\n(iv) such Letter of Credit imposes upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense and\nwhich the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;\n(v) any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Bank (A) is satisfied in its\nreasonable discretion that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Facility\nCommitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.23(1) or (B) has otherwise\nentered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing\nBank’s risk with respect to such Lender;\n(vi) such Letter of Credit issuance would cause such Issuing Bank’s Revolving L/C Exposure to exceed\nsuch Issuing Bank’s Letter of Credit Commitments; or\n76\n(vii) issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Bank applicable\nto letters of credit generally\n(3) Expiration Date.\n(a) Each Standby Letter of Credit will expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one\nyear (unless otherwise agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank in their sole discretion)\nafter the date of issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension thereof, one year\n(unless otherwise agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank in their sole discretion)\nafter such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date;\nprovided that any Standby Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the automatic extension\nthereof for additional one-year periods (which will in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the\npreceding clause (ii)) so long as such Standby Letter of Credit permits the Issuing Bank to prevent any such\nextension at least once in each 12-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Standby\nLetter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof within a time period during such 12-month\nperiod to be agreed upon at the time such Standby Letter of Credit is issued; provided, further, that if the\nIssuing Bank and the Administrative Agent each consent in their sole discretion, the expiration date of any\nStandby Letter of Credit may extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above; and, provided, further,\nthat (A) if any such Standby Letter of Credit is outstanding or is issued after the date that is 30 days prior to\nthe Maturity Date, the Borrowers will provide cash collateral pursuant to documentation reasonably\nsatisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Bank in an amount equal to 103% of the\nface amount of each such Standby Letter of Credit on or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to the Maturity\nDate or, if later, such date of issuance, and (B) each Revolving Lender’s participation in any undrawn\nStandby Letter of Credit that is outstanding on the Maturity Date will terminate on the Maturity Date.\n(b) Each Trade Letter of Credit will expire on the earlier of (i) 180 days after such Trade Letter of Credit’s date\nof issuance or (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.\n(4) Participations.

Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,\nfor the account of the Issuing Bank, its Revolving Facility Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by such\nIssuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the date due as provided in paragraph (5) of this Section 2.05,\nor of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving Lender\nacknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters\nof Credit is absolute and unconditional and will not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any\namendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of\nDefault or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment will be made without any\noffset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.\n(5) Reimbursement.\n77\n(a) If the applicable Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers\nwill reimburse such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C\nDisbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first Business Day after the Borrowers\nreceive notice under paragraph (8) of this Section 2.05 of such L/C Disbursement (or the second Business\nDay, if such notice is received after 12:00 noon, New York City time), together with accrued interest thereon\nfrom the date of such L/C Disbursement at the rate applicable to ABR Loans that are Revolving Loans;\nprovided that the Borrowers may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in\naccordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing of Revolving\nLoans or a Swingline Borrowing, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the\nBorrowers’ obligations to make such payment will be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR\nBorrowing or Swingline Borrowing.\n(b) If the applicable Borrowers fail to reimburse any L/C Disbursement when due, then the Administrative Agent\nwill promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank and each other applicable Revolving Lender of the\napplicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the applicable Borrowers in respect thereof and, in\nthe case of a Revolving Lender, such Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly following\nreceipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender will pay to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Facility\nPercentage of the payment then due from the applicable Borrowers in the same manner as provided in\nSection 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 will apply, mutatis mutandis, to\nthe payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the\napplicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Any payment made by a\nRevolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph (5) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement\n(other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Borrowing as contemplated above) will\nnot constitute a Loan and will not relieve the applicable Borrowers of their obligations to reimburse such L/C\nDisbursement.\n(c) Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to\nparagraph (5)(a), the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to\nthe extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to paragraph (5)(b) to reimburse such\nIssuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.\n(6) Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the applicable Borrowers to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in\nparagraph (5) of this Section 2.05 will be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and will be performed strictly in\naccordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of:\n(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision\ntherein;\n(b) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in\nany respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;\n(c) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other\ndocument that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;\n78\n(d) the Issuing Bank or any of its branches or Affiliates being the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit;\n(e) the Issuing Bank or any correspondent honoring a drawing against a drawing document up to the amount\navailable under any Letter of Credit even if such drawing document claims an amount in excess of the\namount available under the Letter of Credit;\n(f) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may\nhave at any time against any beneficiary, any assignee of proceeds, the Issuing Bank or any other Person;\n(g) the fact that any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or\n(h) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but\nfor the provisions of this Section 2.05, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff\nagainst the Borrowers’ obligations hereunder.\n(7) Limited Liability. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties,\nwill have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of\nCredit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred\nto in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any\ndraft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to\nmake a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes\nbeyond the control of such Issuing Bank, or any of the circumstances referred to in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of\nSection 2.05(6); provided that the foregoing will not be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing Bank from liability\nto the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of\nwhich are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that\nare determined by a final and binding decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by such\nIssuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a\nLetter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross\nnegligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank will be deemed to\nhave exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality\nthereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial\ncompliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept\nand make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or\ninformation to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in\nstrict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.\n(8) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank will, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all\ndocuments purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank will promptly\nnotify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative by telephone (confirmed by facsimile or e-mail) of\nany such demand for payment under a Letter of Credit and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C\nDisbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice will not relieve the\napplicable Borrowers of their obligations to reimburse such Issuing Bank and/or the Revolving Lenders with respect\nto any such L/C Disbursement (following receipt of notice from the Issuing Bank).\n79\n(9) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrowers reimburse\nsuch L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof will bear\ninterest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the\napplicable Borrowers reimburse such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving\nLoans; provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrowers when due pursuant to\nparagraph (5) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.13(3) will apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph will be\nfor the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any\nRevolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section 2.05 to reimburse such Issuing Bank will be for the\naccount of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment.\n(10) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the\nBorrowers, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative\nAgent will notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement\nbecomes effective, the applicable Borrowers will pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing\nBank pursuant to Section 2.12. From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (a) the successor Issuing\nBank will have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to\nLetters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (b) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” will be deemed to refer\nto such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context\nwill require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank will remain a party\nhereto and will continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect\nto Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement but will not be required to issue additional Letters of\nCredit.\n(11) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, (a) in the case of an Event of Default\ndescribed in Section 8.01(8) or (9), on the Business Day, or (b) in the case of any other Event of Default, on the third\nBusiness Day, in each case, following the date on which the Borrowers receive notice from the Administrative Agent\ndemanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph (11), the Borrowers will deposit in an account\nwith or at the direction of the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of\nthe Revolving Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and\nunpaid interest thereon; provided that, in each case, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in\nSection 8.01(8) or (9), the obligation to deposit such cash collateral will become effective immediately, and such\ndeposit will become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind. Each such deposit\npursuant to this paragraph will be held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as collateral for the\npayment and performance of the obligations of the applicable Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative\nAgent will have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such accounts.\nOther than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments will be made at the option and\nsole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent and (ii) at any other\ntime, the Borrowers, in each case, in Cash Equivalents and at the risk and expense of the Borrowers, such deposits\nwill not bear interest. Moneys in such account described in the foregoing will be applied by the Administrative\nAgent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed\nand, to the extent not so applied, will be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers\nfor the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the\nconsent of the Required Lenders), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If\nthe Borrowers (or\n80\nany of them) are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event\nof Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) will be returned to such Borrowers within three (3)\nBusiness Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.\n(12) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Borrowers may, by notice to the Administrative Agent, designate\nany Lender (in addition to Wells Fargo) to act as an Issuing Bank; provided that such Lender agrees in its sole\ndiscretion to act as such and such Lender is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as an Issuing Bank.\nEach such additional Issuing Bank will execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the\nAdministrative Agent (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld) and will thereafter be an Issuing Bank\nhereunder for all purposes. The Borrowers may, in their sole discretion, request a Letter of Credit issuance from any\nIssuing Bank.\n(13) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank will (x) provide to the\nAdministrative Agent copies of any notice received from the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.05(2) no later than the\nnext Business Day after receipt thereof and (y) report in writing to the Administrative Agent as follows:\n(a) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of\nCredit, the date of such issuance, amendment or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of\nCredit to be issued, amended or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance,\namendment or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), and the Issuing Bank will be\npermitted to issue, amend or extend such Letter of Credit if the Administrative Agent will not have advised\nthe Issuing Bank that such issuance, amendment or extension would not be in conformity with the\nrequirements of this Agreement;\n(i) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, the date of such\nL/C Disbursement and the amount of such L/C Disbursement; and\n(ii) on any other Business Day, such other information with respect to the outstanding Letters of Credit\nissued by such Issuing Bank as the Administrative Agent reasonably requests, including but not\nlimited to prompt verification of such information as may be requested by the Administrative Agent.\nThe failure of any Issuing Bank (other than the Administrative Agent or any affiliate thereof acting as an Issuing\nBank) to comply with the provisions of sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (13) with respect to any letter of credit\nwill result in such letter of credit not being deemed a “Letter of Credit” hereunder and under the other Loan\nDocuments.\n(14) Reallocation. If the Maturity Date in respect of any tranche of a Class of Revolving Facility Commitments occurs\nprior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit issued under such Class of Revolving Facility Commitments, then (i) if\none or more other tranches of Revolving Facility Commitments of the same Class in respect of which the Maturity\nDate shall not have occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been\nissued (including for purposes of the obligations of the applicable Revolving Lenders to purchase participations\ntherein and to make Revolving Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.05(5)) under (and ratably\nparticipated in by the applicable Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Facility Commitments of the same Class in\nrespect of such non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of\nthe unutilized Revolving Facility\n81\nCommitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be\nreallocated); provided, in no event shall such reallocation cause a Lender’s share of the Revolving Facility\nCommitments of such Class to exceed such Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class, and (ii) to the\nextent not reallocated pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i), the applicable Borrowers shall cash\ncollateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.05(11). If, for any reason, such cash collateral is\nnot provided or reallocation does not occur, the Revolving Lenders under the maturing tranche shall continue to be\nresponsible for their participating interests in the applicable Letters of Credit. Except to the extent of reallocations of\nparticipations pursuant to clause (i) of the second preceding sentence, the occurrence of a Maturity Date with respect\nto a given tranche of Revolving Facility Commitments of the same Class shall have no effect upon (and shall not\ndiminish) the percentage participations of the Revolving Lenders in any Letter of Credit issued under such Class of\nRevolving Facility Commitments before such Maturity Date. Commencing with the Maturity Date of any tranche of\nRevolving Facility Commitments of the same Class, the sublimit for Letters of Credit shall be agreed with the\nLenders under the extended tranches.\n(15) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Issuing Bank (and its branches, Affiliates, and\ncorrespondents) and each such Person’s respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents (each,\nincluding Issuing Bank, a “Letter of Credit Related Person”) (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against\nany and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and\ndamages, and all reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and\nexpenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the enforcement of this indemnification (as\nand when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), which may be incurred by or awarded against\nany Letter of Credit Related Person (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.17) (the “Letter of\nCredit Indemnified Costs”), and which arise out of or in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement, any Letter\nof Credit, any issuer or drawing document referred to in or related to any Letter of Credit, or any action or proceeding\narising out of any of the foregoing (whether administrative, judicial or in connection with arbitration); in each case,\nincluding that resulting from the Letter of Credit Related Person’s own negligence; provided, that such indemnity\nshall not be available to any Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnification to the extent that such Letter of\nCredit Indemnified Costs may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent\njurisdiction to have resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Related\nPerson claiming indemnity. This indemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all\nLetters of Credit.\n(16) If the Borrowers request the issuance of Trade Letters of Credit, at Borrowers’ costs and expense, Borrowers shall\nexecute and deliver to Issuing Bank such additional certificates, instruments and/or documents and take such\nadditional action as may be reasonably requested by Issuing Bank to enable Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of\nCredit pursuant to this Agreement and related issuer document, to protect, exercise and/or enforce Issuing Banks’\nrights and interests under this Agreement or to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any issuer\ndocument.\nSECTION 2.06 Funding of Borrowings.\n(1) Each Lender will make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of\nimmediately available funds by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most\nrecently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that same-day ABR Loans will be made\nby each Lender on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., New York\nCity time; provided, further that Swingline Loans will be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative\nAgent will\n82\nmake such Loans available to the applicable Borrowers by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds,\nto an account of such Borrowers as specified in the applicable SOFR Loan Notice; provided that ABR Revolving\nLoans and Swingline Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement and reimbursements as\nprovided in Section 2.05(5) will be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.\n(2) Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that\nsuch Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the\nAdministrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with\nparagraph (1) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable\nBorrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable\nBorrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrowers severally\nagree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with\ninterest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrowers\nto but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent at (a) in the case of such Lender, the greater of\n(i) the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking\nindustry rules on interbank compensation or (b) in the case of Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans at\nsuch time. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent then such amount will constitute such\nLender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.\n(3) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may from its own funds make the\napplicable Loan on behalf of any such Lender, (including by means of Swingline Loans to the applicable Borrowers).\nIn such event, the Lender, on behalf of whom Administrative Agent made the Loan, will reimburse the\nAdministrative Agent for all or any portion of such Loan made on its behalf upon written notice given to such Lender\nnot later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day such reimbursement is requested. On each such\nsettlement date, the Administrative Agent will pay to each Lender the net amount owing to such Lender in connection\nwith such settlement, including amounts relating to Loans, fees, interest and other amounts payable hereunder. The\nentire amount of interest attributable to such Loan for the period from and including the date on which such Loan is\nmade on such Lender’s behalf, to but excluding the date the Administrative Agent is reimbursed in respect of such\nLoan by such Lender, will be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.\nSECTION 2.07 [Reserved].\nSECTION 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.\n(1) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments will terminate on the Maturity Date.\n(2) The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, any Class of the Revolving Facility\nCommitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments will be in an amount that is\nan integral multiple of $1.0 million and not less than $5.0 million (or, if less, the remaining amount of the applicable\nRevolving Facility Commitments) and (ii) the Borrowers will not terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility\nCommitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with\nSection 2.11, the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure would exceed the Line Cap.\n83\n(3) The Borrowers will notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Class of the Revolving\nFacility Commitments under paragraph (2) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to the date of such\ntermination or reduction, specifying such election and the date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the\nAdministrative Agent will advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by Borrowers pursuant\nto this Section 2.08 will be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Facility Commitments\ndelivered by Borrowers may state that such notice is revocable or conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit\nfacilities, in which case such notice may be revoked or extended by Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent\non or prior to the specified closing date). Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments will\nbe permanent. Each reduction of any Class of the Revolving Facility Commitments will be made ratably among the\nLenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class.\nSECTION 2.09 Promise to Pay; Evidence of Debt.\n(1) On the Maturity Date, each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (a) to the Administrative Agent for the\naccount of each Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan, Protective Advance or\nOveradvance made to any of the Borrowers on the Maturity Date, and (b) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid\nprincipal amount of each Swingline Loan on the Maturity Date.\n(2) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note (as each may be amended,\nsupplemented or modified from time to time, a “Note”). In such event, the applicable Borrowers will prepare,\nexecute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender\nand its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to\nBorrowers. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon at all times (including after\nassignment pursuant to Section 10.04) will be represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the payee\nnamed therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its registered assigns).\n(3) The Administrative Agent will maintain accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Loan to the\napplicable Borrowers made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (b) the\namount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the applicable Borrowers to\neach Lender hereunder and (c) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the\nLenders and each Lender’s share thereof. The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to this paragraph (3)\nwill be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the\nfailure of the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein will not in any manner affect the\nobligations of the applicable Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nSECTION 2.10 Optional Repayment of Loans.\n(1) The Borrowers will have the right at any time and from time to time to repay any Loan in whole or in part, without\npremium or penalty (but subject to Section 2.16), in an aggregate principal amount, (a) in the case of SOFR Loans,\nthat is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1.0 million, and (b) in the case of ABR Loans, that is an\nintegral multiple of $10,000 and not less than $100,000, or, in each case, if less, the amount outstanding.\n(2) Prior to any repayment of any Loans, the Borrowers will select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and will\nnotify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery,\n84\nfacsimile transmission or e-mail) of such selection not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, (a) in the case of an\nABR Borrowing, one Business Day before the anticipated date of such repayment and (b) in the case of a SOFR\nBorrowing, three Business Days before the anticipated date of such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing will\nbe applied to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing such that each Lender receives its ratable share of such\nrepayment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, prior to any repayment\nof a Swingline Loan hereunder, the applicable Borrowers will select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and\nwill notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery, facsimile transmission or e-mail) of\nsuch selection not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the scheduled date of such repayment. Repayments\nof SOFR Borrowings will be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid, together with any amounts due\nunder Section 2.16.\nSECTION 2.11 Mandatory Repayment of Loans.\n(1) In the event the aggregate amount of the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeds the Line Cap at such time, then\nthe applicable Borrowers will on such Business Day repay outstanding Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, and,\nif there remains an excess after paying all Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, cash collateralize Letters of Credit\n(in accordance with Section 2.05(11)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.\n(2) In the event and on such occasion as the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the\nBorrowers will deposit cash collateral (in accordance with Section 2.05(11)) in an amount equal to such excess.\n(3) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Period, all amounts in the Dominion Account\nshall be applied by the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (b) of the proviso to Section 5.11.\n(4) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Period, the Borrowers will prepay Revolving\nLoans (with no reduction in commitments) and cash collateralize Letters of Credit at 103% of the face amount\nthereof. Any amounts prepaid pursuant to this clause (4) will be applied pursuant to the waterfall set forth in\nSection 2.18(3); provided that amounts applied pursuant to subclauses (iv) and (vii) of clause (a) thereof and\nsubclause (iv) of clause (b) thereof will be applied:\n(a) first, to ABR Loans; and\n(b) second, to SOFR Loans.\nSECTION 2.12 Fees.\n(1) The Borrower Representative agrees to pay to each Revolving Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through\nthe Administrative Agent, on the first day after the end of each calendar quarter of the Borrowers in each fiscal year,\ncommencing with the first day after the end of the first full calendar quarter of Borrowers ending after the Closing\nDate, and on each Maturity Date and any date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders are\nterminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a “Commitment Fee”) on the daily amount of the Available\nUnused Commitment of such Lender during the preceding calendar quarter (or in the case of the first full calendar\nquarter, the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending with the end of the first full calendar quarter, or\nending with the date on which the last of the Revolving Facility\n85\nCommitments of such Lender will be terminated, as applicable) at a rate equal to the Commitment Fee Percentage.\nAll Commitment Fees will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. For\nthe purpose of calculating any Lender’s Commitment Fee, the outstanding Swingline Loans during the period for\nwhich such Lender’s Commitment Fee is calculated will be deemed to be zero. The Commitment Fee due to each\nLender will commence to accrue on the Closing Date and will cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the\nCommitments of such Lender will be terminated as provided herein.\n(2) The Borrower Representative agrees to pay to:\n(a) the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment\n(other than any Defaulting Lender, it being understood that at any time the Issuing Bank has Fronting\nExposure to such Defaulting Lender, the L/C Participation Fee with respect to such Fronting Exposure will\nbe payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account), on the first Business Day after the end of each calendar\nquarter of the Borrowers in each fiscal year, commencing with the first day after the end of the first full\ncalendar quarter of the Borrowers ending after the Closing Date, and on each Maturity Date and any date on\nwhich the Commitments of all the Lenders are terminated as provided herein, a fee (an “L/C Participation\nFee”) on such Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure\n(excluding the portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), during the preceding fiscal\ncalendar (or in the case of the first full calendar quarter, the period commencing on the Closing Date and\nending with the end of the first full calendar quarter, or ending with the Maturity Date or the date on which\nthe Commitments are terminated, as applicable) at a rate equal to, (i) in the case of Standby Letters of Credit,\nthe Applicable Margin for SOFR Revolving Loans, and (ii) in the case of Trade Letters of Credit, the\nApplicable Margin for SOFR Revolving Loans minus 0.50%; and\n(b) each Issuing Bank, for its own account (i) on the first Business Day after the end of each calendar quarter of\nthe Borrowers in each fiscal year, commencing with the first Business Day after the end of the first full\ncalendar quarter of the Borrowers ending after the Closing Date, and on each Maturity Date and any date on\nwhich the Commitments of all the Lenders are terminated as provided herein, a fronting fee in respect of\neach Letter of Credit issued by, or the term of which is extended by, such Issuing Bank for the period from\nand including the date of issuance or extension of such Letter of Credit to and including the termination of\nsuch Letter of Credit, computed at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily stated amount of such\nLetter of Credit plus (ii) such Issuing Bank’s customary issuance fees and customary documentary and\nprocessing fees and charges (collectively, “Issuing Bank Fees”). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing\nBank Fees that are payable on a per annum basis will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days\nelapsed in a year of 360 days.\n(3) The Borrower Representative agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the agency fees set forth\nin the Fee Letter at the times specified therein or in such other amounts and at such other times as may be separately\nagreed in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers from time to time (the “Administrative Agent\nFees”).\n(4) All Fees will be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent at the Payment\nOffice for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees will be paid directly\nto the applicable Issuing Banks.

A certificate as to the amount of such\npayment or liability delivered to such Loan Party by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on\nbehalf of a Lender, will be conclusive absent manifest error.\n(4) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority\npursuant to this Section 2.17, such Loan Party will deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy\nof a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such\npayment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.\n(5)\n(a) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments\nmade under any Loan Document will deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or\ntimes reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and\nexecuted documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit\nsuch payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.

This Section 2.17(8) will not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any\nLender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems, in good faith,\nto be confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other Person.\n(7) Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 will survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative\nAgent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the\nrepayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.\n(8) For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA and the term “Lender” includes any\nIssuing Bank.\nSECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.\n(1) Unless otherwise specified, (a) the applicable Borrowers will make each payment required to be made by them\nhereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of L/C Disbursements or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m.,\nNew York City time, at the Payment Office, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or\nthe Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17\nand 10.05 will be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto; and (b) each such payment will be made, on the date\nwhen due, in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any defense, recoupment, set-off or\ncounterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent,\nbe deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.\nThe Administrative Agent will distribute any such\n92\npayments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt\nthereof and will make settlements with the Lenders with respect to other payments at the times and in the manner\nprovided in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment hereunder is due on a day that is\nnot a Business Day, the date for payment will be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of\nany payment accruing interest, interest thereon will be payable for the period of such extension. Any payment\nrequired to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder will be deemed to have been made by the time required if\nthe Administrative Agent, at or before such time, has taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance\nwith the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to\nmake such payment.\n(2) The amount of each Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of outstanding Revolving Loans (including outstanding\nSwingline Loans) will be computed weekly (or more frequently in the Administrative Agent’s discretion) and will be\nadjusted upward or downward based on all Revolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) and repayments of\nRevolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) received by the Administrative Agent as of 4:00 p.m., New York City\ntime, on the first Business Day (such date, the “Settlement Date”) following the end of the period specified by the\nAdministrative Agent.

If the summary statement requires transfers to be made to the\nAdministrative Agent by the Lenders and is received prior to 2:00 p.m. on a Business Day, such transfers will be\nmade in immediately available funds no later than 5:00 p.m. that day and, if received after 2:00 p.m. then no later\nthan 4:00 p.m. on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable,\nunconditional and without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. If and to the extent any Lender has\nnot so made its transfer to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,\nforthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such\namount is paid to the Administrative Agent, equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by\nthe Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation plus any\nadministrative, processing, or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the\nforegoing.\n(3) Waterfalls.\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if (x) at any time insufficient funds are received by and\navailable to the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed\nL/C Disbursements, interest and fees and other Obligations then due from the Borrowers hereunder or (y) at\nany time during a Cash Dominion Period (including in connection with any termination of the Commitments\npursuant to Section 8.01) and the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent receives proceeds of\nCollateral pledged by the Loan Parties, such funds will be applied,\n(i) first, toward payment of any expenses, fees and indemnities due to the Agents hereunder;\n93\n(ii) second, toward payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrowers hereunder with respect to\nany Revolving Facility Credit Exposure, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance\nwith the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties;\n(iii) third, toward payment of principal of Swingline Loans, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, Protective\nAdvances and Overadvances then due from the Borrowers hereunder, ratably among the parties\nentitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements,\nProtective Advances and Overadvances then due to such parties;\n(iv) fourth, on a pro rata basis, (x) toward payment of other principal then due from the Borrowers\nhereunder with respect to any Revolving Facility Credit Exposure, ratably among the parties entitled\nthereto in accordance with the amounts of such principal then due to such parties, (y) toward the\npayment of any outstanding obligations owed to the Qualified Counterparties under any Designated\nHedging Agreements in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Designated Hedging Reserve ratably\namong the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of obligations under such\nDesignated Hedging Agreements then due to such parties and (z) toward payment of any outstanding\nobligations owed to Cash Management Banks under any Cash Management Obligations in an\naggregate amount not to exceed the Designated Cash Management Reserve ratably among the parties\nentitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of such Cash Management Obligations then due to\nsuch parties;\n(v) fifth, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit\nissued for the account of the Borrowers or any other Subsidiary in accordance with Section 2.05(11);\n(vi) sixth, to pay any other Obligations (excluding Obligations as described in items (2) and (3) of the\ndefinition of “Obligations” contained herein) ratably among the parties thereto in accordance with\nsuch amounts so owed them;\n(vii) seventh, to payment of obligations pursuant to Specified Hedge Agreements then due from the\nBorrowers or any other Subsidiary party to such Specified Hedge Agreements, ratably among the\nparties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of obligations under such Specified Hedge\nAgreements then due to such parties;\n(viii) eighth, to payment of Cash Management Obligations then due from the Borrowers or any other\nSubsidiary, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of such Cash\nManagement Obligations then due to such parties;

provided that (a) if any such\nparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations\nwill be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (b) the\nprovisions of this paragraph (4) will not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to\nand in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the\nexistence of a Defaulting Lender or Disqualified Institution) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration\nfor the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements\nto any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the\nprovisions of this paragraph (4) apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agree, to the extent it may\neffectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing\narrangements may exercise against any Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation\nas fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.\n(5) Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is\ndue to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder that the\napplicable Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable\nBorrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,\ndistribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if the\napplicable Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank,\nas applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to\nsuch Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is\ndistributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds\nRate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation.\n(6) If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(3), 2.05(4) or (5),\n2.06(1), or 2.18(4) then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision\nhereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy\nsuch Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.\nSECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.\n(1) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes\nor additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to\nSection 2.17, then such Lender will use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or\nbooking its Loans hereunder or assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or\nAffiliates if, in the reasonable\n95\njudgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to\nSection 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (b) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed\ncost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. Each Borrower\nhereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such\ndesignation or assignment.\n(2) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Borrower is required to\npay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any\nLender pursuant to Section 2.17, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender\nand the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and\nsubject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to\nan assignee that assumes such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such\nassignment); provided that (a) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative\nAgent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, to the extent\nthe consent of such Person would be required under Section 10.04 for an assignment of Loans to such assignee,\n(b) such Lender has received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded\nparticipations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other\namounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest\nand fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting\nfrom a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such\nassignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. Nothing in this Section 2.19 will\nbe deemed to prejudice any rights that any Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.\n(3) If any Lender (such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver,\ndischarge or termination which, pursuant to the terms of Section 10.08, requires the consent of such Lender with\nrespect to which the Required Lenders have granted their consent, then each Borrower will have the right (unless\nsuch Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) at its sole expense, to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by\ndeeming such Non-Consenting Lender to have assigned its Loans and its Commitments hereunder to one or more\nassignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank to the extent\nthe consent of such Person would be required under Section 10.04; provided that (a) all Obligations of the Borrowers\nowing to such Non-Consenting Lender (including accrued Fees and any amounts due under Section 2.15, 2.16\nor 2.17) being removed or replaced will be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such\nassignment and (b) the replacement Lender will purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a\nprice equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No action by or consent of the\nNon-Consenting Lender will be necessary in connection with such removal or assignment, which will be\nimmediately and automatically effective upon payment of such purchase price. In connection with any such\nassignment, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender will\notherwise comply with Section 10.04; provided that if such Non-Consenting Lender does not comply with\nSection 10.04 within three Business Days after the Borrowers’ request therefor, compliance with Section 10.04 will\nnot be required to effect such assignment.\nSECTION 2.20 Illegality; Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.\n96\n(1) Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any change in law has made it unlawful, or if any Governmental\nAuthority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to\nmake or maintain any SOFR Loans, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the\nAdministrative Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR\nBorrowings to SOFR Borrowings will be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the\nBorrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the\nBorrowers will upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), either convert all SOFR\nBorrowings of such Lender to ABR Borrowings, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender\nmay lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Borrowings to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not\nlawfully continue to maintain such Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers will also pay\naccrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.\n(2) Inability to Determine Rates.\n(A) General. Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.20(2)(b), if the Required Lenders determine\nthat for any reason in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that Adjusted\nTerm SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, then the\nAdministrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower Representative and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the\nLenders to make any SOFR Loan, and any right of any Borrower to convert any Loan or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan,\nshall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent\nrevokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower Representative may revoke any pending request for a\nBorrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request\ninto a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount specified therein, and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans\nwill be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such\nconversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted.\n(B) Benchmark Replacement Setting.\n(i) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the\noccurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative may amend\nthis Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with\nrespect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the\nAdministrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower Representative\nso long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment\nfrom the Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark\nReplacement pursuant to this Section 2.20(2)(b) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.\n(ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or\nimplementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming\nChanges from time to time (in consultation with the Borrower Representative) and, notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will\nbecome effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan\nDocument.\n97\n(iii)Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower\nRepresentative and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness\nof any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark\nReplacement. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower Representative of (x) the removal or reinstatement\nof any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.20(2)(b)(iv) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark\nUnavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if\napplicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.20(2)(b), including any determination with\nrespect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and\nany decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent\nmanifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this\nAgreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.20(2)\n(b).\n(iv)Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan\nDocument, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the\nthen-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (1) any tenor for such\nBenchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as\nselected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator\nof such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such\nBenchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest\nPeriod” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such\nunavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is\nsubsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or\n(2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark\n(including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period”\n(or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously\nremoved tenor.\n(v) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon Borrower Representative’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a\nBenchmark Unavailability Period, (1) the Borrower Representative may revoke any pending request for a borrowing\nof, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark\nUnavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower Representative will be deemed to have converted any such\nrequest into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans, and (2) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans\nwill be deemed to have been converted to ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any\nBenchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available\nTenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such\nBenchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.\nSECTION 2.21 Incremental Revolving Facility Increases.\n(1) Notice. At any time and from time to time after the Third Amendment Effective Date, on one or more occasions,\nsubject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may, by notice to the Administrative Agent,\nincrease the Revolving Facility Commitments (each such increase, an “Incremental Revolving Facility Increase”\nand such additional Revolving Facility Commitments, the “Incremental Commitments”).\n98\n(2) Ranking. Any Incremental Commitments will (a) rank pari passu in right of payment with the Obligations and (b) be\nsecured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Obligations.\n(3) Size. The principal amount of all commitments in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Increases received\npursuant to this Section 2.21, in the aggregate for all Incremental Revolving Facility Increases, shall not exceed\n$200.0 million.\n(4) Minimum Amounts. Each Incremental Revolving Facility Increase received pursuant to this Section 2.21 will be in\nan integral multiple of $1.0 million and in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (or such lesser\nminimum amount approved by the Administrative Agent).\n(5) Incremental Lenders. Incremental Revolving Facility Increases may be provided by any existing Lender (it being\nunderstood that no existing Lender will have an obligation to provide any Incremental Revolving Facility Increase),\nor any Additional Lender (collectively, the “Incremental Lenders”); provided that the Administrative Agent, each\nSwingline Lender and each Issuing Bank shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,\ndelayed or conditioned) to any Additional Lender’s provision of such Incremental Revolving Facility Increase if such\nconsent by the Administrative Agent or such Swingline Lender would be required under Section 10.04 for an\nassignment of Commitments or Loans to such Additional Lender.\n(6) Incremental Facility Amendments.\n(a) Each Incremental Revolving Facility Increase will become effective pursuant to an amendment (each, an\n“Incremental Facility Amendment”) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents,\nexecuted by the Borrowers, the applicable Incremental Lenders and the Administrative Agent. The\nAdministrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Facility\nAmendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental\nFacility Amendment, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable, will be deemed amended\nto the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental\nRevolving Facility Increase evidenced thereby.\n(b) Upon each Incremental Revolving Facility Increase of the Revolving Facility Commitments in accordance\nwith this Section 2.21:\n(i) each Incremental Lender in respect of such increase will automatically and without further act be\ndeemed to have assumed a portion of each Revolving Lender’s participations hereunder in\noutstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans such that, after giving effect to each such deemed\nassignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding\n(A) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (B) participations hereunder in Swingline Loans\nheld by each Lender (including each such Incremental Lender) will equal the percentage of the\naggregate Revolving Facility Commitments of all Lenders represented by such Lender’s Revolving\nFacility Commitment; and\n(ii) the Administrative Agent may, in consultation with the Borrowers, take any and all actions as may be\nreasonably necessary to ensure that, after giving effect to such Lender’s Incremental Commitments,\nthe percentage of the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitments held by each Lender (including\neach such Incremental Lender) will equal the percentage of the aggregate Revolving Facility\n99\nCommitments of all Lenders represented by such Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment, which\nmay be accomplished, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent following consultation with the\nBorrowers, by:\n(A) requiring the outstanding Revolving Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of a new\nBorrowing;\n(B) causing non-increasing Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding Revolving\nLoans to Incremental Lenders; or\n(C) a combination of the foregoing.\n(7) Conditions. The initial availability of any Incremental Revolving Facility Increase will be subject solely to the\nfollowing conditions:\n(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would exist immediately after giving\neffect to such Incremental Revolving Facility Increase on the date such Incremental Revolving Facility\nIncrease is incurred (or commitments in respect thereof are provided); provided, that if the Incremental\nRevolving Facility Increase is being incurred in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, (i) the date\nof determination of such condition shall be the LCA Test Date and (ii) on the date such Incremental\nRevolving Facility Increase is incurred (or commitments in respect thereof are provided), no Specified Event\nof Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would exist immediately after giving effect thereto;\n(b) the representations and warranties in the Loan Documents will be true and correct in all material respects\n(except for representations and warranties that are already qualified by materiality, which representations and\nwarranties will be accurate in all respects) immediately prior to, and immediately after giving effect to, the\nincurrence of such Incremental Revolving Facility Increase (or the date on which commitments in respect\nthereof are provided); provided, that if the Incremental Revolving Facility Increase is being incurred in\nconnection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, (i) the date of determination of such condition shall be the\nLCA Test Date and (ii) on the date of incurrence of such Incremental Revolving Facility Increase (or the date\non which commitments in respect thereof are provided), the only representations and warranties that will be\nrequired to be true and correct in all material respects shall be the Specified Representations; and\n(c) such other conditions (if any) as may be required by the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental\nRevolving Facility Increase, unless such other conditions are waived by such Incremental Lenders.\n(8) Terms. Any Incremental Revolving Facility Increase will be on terms identical to (and shall form part of) the\nRevolving Facility Commitments, except with respect to any arrangement, upfront, structuring or similar fees that\nmay be agreed to by and among the Borrowers and the Incremental Lenders.\nSECTION 2.22 Extensions of Revolving Facility Commitments.\n(1) Extension Offers. Pursuant to one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the\nBorrowers to all Lenders of Loans with a like Maturity Date, the Borrowers may extend the Maturity Date of each\nsuch Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitments and, subject to Section\n100\n2.22(3)(b), otherwise modify the terms of such Revolving Facility Commitments pursuant to the terms of the relevant\nExtension Offer, including by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect to such Revolving Facility\nCommitments (each, an “Extension,” and each group of Revolving Facility Commitments so extended, as well as the\noriginal Revolving Facility Commitments not so extended, being a “tranche”). Each Extension Offer will specify\nthe minimum amount of Revolving Facility Commitments with respect to which an Extension Offer may be\naccepted, which will be an integral multiple of $1.0 million and an aggregate principal amount that is not less than\n$25.0 million (or (a) if less, the aggregate principal amount of such Revolving Facility Commitments or (b) such\nlesser minimum amount as is approved by the Administrative Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,\nconditioned or delayed), and shall be offered on a pro rata basis to all Lenders having Revolving Facility\nCommitments with a like Maturity Date. If the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans and Revolving\nFacility Commitments (calculated on the face amount thereof) in respect of which Lenders have accepted an\nExtension Offer exceeds the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans and Revolving Facility Commitments\noffered to be extended pursuant to an Extension Offer, then the Loans and Revolving Facility Commitments of such\nLenders will be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the Revolving Facility Commitments of the\nLenders that have accepted such Extension Offer. There is no requirement that any Extension Offer or Extension\nAmendment (defined as follows) be subject to any “most favored nation” pricing provisions. Each Lender accepting\nan Extension Offer is referred to herein as an “Extending Lender,” and the Loans and Revolving Facility\nCommitment held by such Lender (and so extended) accepting an Extension Offer are referred to herein as\n“Extended Loans” and “Extended Commitments”.\n(2) Extension Amendments. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into\namendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (an “Extension Amendment”) with the Borrowers as\nmay be necessary in order to establish new tranches in respect of Extended Commitments (and related Extended\nLoans) and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the\nAdministrative Agent and the Borrowers in connection with the establishment of such new tranches, in each case, on\nterms consistent with this Section 2.22. This Section 2.22 supersedes any provisions in Section 10.08 to the contrary.\nExcept as otherwise set forth in an Extension Offer, there will be no conditions to the effectiveness of an Extension\nAmendment. Extensions will not constitute a voluntary or mandatory payment or prepayment for purposes of this\nAgreement.\n(3) Terms of Extension Offers and Extension Amendments. The terms of any Extended Commitments (and related\nExtended Loans) will be set forth in an Extension Offer and as agreed between the Borrowers and the Extending\nLenders accepting such Extension Offer; provided that:\n(a) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time the offering document in respect of an\nExtension Offer is delivered to the Lenders;\n(b) except as to pricing terms (interest rate and fees) and maturity, the terms and conditions of such Revolving\nFacility Credit Exposure are substantially identical to (including as to ranking and priority), or, taken as a\nwhole, no more favorable to the lenders or holders providing such Indebtedness than, those applicable to the\nRevolving Facility Commitments (and related Extended Loans) subject to such Extension Offer, as\ndetermined in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative.\n(4) Required Consents. No consent of any Lender or any other Person will be required to effectuate any Extension, other\nthan the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),\nthe Borrowers and each Lender agreeing to such\n101\nExtension with respect to one or more of its Revolving Facility Commitments. The transactions contemplated by this\nSection 2.22 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any\nExtended Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) will not require the\nconsent of any other Lender or any other Person, and the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including\nSections 2.09 and 2.16) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other\ntransaction contemplated by this Section 2.22 will not apply to any of the transactions effected pursuant to this\nSection 2.22.\nSECTION 2.23 Defaulting Lenders.\n(1) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a\nDefaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law:\n(a) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver\nor consent with respect to this Agreement is restricted as set forth in Section 10.08.\n(b) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the\nAdministrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at\nmaturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise), will be applied at such time or times as may be determined\nby the Administrative Agent as follows:\n(i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent\nhereunder;\n(ii) second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the\nIssuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder;\n(iii) third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank or Swingline\nLender, to be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender of any\nparticipation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit;\n(iv) fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the\nfunding of any Revolving Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its\nportion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;\n(v) fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest\nbearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund\nRevolving Loans under this Agreement;\n(vi) sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as\na result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing\nBank or Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s\nbreach of its obligations under this Agreement;\n102\n(vii) seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to\nthe Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the\nBorrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its\nobligations under this Agreement; and\n(viii) eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;\nprovided that if such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Disbursements in\nrespect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, such payment will be\napplied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata\nbasis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting\nLender. Any payments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to\npay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.23(1)(b) will\nbe deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.\n(c) Certain Fees. Such Defaulting Lender (i) will not be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee pursuant to\nSection 2.12(1) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers will not\nbe required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such\nDefaulting Lender) and (ii) will not be entitled to receive any L/C Participation Fee pursuant to\nSection 2.12(2) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (although the Borrowers will\nbe required to pay any such L/C Participation Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid\nto such Defaulting Lender to the non-Defaulting Lenders or Issuing Bank, in accordance with any\nreallocation of Fronting Exposure to non-Defaulting Lenders or as may be retained by the Issuing Bank, as\nthe case may be).\n(d) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a\nDefaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to\nacquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans pursuant to Sections 2.04\nand 2.05, the “Revolving Facility Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender will be computed without\ngiving effect to the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; provided, that, each such reallocation will be\ngiven effect only to the extent such that the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire,\nrefinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans will not exceed the positive\ndifference, if any, of (x) the Revolving Facility Commitment of such non-Defaulting Lender minus (y) the\naggregate outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender.\n(e) Elimination of Remaining Fronting Exposure. At any time that there exists a Defaulting Lender with a\nRevolving Facility Commitment, (i) immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing\nBank, the Borrowers will deliver to the Administrative Agent cash collateral in an amount sufficient to cover\nall Fronting Exposure of the Revolving L/C Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.23(1)(d)) which will\nbe held as security for the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers with respect to the Revolving L/C\nExposure and (ii) immediately upon request of the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, the\nBorrowers will repay an amount of Swingline Loans sufficient to eliminate the Fronting Exposure of the\nSwingline Lender.\n103\n(2) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank\nagree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting\nLender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in\nsuch notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash\ncollateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the\nother Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the\nRevolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a\npro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Facility Percentages (without giving effect to\nSection 2.23(1)(d)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will\nbe made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such\nLender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the\naffected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any\nclaim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.\nSECTION 2.24 Term SOFR Conforming Changes. In connection with the use or administration of\nTerm SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right (in consultation with the Borrower Representative) to make\nConforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document,\nany amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any\nother party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower\nRepresentative and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration\nof Term SOFR.\nARTICLE III\nRepresentations and Warranties\nEach Borrower with respect to itself, and each of the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Holdings, solely with\nrespect to Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.20, represent and warrant to each Agent and to each of the Lenders that:\nSECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers.

In addition, to the extent required under the laws of any jurisdiction\nother than the United States, each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby grants to the Administrative Agent\nany required powers of attorney to execute any Security Document governed by the laws of such jurisdiction on such\nLender’s or Issuing Bank’s behalf. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the\nAdministrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any\nfiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or\nliabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative\nAgent. The provisions of this Article IX (other than the Borrower Representative’s rights in the first, the second and\nthe fourth sentences of Section 9.09 and the last sentence of Section 9.01(2)) are solely for the benefit of the\nAdministrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrowers nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a\nthird party beneficiary of any of such provisions.\n(2) To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any\nLender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other\nGovernmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts\npaid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or\nwas not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in\ncircumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), or if the\nAdministrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement\nwithout deduction of applicable withholding Tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative\nAgent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including\nany penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-\npocket expenses) incurred. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all\namounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount\ndue the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.01(2). The agreements in this Section 9.01(2) shall survive the\nresignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a\nLender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, no Borrower shall have liability for the actions of the Administrative Agent pursuant to\nthe immediately preceding sentence.\n(3) In furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and the Swingline Lender (if applicable)\nand on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Hedge Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in\nsuch capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Hedge Agreements) hereby\nappoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring,\nholding and enforcing any and all Liens on the Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the\nObligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In connection therewith,\nthe Administrative Agent (and any Subagents appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.02 for\npurposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security\nDocuments, or for exercising any rights or remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent) shall be\nentitled to the benefits of this Article IX (including Section 9.07) as though the Administrative Agent (and any such\nSubagents) were an “Agent” under the Loan Documents, as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.\n155\n(4) Each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and the Swingline Lender (if applicable) and on behalf of itself and its\nAffiliates as potential counterparties to Hedge Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in such capacities and on behalf\nof itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Hedge Agreements) irrevocably authorizes the Administrative\nAgent, at its option and in its discretion:\n(a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan\nDocument:\n(i) upon termination of the Commitments, the payment in full of all Obligations (other than Obligations\nin respect of (i) Specified Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Obligations that are not then\ndue and payable and (ii) contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations that are not yet\ndue and payable and for which no claim has been asserted) and the expiration, termination or cash-\ncollateralization or backstopping (to the satisfaction of the respective Issuing Bank) of all Letters of\nCredit;\n(ii) that is disposed of or to be disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted\nhereunder or under any other Loan Document; or\n(iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 10.08 hereof;\n(b) to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a\nRestricted Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder; and\n(c) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan\nDocument to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(3) (and to the extent\nrequired by the terms thereof as of the Closing Date).\nUpon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the\nAdministrative Agent’s authority to release its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan\nParty from its obligations under the Loan Documents.\n(5) In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,\nadjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, (a) the Administrative Agent\n(irrespective of whether the principal of any Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by\ndeclaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the\nBorrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (i) to file and prove a\nclaim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any or all of the Obligations\nthat are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the\nclaims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Agents and any Subagents allowed in such judicial proceeding and\n(ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the\nsame, and (b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such\njudicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Bank to make such payments to the\nAdministrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the\nLenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation,\nexpenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts\ndue the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the\n156\nAdministrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Bank any plan\nof reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition (each, a “Plan of Reorganization”) affecting the\nObligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of\nthe claim of any Lender or Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.\n(6) The Lenders and each other holder of an Obligation under a Loan Document shall act collectively through the\nAdministrative Agent and, without limiting the delegation of authority to the Administrative Agent set forth herein\nand subject to the proviso to the final paragraph of Section 8.01, the Required Lenders shall direct the Administrative\nAgent with respect to the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and under other Loan Documents (including with\nrespect to alleging the existence or occurrence of, and exercising rights and remedies as a result of, any Default or\nEvent of Default in each case that could be waived with the consent of the Required Lenders), and such rights and\nremedies shall not be exercised other than through the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not\npreclude any Lender from exercising any right of set-off in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.06 or from\nexercising rights and remedies (other than the enforcement of Collateral) with respect to any payment default after\nthe occurrence of the Maturity Date with respect to any Loans made by it.\nSECTION 9.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under\nthis Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or\nany portion thereof)) by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other\nconsultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

Should any\ninstrument in writing from any Borrower or any other Loan Party be required by any Subagent so appointed by the\nAdministrative Agent to more fully or certainly vest in and confirm to such Subagent such rights, powers, privileges and\nduties, such Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments\npromptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. If any Subagent, or successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of\nacting, resign or be removed, all rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Subagent, to the extent permitted by law, shall\nautomatically vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Subagent. The\nAdministrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney-in-fact or Subagent\nthat it selects in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 in the absence of the Administrative Agent’s\ngross negligence or willful misconduct.\nSECTION 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. None of the Administrative Agent, its Affiliates or any of\ntheir respective officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact shall be (1) liable for any action lawfully taken or\nomitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to\nthe extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to\nhave resulted from its or such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (2) responsible in any manner to any\nof the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof\ncontained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to\nor provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for\nthe value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of\n157\nthis Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder\nor thereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations\nexcept those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to\nrely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,\ndocument or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) or\nconversation believed in good faith by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper\nPerson. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed in good\nfaith by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining\ncompliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a\nLender or any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or\nIssuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Bank\nprior to such Borrowing. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to Holdings or the\nBorrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken\nby it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and each Issuing\nBank, in each case in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by Holdings or the Borrowers and without limiting the\nobligation Holdings or the Borrowers to do so), in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its aggregate Revolving Facility\nCredit Exposure and, in the case of the indemnification of each Agent, unused Commitments hereunder; provided that the\naggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans owing to the Swingline Lender and of L/C Disbursements owing to any\nIssuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving\nFacility Credit Exposure) (determined at the time such indemnity is sought), from and against any and all liabilities,\n159\nobligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever\nthat may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the\nAdministrative Agent or such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of\nthe other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions\ncontemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank under or in\nconnection with any of the foregoing, regardless of whether such matter is initiated by any Lender, any Borrower, any of their\nAffiliates or any other Person; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,\nobligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final\nand non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agent’s or such\nIssuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Administrative Agent or\nany Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the\nLenders to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other\nLender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for its\nratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse the\nAdministrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender’s ratable share of such amount. The\nagreements in this Section 9.07 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.\nSECTION 9.08 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to,\naccept deposits from, and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though the Administrative Agent\nwere not the Administrative Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit\nissued, or Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under\nthis Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the\nAdministrative Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.\nSECTION 9.09 Successor Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent\nupon ten days’ notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers. Any such resignation by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall\nalso constitute its resignation as an Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender, in which case the resigning Administrative Agent\n(x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit or make any additional Swingline Loans hereunder and (y) shall\nmaintain all of its rights as Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, with respect to any Letters of Credit issued\nby it, or Swingline Loans made by it, prior to the date of such resignation. If the Administrative Agent resigns as the\nAdministrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from\namong the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless a Specified Event of Default shall\nhave occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative\nAgent, and the reference to the resigning Administrative Agent means such successor agent effective upon such appointment\nand approval, and the former Administrative Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any\nother or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any\nholders of the Loans. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such\nappointment within 10 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring\nAdministrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an\noffice in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as\nAdministrative Agent by the date that is ten days following a retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring\nAdministrative Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the retiring Administrative Agent\nhereunder shall, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank appoint a successor agent which shall (unless a Specified\nEvent of\n160\nDefault shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrowers (which approval shall not be\nunreasonably withheld or delayed). After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation as Administrative Agent, the\nprovisions of this Section 9.09 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was\nAdministrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.\nSECTION 9.10 Arrangers.

Subject to clause (5)(b) of this Section 10.04, the Borrowers agree that each\nParticipant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a\nLender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (2) of this Section 10.04, provided\nthat such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.19(2) as if it were an assignee\npursuant to paragraph (2) of this Section 10.04. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the\nBorrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the\nprovisions of Section 2.19(2) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each\nParticipant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06 as though it were a Lender; provided that\nsuch Participant shall be subject to Section 2.18(4) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a\nparticipation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a\nregister on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated\ninterest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the\n“Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of\nthe Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a\nParticipant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan\nDocument) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such\ncommitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the\nUnited States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent\nmanifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as\nthe owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no\nresponsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n(b) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the\napplicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such\nParticipant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior written\nconsent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 to the extent such Participant fails\nto comply with Section 2.17(5) or Section 2.17(6) as though it were a Lender.\n167\n(6) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this\nAgreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a\nFederal Reserve Bank and in the case of any Lender that is an Approved Fund, any pledge or assignment to any\nholders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee for, or any other\nrepresentative of, such holders, and this Section 10.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security\ninterest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its\nobligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n(7) Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender\nrequiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (6) of this Section 10.04.\n(8) If the Borrowers wish to replace the Loans or Commitments with ones having different terms (which would\notherwise have been permitted in accordance with Section 10.08(4) if made as new Loans or Commitments), it shall\nhave the option, with the consent of the Administrative Agent and, where relevant, the Swingline Lender and each\nIssuing Bank, and subject to at least three Business Days’ advance notice to the Lenders, instead of repaying the\nLoans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be replaced, to (i) require the Lenders to assign such Loans or\nCommitments to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) amend the terms thereof in accordance with\nSection 10.08 (with such replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 10.08(4)).\nPursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated\namong the Lenders in the same manner as would be required if such Loans were being optionally prepaid or such\nCommitments were being optionally reduced or terminated by the Borrowers), accompanied by payment of any\naccrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to Section 10.05(2). By receiving such purchase\nprice, the Lenders shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or Commitments pursuant to the terms\nof the form of Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A, and accordingly no other action by such\nLenders shall be required in connection therewith. The provisions of this paragraph (8) are intended to facilitate the\nmaintenance of the perfection and priority of existing security interests in the Collateral during any such replacement.\n(9)\n(a) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date\n(the “Trade Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a\nportion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower Representative\nhas consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person\nwill not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation). For the\navoidance of doubt, with respect to any Assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable\nTrade Date, (x) such Assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the\nexecution by the Borrower Representative of an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Assignee\nwill not by itself result in such Assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any\nassignment in violation of this clause (9)(a) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (9) shall\napply.\n(b) If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrower\nRepresentative’s prior written consent in violation of clause (a) above, or if any Person becomes a\nDisqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Borrower\n168\nRepresentative may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and\nthe Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all\nobligations of the Borrowers owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Commitment\nand/or (B) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to\nthe restrictions contained in this Section 10.04), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement\nto one or more Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such\nDisqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued\ninterest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions (A) will not\n(x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrowers, the\nAdministrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and\nthe Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential\ncommunications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B)\n(x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for\nthe purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain\nfrom taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Disqualified Institution will\nbe deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions\nconsented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any Plan of Reorganization, each Disqualified\nInstitution party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan of Reorganization, (2) if such Disqualified\nInstitution does vote on such Plan of Reorganization notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing\nclause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant to\nSection 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such\nvote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan of\nReorganization in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any\nother Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the\nBankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).\n(d) The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrowers hereby expressly authorize the\nAdministrative Agent, to provide the list of Disqualified Institutions to each Lender requesting the same;\nprovided that the Lenders shall not be restricted from participating their obligations under this Agreement\n(including all or a portion of their Commitments and the Loans owing to them) to Disqualified Institutions if\nthe Administrative Agent has not posted the list of Disqualified Institutions to the Platform.\nSECTION 10.05 Expenses;

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject\nto a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that\nmight otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against\nsuch Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be\nexercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were\ngoverned by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the\nforegoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting\nLender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any\nQFC Credit Support.\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n183\nExhibit 21\nSIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES OF\nULTA BEAUTY, INC.\nName of Subsidiary: Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Organization:\nUlta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc.

Settersten\nScott M. Settersten\nChief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary\nExhibit 97\nULTA BEAUTY, INC.\nSENIOR LEADERSHIP CLAWBACK POLICY\nUlta Beauty, Inc. (“Ulta Beauty”) maintains a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability. This policy\n(the “Policy”) allows Ulta Beauty to “clawback” or recover incentive compensation paid or payable to any\ncovered person under the circumstances described below.\nWho is Covered By This Policy?\nYou are covered by this Policy if you are:\n● An executive officer, who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (an “Executive Officer”);\n● An officer that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer;\n● An officer not reporting to the Chief Executive Officer with the title of Senior Vice President or Vice\nPresident\n● Non-officers who are recipients of an Ulta Beauty equity award; and otherwise selected by Ulta\nBeauty to be covered by this Policy and notified of such coverage.\nFor What Reasons Can Ulta Beauty Recover Compensation?\nUlta Beauty will be entitled to “clawback” or recover incentive compensation under this Policy in the following\nevents (each a “Recoverable Event”):\n● Ulta Beauty being required to prepare an accounting restatement due to its material noncompliance\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, whether or not there is any fraud\nor misconduct, and whether or not you were responsible (a “Restatement”). A Restatement does not\ninclude any changes to Ulta Beauty’s financial statements caused by the retrospective application of\na change in accounting principle, the retrospective revision to reportable segment information due a\nchange in the structure of Ulta Beauty’s internal organization, the retrospective reclassification due\nto a discontinued operation, the retrospective application of a change in reporting entity or\nretrospective revisions for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in\ncapital structure.\n● Your fraud or misconduct, regardless of whether the fraud or misconduct is related to a Restatement.\n● Your violation of Ulta Beauty’s Code of Business Conduct.\n● Your violation of any applicable non-compete, non-solicitation or confidentiality covenants by\nwhich you are bound (“Employee Covenants” or “CIPCA”).\nWhat Kinds of Compensation Can Be Recovered?\nUlta Beauty may recover the following types of incentive compensation:\n● Annual and long-term incentives that were paid or vested under any plan or agreement, whether paid\nor payable in cash and/or shares including any annual bonus, options, stock appreciation rights\n(SAR), restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance shares;\n● Outstanding incentive awards that have not been earned or vested;\n● Gains realized on the exercise of options, SARs or upon the vesting or settlement of other equity\nawards (e.g., restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance shares); and\n● Any other compensation that is (a) granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the\nattainment of a financial reporting measure, and (b) received by a person (1) after beginning service\nas an Executive Officer, (2) who served as an Executive Officer at an time during the performance\nperiod for such compensation, (3) while Ulta Beauty has a class of securities listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association, and (4) during the Covered Period (as\ndescribed below).\nBase salary is not subject to recovery under this Policy.\nHow Much Compensation Can Be Recovered?\nThe amount Ulta Beauty may recover under this Policy depends upon the Recoverable Event.\nRestatements\nIn the event of a Restatement, Ulta Beauty will recover reasonably promptly any excess of (1) the amount of\nany incentive compensation received during the Covered Period over (2) the amount of any such incentive-\nbased compensation that would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts,\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total\nshareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical\nrecalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement: (A) the amount must be based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return\nupon which the incentive-based compensation was received; and (B) Ulta Beauty must maintain documentation\nof the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the exchange or association.\nFraud, Misconduct and Other Recoverable Events\nIn the event of fraud, misconduct, violation of the Code of Business Conduct or violation of an Employee\nCovenant, Ulta Beauty may recover up to the sum of:\n● The amount of incentive compensation paid, granted, or vested during the Covered Period; and\n● The value of any equity award that vested or was exercised or settled during the Covered Period,\nincluding the gain on any equity awards if the shares have been sold.\n2\nWhat is the Covered Period?\nThe “Covered Period” is a look-back period during which your incentive compensation is at-risk for recovery\nunder this Policy. Incentive compensation received outside of the Covered Period is not subject to recovery\nunder this Policy. The Covered Period depends upon the Recoverable Event. If the Recoverable Event is:\n● Fraud, misconduct or a violation of the Code of Business Conduct, then the Covered Period will be\na period of 24 months prior to, or all periods from, the date of such fraud, misconduct or violation\noccurred, without limitation, whichever is greater;\n● The violation of an Employee Covenant, then the Covered Period is the period for which you would\nbe restricted by the Employee Covenant (e.g., if you are subject to a 1 year non-solicitation, then the\nCovered Period would be the 1 year following such violation); or\n● A Restatement, then the Covered Period is the 3 completed fiscal years immediately preceding the\ndate that Ulta Beauty is required to prepare the Restatement (and any transition period of less than 9\nmonths within or immediately following those 3 completed fiscal years). The date on which Ulta\nBeauty is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of (a) the date Ulta Beauty’s board\nof directors, a committee of the board or officers authorized to take such action (if board action is\nnot required) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that Ulta Beauty is required to\nprepare a Restatement or (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs Ulta\nBeauty to prepare a Restatement.\nFrom What Sources Can Compensation Be Recovered?\nUlta Beauty may recover the amounts described above (“recoverable amount”) as follows:\n● Requiring you to repay Ulta Beauty the recoverable amount in cash or shares;\n● Offsetting future incentive compensation payments by the recoverable amount;\n● Cancelling or forfeiting outstanding equity awards with a value equal to the recoverable amount;\n● Cancelling or forfeiting any annual bonus opportunities with a value equal to the recoverable\namount;\n● Reducing the amount of future annual cash or long-term equity awards by the value of the\nrecoverable amount; and\n● Requiring you to repay in cash to Ulta Beauty any gains realized on the exercise of options, SARs or\nupon the vesting or settlement of other equity awards.\nIf Ulta Beauty decides to recover against compensation that has already been paid and taxed, then the\nrecoverable amount will reflect the taxes already paid, and will only be determined on an after-tax basis;\nprovided that, to the extent a recovery results from a Restatement, then the recoverable amount will be\ndetermined without regard to taxes to the extent required for compliance with applicable Securities and\nExchange Commission regulations and applicable listing standards. In addition, if Ulta Beauty decides to\nrecover compensation by offsetting\n3\nincentive compensation that has not yet been paid or taxed, then the recoverable amount will be determined\nwithout regard to taxes.\nHow Will The Policy Be Enforced And Interpreted?\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) has the power to enforce the Policy\nand to make all determinations under the Policy in its sole discretion. In particular, the Committee will have the\npower to determine, based on the facts and circumstances:\n● If a Recoverable Event has occurred;\n● Whether recovery of incentive compensation is warranted or practical;\n● What incentive compensation should be recovered, based on the circumstances of the Recoverable\nEvent;\n● How much incentive compensation is to be recovered;\n● The method of recovery, including whether full or partial forfeiture and/or repayment of award(s) is\nto be required, taking into consideration the pre-tax and post-tax treatment; and\n● Whether additional remedies beyond those described in this Policy should be pursued.\nAll actions taken and decisions made by the Committee on all matters relating to this Policy will be in the\nCommittee’s sole and absolute discretion and will be conclusive and binding on all parties. The Committee\nmay apply the Policy differently to each covered person, in its discretion, taking into account (i) whether the\nassertion of a claim may violate applicable law or prejudice the interests of Ulta Beauty (including but not\nlimited to any prejudice to the interests of Ulta Beauty in any proceeding or investigation), (ii) whether other\npenalties or punishments are being imposed on the covered person, including by third parties, or any\ngovernmental or regulatory authority (including, without limitation action taken under Section 304 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), (iii) the nature of the events that led to the Recoverable Event, (iv) the covered\nperson’s conduct, role and responsibilities with respect to the events that led to a Recoverable Event, (v) the\nrequirements and definitions set forth in applicable stock exchange listing standards and regulatory guidance\nrelating thereto, and (vi) such other factors as may be determined by the Committee.\nAre There Exemptions to Enforcement of this Policy?\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, recovery of incentive compensation will not be required\nto the extent Ulta Beauty’s committee of independent directors responsible for executive compensation\ndecisions (or a majority of the independent directors on Ulta Beauty’s board of directors in the absence of such\na committee) has made a determination that such recovery would be impracticable and one of the following\nconditions have been satisfied:\n(a) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of\nerroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, Ulta Beauty must make a\nreasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable\nattempt(s) to recover, and provide that\n4\ndocumentation to the national securities exchange or association on which its securities are listed.\n(b) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022;\nprovided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously\nawarded compensation based on violation of home country law, Ulta Beauty must obtain an opinion of\nhome country counsel, acceptable to the national securities exchange or association on which its\nsecurities are listed, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the\nexchange or association.\n(c) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are\nbroadly available to employees of Ulta Beauty, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13)\nor 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nWhen is this Policy Effective?\nThis Policy is effective October 2, 2023.
