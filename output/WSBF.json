Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n\nCompany Release - 10/22/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWAUWATOSA, Wis., Oct. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income of $4.7 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $3.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net income per diluted share was $0.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.46 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n“The Community Banking segment achieved growth in its loan and core deposit (excluding brokered deposits) balances,” said William Bruss, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. “We continue to maintain strong asset quality metrics and remain in a net recovery position, resulting in a negative provision during the quarter. While the decrease in our wholesale borrowing rate during the quarter captures a portion of the benefit from the 50 bps cut in the Federal Funds rate during September, the competitive retail funding environment remains a headwind. The Mortgage Banking segment experienced a decrease in fundings; however, it remained profitable due in large part to our continued focus on cost control. Waterstone Financial, Inc. remained active in share repurchases and once again declared a dividend, as we are committed to shareholder returns.” \n\nHighlights of the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\n\n●| Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $4.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| Consolidated return on average assets was 0.83% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.58% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Consolidated return on average equity was 5.55% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and 3.63% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Dividends declared during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $0.15 per common share.  \n●| During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 71,000 shares at a cost (including the federal excise tax) of $979,000, or $13.75 per share.  \n●| Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.25% at September 30, 2024, 0.25% at June 30, 2024, and 0.20% at September 30, 2023.   \n●| Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.63% at September 30, 2024, 0.76% at June 30, 2024, and 0.53% at September 30, 2023.   \n●| Book value per share was $17.58 at September 30, 2024 and $16.94 at December 31, 2023.   \n  \nCommunity Banking Segment\n\n●| Pre-tax income totaled $5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which represents a $14,000, or 0.2%, decrease compared to $5.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| Net interest income totaled $12.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which represents a $181,000, or 1.5%, decrease compared to $12.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Average loans held for investment totaled $1.69 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which represents an increase of $60.9 million, or 3.7%, compared to $1.63 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in the construction, commercial real estate, and over four family mortgages. Average loans held for investment increased $19.7 million compared to $1.67 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in construction and over four family mortgages.  \n●| Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points to 2.13% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.26% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which was a result of an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points compared to 2.01% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in weighted average yield on loans receivable and held for sale.   \n●| Past due loans at the community banking segment totaled $8.0 million at September 30, 2024, $9.3 million at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million at September 30, 2023.  \n●| The segment had a negative provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $218,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $206,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The current quarter decrease was primarily due to a decrease in historical loss rates, net recoveries for the period, and improvements in certain internal asset quality metrics offset by an adjustment in the qualitative factors primarily related to increases in economic risks related to commercial real estate loans during the quarter. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was $84,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of $239,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to a decrease of loans that are currently waiting to be funded compared to the prior quarter end.   \n●| The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP ratio, was 60.35% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.43% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Average deposits (excluding escrow accounts) totaled $1.25 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $47.9 million, or 4.0%, compared to $1.20 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Average deposits increased $27.6 million, or 9.1% annualized, compared to $1.22 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increases were primarily due to an increase in certificates of deposit balances. The segment had $2.0 million in brokered certificate of deposits at September 30, 2024.  \n  \nMortgage Banking Segment\n\n●| Pre-tax income totaled $144,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.1 million of pre-tax loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| Loan originations decreased $38.8 million, or 6.5%, to $558.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $597.6 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 88.9% of originations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95.4% of total originations for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Mortgage banking non-interest income decreased $66,000, or 0.3%, to $21.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  \n●| Gross margin on loans sold totaled 3.83% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.   \n●| Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased $1.3 million, or 7.3%, to $15.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $17.2 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily related to decreased salary expense and incentives expense driven by reduced employee headcount and a decrease in new branches added over the past year.  \n  \n**About Waterstone Financial, Inc.**\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for WaterStone Bank.

Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\nCompany Release - 7/25/2024 4:01 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWAUWATOSA, Wis., July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income of $5.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to net income of $4.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Net income per diluted share was $0.47 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.30 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n“The results this quarter reflect our continued efforts over the past year to improve efficiencies at the Mortgage Banking segment,” said William Bruss, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. \"While our results have improved, we continue to face many challenges within the Mortgage Banking segment, as the mortgage banking industry continues to face unknown variables driven by consumer demand, affordable inventory, and interest rates. The Community Banking segment continues to deal with margin pressure, as short-term funding rates remain elevated due to the restrictive monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. Throughout this challenging period, we have maintained a robust share repurchase program that continues to return strong value to shareholders through repurchase activity that is accretive to book value.\" \n\nHighlights of the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\n\n●| Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $5.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $4.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| Consolidated return on average assets was 1.02% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.74% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n●| Consolidated return on average equity was 6.84% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 4.41% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n●| Dividends declared during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, totaled $0.15 per common share.  \n●| During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 481,000 shares at a cost (including the federal excise tax) of $5.8 million, or $11.99 per share. This share repurchase activity was accretive to book value per share in the amount of $0.13 during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.   \n●| Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.25% at June 30, 2024, 0.23% at March 31, 2024, and 0.19% at June 30, 2023.   \n●| Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.76% at June 30, 2024, 0.64% at March 31, 2024, and 0.50% at June 30, 2023.   \n●| Book value per share was $17.20 at June 30, 2024 and $16.94 at December 31, 2023.   \n  \nCommunity Banking Segment\n\n●| Pre-tax income totaled $5.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which represents a $1.3 million, or 20.5%, decrease compared to $6.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| Net interest income totaled $11.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which represents a $2.0 million, or 15.1%, decrease compared to $13.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n●| Average loans held for investment totaled $1.67 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which represents an increase of $81.6 million, or 5.1%, compared to $1.59 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in the construction and commercial real estate mortgages. Average loans held for investment increased $4.1 million compared to $1.66 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in construction and commercial real estate mortgages.  \n●| Net interest margin decreased 46 basis points to 2.01% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.47% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, which was a result of an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. Net interest margin decreased 14 basis points compared to 2.15% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, driven by an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the short-term borrowing rates increased resulted in increased funding rates.  \n●| Past due loans at the community banking segment totaled $9.3 million at June 30, 2024, $8.1 million at March 31, 2024, and $5.7 million at June 30, 2023.  \n●| The segment had a negative provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $197,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $619,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The current quarter decrease was primarily due to decrease to historical loss rates and improvements in certain internal asset quality metrics offset by an adjustment in the qualitative factors primarily related to increases in economic risks related to commercial real estate loans during the quarter. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was $82,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of $462,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was due primarily to a decrease of loans that are currently waiting to be funded compared to the prior quarter end.  \n●| The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP ratio, was 62.37% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 55.81% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.  \n●| Average deposits (excluding escrow accounts) totaled $1.22 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $35.7 million, or 3.0%, compared to $1.18 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024\n\nCompany Release - 4/30/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWAUWATOSA, Wis., April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income of $3.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to net income of $2.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The current year reflects a $0.04 per share one-time charge related to a change in Wisconsin state tax law, as described below.\n\n“We are pleased that the Mortgage Banking segment demonstrated improved performance, as volumes and margin have bounced off of the lows from the past two years,” said William Bruss, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. \"While our results of operations have improved form the prior year, the Mortgage Banking segment continues to face industry-wide headwinds in the form of low levels of housing inventory and affordability constraints driven by elevated mortgage rates. The Community Banking segment continues to contend with margin compression, driven by higher funding costs, as interest rates remain at recent high levels. In spite of the challenging environment, we continue to maintain strong asset quality and remained focused on returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases.\" \n\nHighlights of the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\n\n  * Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $3.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $2.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Consolidated return on average assets was 0.56% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to 0.43% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Consolidated return on average equity was 3.56% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and 2.35% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Dividends declared during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $0.15 per common share.\n  * During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 417,000 shares at a cost (including the federal excise tax) of $5.3 million, or $12.65 per share. This share repurchase activity was accretive to book value per share in the amount of $0.09 during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n  * Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.23% at March 31, 2024, 0.23% at December 31, 2023, and 0.22% at March 31, 2023.\n  * Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.64% at March 31, 2024, 0.68% at December 31, 2023, and 0.64% at March 31, 2023.\n  * Book value per share was $16.98 at March 31, 2024 and $16.94 at December 31, 2023.\n  * In July 2023, Wisconsin’s Governor signed the Wisconsin state budget, retroactive to January 1, 2023, which included legislation that provides financial institutions with an exemption from state taxable income for interest, fees, and penalties earned on loans to existing Wisconsin-based business or agriculture purpose loans that are $5.0 million or less in balance on January 1, 2023, and to new loans that meet the criteria. On March 18, 2024, the State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue issued an emergency ruling with additional details of the law. This publication enabled us to estimate the impact on our Wisconsin state income tax expense. The impact moving forward should result in no Wisconsin state income taxes being expensed, resulting in a lower estimated effective tax rate. The elimination of Wisconsin state income tax expense resulted in the establishment of a valuation allowance for Wisconsin state income deferred tax assets, resulting in a one-time $1.1 million charge to state income tax expense in the first quarter. Partially offsetting the impact of the charge related to the valuation allowance the Company realized a one-time benefit of approximately $368,000 during the quarter to recognize a reduction in current state income tax provision. The net amount of these two items resulted in a a $0.04 reduction of earnings per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\nCommunity Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax income totaled $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which represents a $2.2 million, or 33.5%, decrease compared to $6.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Net interest income totaled $11.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which represents a $2.4 million, or 17.2%, decrease compared to $14.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Average loans held for investment totaled $1.66 billion during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which represents an increase of $133.0 million, or 8.7%, compared to $1.53 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in the single-family, construction, and commercial real estate mortgages. Average loans held for investment increased $4.1 million compared to $1.66 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in construction mortgages.\n  * Net interest margin decreased 73 basis points to 2.15% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2.88% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which was a result of an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2.25% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, driven by an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates.\n  * Past due loans at the community banking segment totaled $8.1 million at March 31, 2024, $7.9 million at December 31, 2023, and $7.5 million at March 31, 2023.\n  * The segment had a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $35,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to a negative provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $96,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The current quarter increase was primarily due to adjustments in the qualitative factors related to increases in treasury interest rates during the quarter offset by a decrease to historical loss rates. The provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was $70,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of $484,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was due primarily to an increase of construction loans that are currently waiting to be funded compared to the prior quarter end.\n  * The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP ratio, was 65.17% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 54.53% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Average deposits (excluding escrow accounts) totaled $1.19 billion during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $16.5 million, or 1.4%, compared to $1.17 billion during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Average deposits decreased $19.0 million, or 6.3% annualized, compared to $1.21 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nMortgage Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax income totaled $369,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $3.7 million of pre-tax loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Loan originations increased $42.4 million, or 9.6%, to $485.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $442.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 93.0% of originations for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to 96.5% of total originations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Mortgage banking non-interest income increased $2.4 million, or 13.2%, to $20.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $18.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Gross margin on loans sold totaled 4.10% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 3.78% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n  * Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased $343,000, or 2.3%, to $14.8 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to $15.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease primarily related to decreased salary expense and health insurance expense driven by reduced employee headcount and lower claims to start the 2024 year.\n  * Total other noninterest expense decreased $1.8 million, or 74.4%, to $616,000 during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to $2.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease primarily related to decreased provision for branch losses, branch overhead, provision for loan sale losses, and reversal of mortgage servicing rights impairment.\n\n\n\n**About Waterstone Financial, Inc.**\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for WaterStone Bank.

Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2023\n\nCompany Release - 1/30/2024 4:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWAUWATOSA, Wis., Jan. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported a net loss of $40,000, or less than $0.01 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $935,000, or $0.04 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net income per diluted share was $0.46 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.89 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n\n“The current market dynamics continue to present challenges for both our Community Banking and Mortgage Banking segments,” said William Bruss, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. \"The rapid rise in short-term interest rates and an inverted yield curve continue to create downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Community Banking segment. In addition, the housing market continues to be adversely impacted by elevated interest rates, which have resulted in low levels of inventory and a decrease in housing affordability. As is the case for the overall mortgage banking industry, the results of operations within our Mortgage Banking segment have been negatively impacted by declining mortgage origination volumes and compressed margins. Despite these challenges, our strong asset quality and robust level of capital allowed us to continue to provide strong shareholder returns throughout 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we declared dividends of $0.70 per share and repurchased 1.9 million shares of our stock at an average price well below our current book value per share.”\n\nHighlights of the Quarter Ended December 31, 2023\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\n\n  * Consolidated net loss of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $40,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $935,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Consolidated return on average assets was (0.01)% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 0.19% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Consolidated return on average equity was (0.05)% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 0.99% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022\n  * Dividends declared during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, totaled $0.15 per common share.\n  * During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 545,000 shares at a cost (including the federal excise tax) of $6.2 million, or $11.36 per share. This share repurchase activity was accretive to book value per share in the amount of $0.14 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. \n  * During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost (including the federal excise tax) of $26.0 million, or $13.38 per share. This share repurchase activity was accretive to book value per share in the $0.32 during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n  * Nonperforming assets as percentage of total assets was 0.23% at December 31, 2023, 0.20% at September 30, 2023, and 0.22% at December 31, 2022. \n  * Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.68% at December 31, 2023, 0.53% at September 30, 2023, and 0.41% at December 31, 2022. \n  * Book value per share was $16.94 at December 31, 2023, and $16.71 at December 31, 2022. \n\n\n\nCommunity Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax income totaled $5.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which represents a $1.7 million, or 24.3%, decrease compared to $7.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Past due loans at the community banking segment totaled $7.9 million at December 31, 2023, $6.7 million at September 30, 2023, and $4.8 million at December 31, 2022. \n  * Net interest income totaled $12.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which represents a $3.7 million, or 23.4%, decrease compared to $15.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Average loans held for investment totaled $1.66 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $247.2 million, or 17.5%, compared to $1.41 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in the single-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate mortgages. Average loans held for investment increased $33.1 million compared to $1.63 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in single-family and commercial real estate mortgages.\n  * Net interest margin decreased 104 basis points to 2.25% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.29% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which was a result of an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. Net interest margin decreased one basis point compared to 2.26% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. \n  * The segment had a negative provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $17,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $290,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The current quarter decrease was primarily due to historical loss rates continuing to decrease. The negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was $533,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of $334,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, was due primarily to a decrease of loans in the loan commitment pipeline as loan activity decreased during the quarter and loans from the prior quarter pipeline funded. \n  * The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP ratio, was 63.26% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 54.49% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Average deposits (excluding escrow accounts) totaled $1.21 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 0.1%, compared to $1.21 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Average deposits increased $10.4 million, or 3.5% annualized, compared to the $1.20 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n  * Other noninterest expense decreased $1.8 million to $628,000 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.5 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by fees paid to the mortgage banking segment for the purchase of single-family adjustable-rate mortgage loans. These fees totaled $44,000 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.0 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\n\nMortgage Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax loss totaled $6.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.5 million of pre-tax loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Loan originations decreased $88.3 million, or 16.1%, to $458.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $546.6 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 95.7% of originations for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 95.6% of total originations for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Mortgage banking non-interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 11.3%, to $16.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $18.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\n  * Gross margin on loans sold totaled 3.51% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.41% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. \n  * Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased $2.5 million, or 14.5%, to $14.9 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease primarily related to decreased commission expense and salary expense driven by decreased loan origination volume and reduced employee headcount.\n\n\n\n**About Waterstone Financial, Inc.**\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for WaterStone Bank.

Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nCompany Release - 10/24/2023 4:01 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nWAUWATOSA, Wis., Oct. 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income of $3.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Net income per diluted share was $0.46 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\n\n“We continue to navigate the challenges that have resulted from a rapid rise in interest rates and an inverted yield curve,” said Douglas Gordon, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. “The Community Banking Segment continues to maintain strong asset quality metrics and we achieved growth in both loans held for investment and deposits during the quarter. The Mortgage Banking segment results continue to be negatively impacted by a challenging industry as inventory, housing affordability, and escalating interest rates have slowed mortgage origination volumes and compressed margins. We continue to try and find efficiencies in this environment. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $9.6 million back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends declared.”\n\nHighlights of the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)\n\n  * Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Consolidated return on average assets was 0.58% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 1.08% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Consolidated return on average equity was 3.63% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and 5.38% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Dividends declared during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, totaled $0.15 per common share.\n  * We repurchased approximately 516,000 shares at a cost (including the excise tax) of $6.7 million, or $12.94 per share, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Nonperforming assets as percentage of total assets was 0.20% at September 30, 2023, 0.19% at June 30, 2023, and 0.27% at September 30, 2022.\n  * Past due loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.53% at September 30, 2023, 0.50% at June 30, 2023, and 0.48% at September 30, 2022.\n  * Book value per share was $16.60 on September 30, 2023, and $16.71 at December 31, 2022. Book value per share increased approximately $0.10 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and approximately $0.18 during the year ended September 30, 2023, due to our share repurchase activity.\n\n\n\nCommunity Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax income totaled $5.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which represents a $2.9 million, or 33.8%, decrease compared to $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. \n  * Past due loans at the community banking segment were $6.7 million at September 30, 2023, $5.7 million at June 30, 2023, and $4.6 million at September 30, 2022.\n  * Net interest income totaled $12.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which represents a $3.1 million, or 19.8%, decrease compared to $15.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Average loans held for investment totaled $1.63 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which represents an increase of $316.3 million, or 24.1%, compared to $1.31 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in the single-family and multi-family mortgages. Average loans held for investment increased $40.3 million compared to $1.59 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the single-family, multi-family, construction, and commercial real estate mortgages.\n  * Net interest margin decreased 108 basis points to 2.26% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 3.34% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was a result of an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates. Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points compared to 2.47% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, driven by an increase in weighted average cost of deposits and borrowings as the federal funds rate increases resulted in increased funding rates.\n  * The segment had a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $206,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to a provision for credit losses related to funded loans of $262,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The current quarter increase was primarily due to an increase in originations and loan balance. The provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments was $239,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to a negative provision for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments of $28,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The increase for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to an increase of loans in the loan commitment pipeline as loan activity increased during the quarter.\n  * The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP ratio, was 54.43% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 47.16% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Average deposits (excluding escrow accounts) totaled $1.20 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $6.0 million, or 0.5%, compared to $1.19 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Average deposits increased $15.4 million, or 5.2% annualized, compared to the $1.18 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n  * Other noninterest expense decreased $774,000 to $703,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1.5 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by fees paid to the mortgage banking segment for the purchase of single-family adjustable-rate mortgage loans. These fees totaled $188,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n\n\n\nMortgage Banking Segment\n\n  * Pre-tax loss totaled $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1.8 million of pre-tax loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. \n  * Loan originations decreased $132.3 million, or 18.1%, to $597.6 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $729.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Origination volume relative to purchase activity accounted for 95.4% of originations for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 94.2% of total originations for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Mortgage banking non-interest income decreased $5.9 million, or 21.4%, to $21.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $27.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Gross margin on loans sold decreased to 3.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 3.70% for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\n  * Total compensation, payroll taxes and other employee benefits decreased $4.7 million, or 21.4%, to $17.2 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $21.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The decrease primarily related to decreased commission expense and salary expense driven by decreased loan origination volume and reduced employee headcount.\n\n\n\n**About Waterstone Financial, Inc.**\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for WaterStone Bank.

(Waterstone) today announced a strategic decision to reduce its dividend payout as part of a broader initiative to optimize capital allocation. This move is aimed at enhancing shareholder value through stock buybacks, which we believe will generate long-term benefits for both Waterstone and its shareholders. Today the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share. The dividend will be payable November 1, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2023.\n\nThe decision reflects Waterstone’s commitment to allocating capital more efficiently. The reduction in the dividend will be reallocated to efforts to repurchase shares at pricing levels that remain below tangible book value per share. “Reallocating capital towards stock buybacks is a prudent strategic move, given the current market dynamics and our strong financial position,” said Douglas Gordon, Chief Executive Officer of Waterstone Financial, Inc. “This decision aligns with our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value.”\n\nBased on yesterday's closing price, this dividend results in an annualized yield of 5.17%. While we continue to provide significant shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, we also maintain a capital to assets ratio of 15.9% as of June 30, 2023; well above regulatory requirements and our peers. The continuance of a strong capital position is prudent given the uncertain interest rate and economic environments.\n\n**About Waterstone Financial, Inc:**\n\nWaterstone Financial, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for WaterStone Bank.
