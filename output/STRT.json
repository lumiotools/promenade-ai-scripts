This compares with net sales of $135.4 million in fiscal first quarter 2024, which included $8.0 million in one-time retroactive price increases. Excluding that one-time pricing impact, adjusted net sales attributable to STRATTEC1 increased by $11.6 million, or 9.1%. \n\nAfter taking into account the impact of ongoing price increases, the following summarizes noted changes to sales: \n\n  * Sales to Hyundai/Kia increased due to timing of customer demand for power door products \n  * Sales to Ford Motor Company grew from new tailgate latch content on the Ford F-Series pickups \n  * Sales to Commercial and Other OEM customers grew from new business with Aston Martin \n  * Sales to Stellantis declined primarily due to inventory destocking and lower production volumes \n\n\n\n**FY 2025 First Quarter Operation Review**\n\n_(compared with prior-year period, except where otherwise noted)_\n\nGross profit increased $0.2 million to $18.9 million. Gross margin was 13.6% compared with 13.8% in prior-year period (which included a 470 basis point benefit from one-time pricing). \n\nAdjusted gross profit1 and adjusted gross margin1 improved as a result of favorable sales mix and change in foreign exchange (“FX”) rate of $2.7 million, improved pricing of $2.2 million, and $1.3 million reduction in raw material and purchased component costs. The favorable change in FX provided a 190 basis point benefit to gross margin between quarterly periods. These benefits more than offset unfavorable impacts of $1.4 million in higher Mexico manufacturing costs, $0.7 million of accrual for short-term incentive bonus plans and $0.4 million of expedited shipping costs. \n\n_($ in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \n**Gross profit** |  **$** |  **18,921** |  **$** |  **18,720**  \nAdd back (deduct):   \nRetroactive pricing  |  -  |  (7,100  |  )   \n**Adjusted Gross Profit 1** |  **$** |  **18,921** |  **$** |  **11,620**  \nNet sales  |  $  |  139,052  |  $  |  135,406   \nAdjusted Net Sales |  $  |  139,052  |  $  |  127,406   \nGross margin  |  13.6  |  %  |  13.8  |  %   \nAdjusted Gross Margin  |  13.6  |  %  |  9.1  |  %   \n  \n_See Reconciliation of Net Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin to non-GAAP Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin on Page 8_  \n---  \n  \nEngineering, selling and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million, or 9.9%, to $13.9 million primarily due to increased accrual for short-term incentive plan compensation and organizational investments. As a result, operating income decreased $1.0 million to $5.1 million compared with the prior-year period. Last year’s first quarter benefited by \n\n$7.1 million for the one-time pricing impact. \n\nNet income attributable to STRATTEC was $3.7 million compared with $4.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.92 compared with $1.05 last year. Adjusted net income attributable to STRATTEC1 was $3.7 million compared with a loss of $0.6 million in last fiscal year’s first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.92 compared with a loss of $0.14 in the prior-year period. \n\n1  _Adjusted net sales,_  _adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted net income attributable to STRATTEC and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measure.

Capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $2.1 million, compared with $2.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. \n\nAt September 29, 2024, STRATTEC had $34.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $25.4 million at June 30, 2024. Pre-production costs, which are primarily related to customer tooling, declined $6.9 million. The Company’s objective is to return the customer tooling balance to approximately $10 million by the end of the fiscal year. \n\nThe Company’s 51% joint venture subsidiary ADAC-STRATTEC LLC had $13.0 million in debt, unchanged from the end of fiscal 2024. STRATTEC had $40 million and ADAC-STRATTEC LLC had $7 million in borrowing capacity as of September 29, 2024. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today to review the financial and operating results for the period ended September 29, 2024.

Nevertheless, STRATTEC believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures are important for investors and other readers of the Company’s financial statements and assists in understanding the comparison of the current quarter’s financial results to the historical periods' financial results. \n\n**Reconciliation of Net Sales to Adjusted Net Sales**  \n---  \n($ in thousands)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \nNet sales (GAAP)  |  $  |  139,052  |  $  |  135,406   \nOne-time retroactive pricing from customers  |  -  |  (8,000  |  )   \nAdjusted net sales  |  $  |  139,052  |  $  |  127,406   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit**  \n---  \n($ in thousands)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \nGross profit (GAAP)  |  $  |  18,921  |  $  |  18,720   \nOne-time retroactive pricing from customers  |  -  |  (8,000  |  )   \nOne-time retroactive pricing to suppliers  |  -  |  900   \nAdjusted gross profit  |  $  |  18,921  |  $  |  11,620   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Gross Margin to Adjusted Gross Margin**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \nGross margin (GAAP)  |  13.6  |  %  |  13.8  |  %   \nOne-time retroactive pricing from customers  |  (5.4  |  )   \nOne-time retroactive pricing to suppliers  |  -  |  0.7   \nAdjusted gross margin  |  13.6  |  %  |  9.1  |  %   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to STRATTEC to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to STRATTEC**  \n---  \n($ in thousands)  |  **Three Months Ended**  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \nNet income attributable to STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (GAAP)  |  $  |  3,703  |  $  |  4,165   \nOne-time retroactive pricing from customers  |  -  |  (8,000  |  )   \nOne-time retroactive pricing to suppliers  |  -  |  900   \nNon-controlling interest impact of retroactive pricing  |  -  |  1,014   \nTax impact of retroactive pricing (1) |  -  |  1,364   \nAdjusted net income attributable to STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION |  $  |  3,703  |  $  |  (557  |  )   \n  \n**Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings Per Share to Adjusted Earnings Per Share**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**9/29/2024** |  **10/1/2023**  \nDiluted earnings per share (GAAP)  |  $  |  0.92  |  $  |  1.05   \nOne-time retroactive pricing from customers  |  -  |  (2.01  |  )   \nOne-time retroactive pricing to suppliers  |  -  |  0.23   \nNon-controlling interest impact of retroactive pricing  |  -  |  0.26   \nTax impact of retroactive pricing (1) |  -  |  0.34   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  0.92  |  $  |  (0.14  |  )   \n(1) The tax impact is calculated using the statutory tax rate for the impacted jurisdiction   \n  \n**Supplemental Information**\n\n**Impact of Retroactive Pricing in Fiscal Year 2024**  \n---  \n($ in thousands)   \n**One-time Pricing Impact to:** |  **Q1 FY2024** |  **Q2 FY2024** |  **Q3 FY2024** |  **Q4 FY2024** |  **FY 2024**  \nNet Sales |  $  |  8,000  |  $  |  1,600  |  NM(1)  |  NM  |  $  |  9,700   \nCost of Goods Sold(2) |  (900  |  )  |  (910  |  )  |  -  |  -  |  (1,700  |  )   \n**Gross Profit** |  **$** |  **7,100** |  **$** |  **690** |  **NM** |  **NM** |  **$** |  **8,000**  \nGross Margin Contribution  |  4.7  |  %  |  2.4  |  %  |  NM  |  NM  |  1.3  |  %   \n  \n_(1) Not meaningful_  \n---  \n_(2) After factoring in impact of supplier one-time price increases_  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241104421525r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241104421525/en/>\n\n**Investors:** Deborah K.

Quarter and Full Year Operating Results\n\nAugust 8, 2024 at 4:00 PM EDT\n\n[Download PDF](/node/13196/pdf)\n\n**Fourth Fiscal Quarter earnings per share $2.39 vs $0.69 loss, an improvement driven by customer price increases and higher sales**\n\nMILWAUKEE, Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (NASDAQ:STRT) is a market leader of a comprehensive range of \"Smart\" Vehicle Power Access and Electronic and Security Solutions, serving the global automotive industry.\n\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights\n\n  * Diluted earnings per share of $2.39 versus $0.69 loss last year\n  * Gross Margins expanded to 13.0% compared with 9.3% last year\n  * Revenues increased by 8.2%, driven by pricing increases and new product sales\n\n\n\nSTRATTEC President and CEO Jennifer Slater said, “The financial performance of the business continued due to improved pricing, and new product introductions which are expanding STRATTEC’s offerings to our customers. We will continue to focus on addressing persistent cost challenges and the opportunities we have to optimize our working capital and a strong balance sheet.”\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Financial Summary(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n\nThree Months Ended | Year Ended  \n---|---  \nJune 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023 | June 30, 2024 | July 2, 2023  \nNet Sales | $ | 143,055 | $ | 132,219 | $ | 537,766 | $ | 492,946  \nGross Profit | $ | 18,567 | $ | 12,268 | $ | 65,468 | $ | 42,152  \nGross Margin | 13.0 | % | 9.3 | % | 12.2 | % | 8.6 | %  \nOperating Expenses | $ | 8,876 | $ | 10,975 | $ | 47,654 | $ | 48,241  \nOperating Income (Loss) from Operations | $ | 9,691 | $ | 1,293 | $ | 17,814 | $ | (6,089 | )  \nNet Income (Loss) | $ | 9,620 | $ | (2,700 | ) | $ | 16,313 | $ | (6,670 | )  \nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share | $ | 2.39 | $ | (0.69 | ) | $ | 4.07 | $ | (1.70 | )  \n  \nFourth Quarter Financial Overview\n\nRevenue growth was driven by $6.9 million of price increases to our major customers and $3.9 million of higher sales associated with the launch of new product programs, the latter representing a 3.0% growth in sales from prior year. The growth in new product sales primarily stems from additional content of our latch and power access product lines on a major truck platform.\n\nGross margin improvement was primarily driven by pricing increases, higher sales and lower raw material costs. Offsetting those positive trends was primarily $2.1 million of wage increases due to a mandatory Mexican minimum wage-increase, $1.7 million for increase in the company’s annual incentive bonus plan, $1.2 million higher prices paid to certain suppliers, $1.1 million of higher warranty costs, $1.0 million of increased freight costs primarily related to the launch of new programs, and $660,000 of unfavorable U.S. dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate effects.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in customer billings for the reimbursement of development costs, offset by a $1.1 increase in the company’s annual incentive bonus plan. Other Income was $2.0 million compared to a loss of $1.1 million last year due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year and losses in the prior year. Net Income was $9.6 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million last year. Fully diluted earnings per share were $2.39 compared with a loss of $0.69 last year.\n\nFull Year Financial Overview\n\nFull year revenue growth of $44.8 million was primarily driven by $32.7 million of customer pricing of which $9.7 million relates to one-time retroactive pricing that is not expected to recur in the future. Total gross margins improved by $23.3 million due to customer pricing, higher sales, lower raw material costs and salaried staff reductions and production efficiencies in Mexico, offset primarily by $5.7 million of higher prices paid to key suppliers, $8.5 million of unfavorable exchange rate impact between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso, $6.6 million of mandatory Mexican minimum wage increases and $4.1 million of higher shipping costs, primarily attributable to expediting associated with new product launches. Operating expenses were $587,000 lower due to $3.4 million increase in customer billings for the reimbursement of engineering development costs offset primarily by $1.0 million in one-time charges associated with the transition of the Chief Executive Officer position and $1.9 million of annual incentive bonus expense. Net Income was $16.3 million compared to a loss of $6.7 million last year. Fully diluted earnings per share were $4.07 compared with a loss of $1.70 last year.\n\nFourth Quarter Balance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $25.4 million. Total debt as of June 30, 2024 was $13.0 million, which was all held by the ADAC-STRATTEC LLC joint venture.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, operating cash flow was $19.4 million, compared to the prior year quarter operating cash flow of $2.6 million. The operating cash flow for the current quarter was driven by improved operating performance and a reduction in net working capital. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 were $3.7 million, compared with $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAbout STRATTEC\n\nSTRATTEC designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive Access Control Products, including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding side door systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, power tailgate systems for trucks, door handles and related products.

executive as CEO\n\nJune 14, 2024 at 8:00 AM EDT\n\n[Download PDF](/node/13166/pdf)\n\nMILWAUKEE, June 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors (“Board”) of STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (NASDAQ:STRT) (the “Company”) is proud to announce the appointment of Jennifer L. Slater as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Board member, each effective July 1, 2024. Slater is a senior executive at Sensata Technologies, Inc. with over 25 years of experience as a leader and a manager. Her experience includes general management, engineering, finance, sales and strategy. She has delivered results for owners across a diverse set of enterprises that include publicly traded companies, privately held firms, and private equity owners.\n\nBoard Chair, F. Jack Liebau, Jr., said that, “Slater is the right choice to lead the Company considering her extensive experience in the automotive industry. We are delighted to welcome Jen to STRATTEC – her past successes with critical leadership initiatives at major companies demonstrated that she is the right person for the job. Her focus on growth and increasing shareholder value is in step with the Board’s goals.”\n\nLiebau continued, “We thank Rolando Guilott for his effective efforts as our interim President and Chief Executive Officer. We’re grateful for his hard work, leadership, and dedication to the shareholders, employees, and clients of STRATTEC. I’d also like to thank the Board’s search committee, led by Board member Tina Chang, for its tireless work. Jen immediately emerged as the top candidate of the committee, comprised of Tina, Tom Florsheim, Bruce Lisman, and me.”\n\nSlater is currently the Executive Vice President and General Manager, Performance Sensing, for Sensata Technologies, Inc. In the past year, she led the business through a significant transformation to an electrified product and systems business from an internal combustion business. She did that with a balanced focus on near term execution and intermediate term goals to deliver on a five year growth plan. Slater has delivered strong results and innovative solutions, as she moves from vision and strategy to execution.\n\nSlater currently serves as a director for Valvoline Inc. She previously worked as Group Vice President and General Manager Global OE for Clarios, LLC, where she was responsible for shaping all aspects of the advanced technology, product management, engineering and launch to support the growth of a $3.3 billion battery business. She worked at Johnson Controls International plc for 11 years in a series of senior positions, finishing her time there as Vice President Finance, Power Solutions.\n\nSlater said she is excited to lead the prominent automotive parts manufacturer. “I am honored and thrilled to lead this well-respected manufacturer as we all work together to position STRATTEC for continued growth in the automotive products industry. I am looking forward to leveraging my experience with the support of the talented employees of the company to continue to make an impact,” Slater continued.\n\nA graduate of the University of Michigan at Dearborn, Slater also earned her master’s degree in business administration from Walsh College. She has been active in the Milwaukee community, including being the Milwaukee lead for a volunteer program that brings science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to life and helps to spark the interest for elementary students into engineering professions and is looking forward to continuing to support the community.\n\nAbout STRATTEC\n\nSTRATTEC designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive Access Control Products, including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding side door systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, power tailgate systems for trucks, door handles and related products.

Quarter Operating Results\n\nMay 9, 2024 at 4:00 PM EDT\n\n[Download PDF](/node/13116/pdf)\n\n**Third Fiscal Quarter earnings per share $0.37 vs $0.57 loss, an improvement driven by customer pricing increases and higher sales**\n\nMILWAUKEE, May 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (NASDAQ:STRT) is a market leader of a comprehensive range of \"Smart\" Vehicle Power Access and Electronic and Security Solutions, serving the global automotive industry.\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights\n\n  * Diluted earnings per share of $0.37 versus $0.57 loss last year\n  * Gross Margins expanded to 10.4% compared with 7.9% last year\n  * Revenues increased by 10.7%, driven by pricing increases and new product sales\n\n\n\nSTRATTEC Interim CEO Rolando Guillot said, “This quarter we continued to make progress on our financial performance due to improved pricing and new product introductions that are expanding STRATTEC’s offerings to our customers. We will continue to focus on addressing persistent cost challenges and the opportunities we have to optimize our working capital and a strong balance sheet.”\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Summary\n\nThird Quarter Ending  \n---  \nMar 31, 2024 | Apr. 2, 2023 | Inc (Dec)  \n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  \nNet Sales | $ | 140,773 | $ | 127,183 | $ | 13,590  \nGross Profit | $ | 14,684 | $ | 10,001 | $ | 4,683  \nGross Margin | 10.4 | % | 7.9 | %  \nOperating Expenses | $ | 12,725 | $ | 12,485 | $ | 240  \nOperating Income (Loss) from Operations | $ | 1,959 | $ | (2,484 | ) | $ | 4,443  \nNet Income (Loss) | $ | 1,506 | $ | (2,256 | ) | $ | 3,762  \nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share | $ | 0.37 | $ | (0.57 | ) | $ | 0.94  \n  \nRevenue growth was driven by $7.0 million of price increases to our major customers and $6.6 million of higher sales associated with the launch of new product programs, the latter representing a 5.2% growth in sales from prior year. The growth in new product sales primarily stems from additional content of our latch and power access product lines on a major truck platform.\n\nGross margin improvement was driven by pricing increases, higher sales, lower raw material costs, lower warranty costs and $384,000 of workforce and production efficiencies realized from our Mexican operations. Offsetting those positive trends were unfavorable absorption of labor and overhead costs with inventory reductions, $2.1 million of unfavorable U.S. dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate effects, $1.8 million of wage increases due to a mandatory Mexican minimum wage-increase, $1.2 million higher prices paid to certain suppliers and $778,000 of increased freight costs primarily related to the launch of new programs.\n\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to a $817,000 expense associated with the company’s annual incentive bonus plan, which was partially offset with lower new product development costs compared with the prior year period. Net Income was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $2.3 million last year. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.37 compared with a loss of $0.57 last year.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $9.6 million. Total debt as of March 31, 2024 was $13.0 million, which was all held by the ADAC-STRATTEC LLC joint venture.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2024, operating cash flow was negative $309,000, compared to the prior year quarter operating cash flow of negative $1.2 million. The negative operating cash flow for the current quarter was driven by a temporary increase in working capital, specifically in accounts receivable related to higher sales in the quarter, partially offset by a $10.8 million reduction in inventory. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $1.7 million, compared with $4.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAbout STRATTEC\n\nSTRATTEC designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive Access Control Products, including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding side door systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, power tailgate systems for trucks, door handles and related products.

Quarter Operating Results\n\nFebruary 8, 2024 at 4:00 PM EST\n\n[Download PDF](/node/13061/pdf)\n\n**Second Fiscal Quarter earnings per share $0.26 vs $0.47 loss, an improvement driven by customer pricing increases**\n\nMILWAUKEE, Wis., Feb. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION (NASDAQ:STRT) is a market leader of a comprehensive range of \"Smart\" Vehicle Power Access and Electronic and Security Solutions, serving the global automotive industry.\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Highlights\n\n  * Diluted earnings per share of $0.26 versus $0.47 loss last year\n  * Gross Margins expanded to 11.4% compared with 6.5% last year\n  * Revenues increased by 4.7%, driven by pricing increases with major customers\n\n\n\nSTRATTEC Interim CEO Rolando Guillot said, “This quarter demonstrated the progress we are making in improving our financial performance. It also highlighted opportunities to optimize our working capital and strong balance sheet. We intend to take advantage of a more predictable supply chain to bring greater efficiencies to our operations. Looking forward, we will focus on new product introductions that will expand STRATTEC’s offerings to our customers.”\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Summary\n\nSecond Quarter Ending  \n---  \nDec. 31, 2023 | Jan. 1, 2023 | Inc (Dec)  \n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  \nNet Sales | $ | 118,532 | $ | 113,184 | $ | 5,348  \nGross Profit | $ | 13,497 | $ | 7,387 | $ | 6,110  \nGross Margin | 11.4 | % | 6.5 | %  \nOperating Expenses | $ | 13,439 | $ | 12,081 | $ | 1,358  \nOperating Income | $ | 58 | $ | (4,694 | ) | $ | 4,752  \nNet Income | $ | 1,022 | $ | (1,839 | ) | $ | 2,861  \nDiluted Earnings Per Share | $ | 0.26 | $ | (0.47 | ) | $ | 0.73  \n  \nRevenue growth was driven primarily by pricing increases to our major customers. Those price increases were $8.0 million, of which $3.8 million represents ongoing pricing increases. Total pricing increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decline in net sales, primarily due to lower sales to a major customer and some effects of the UAW strike against the U.S. auto industry in October.\n\nGross margin improvement was driven by pricing increases, lower raw material costs, operating leverage from higher production levels and $780,000 of efficiencies realized from our Mexican operations. Offsetting those positive trends were higher prices paid to certain suppliers, $2.5 million of unfavorable U.S. dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate effects, $1.3 million of wage increases due to a mandatory Mexican minimum wage-increase and $1.3 million higher freight costs.\n\nOne-time costs of $900,000 associated with the retirement of our former CEO were recorded during the quarter. In addition, higher development expenses in support of new products also impacted results, largely explaining the remaining $458,000 increase in expenses. Net Income was $1.0 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million last year. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.26 compared with a loss of $0.47 last year.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents on hand totaled $11.6 million. Total debt as of December 31, 2023 was $13.0 million, which was all held by the ADAC-STRATTEC LLC joint venture.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2024, cash flow provided by operations was negative $3.0 million, compared to the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operations of $4.0 million. The decrease in cash flow for the current quarter was driven by temporary increases in working capital, specifically inventory, customer tooling in progress and a value added tax recoverable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $1.5 million, compared with $4.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs announced on January 5, 2024, F. Jack Liebau, Jr. has been appointed Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and Harold M. Stratton II has been appointed Vice Chairman of the Board. \"As Board Chairman, I look forward to working with the Board in the near term to improve governance policies consistent with current best practices while strengthening the Company’s focus on providing long-term shareholder returns,\" Mr. Liebau said. \n\nAbout STRATTEC\n\nSTRATTEC designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive Access Control Products, including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding side door systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, power tailgate systems for trucks, door handles and related products.
