Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “At the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024 in September, we presented promising data on NUC-7738, a novel agent that profoundly impacts gene expression in cancer cells and targets multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment. The data from the Phase 2 part of the NuTide:701 study in PD-1 inhibitor-resistant melanoma showed that 9 of the 12 patients achieved disease control when treated with NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab. One of these patients, who had received two prior lines of PD-1 inhibitor-based therapy and had progressed on their latest treatment of ipilimumab plus nivolumab within two months, achieved a 55% reduction in tumor volume. Given the typically poor outcomes in this patient population, with a median progression-free survival of just two to three months under current standard care, we are highly encouraged by the results showing a median progression-free survival of over five months for patients receiving NUC-7738 plus pembrolizumab.”\n\nMr. Griffith added, “We also announced the issuance of a new patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office covering NUC-7738’s composition of matter. This patent (US12,054,510) is expected to serve as a key component of the intellectual property protection for NUC-7738, which currently consists of over 80 issued patents worldwide.”\n\nMr. Griffith continued, “We recently announced initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b/2 NuTide:303 study of NUC-3373, a targeted thymidylate synthase inhibitor with immune modulating properties, in a manuscript authored by the study’s lead investigators. In this study, NUC-3373 is being combined with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and with docetaxel in patients with lung cancer. Results from the study indicate that NUC-3373 may promote an anti-tumor immune response and potentiate the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We were particularly encouraged to see significant tumor volume reductions and prolonged progression free survival, including a patient with urothelial bladder cancer who achieved 100% reduction in their target lesions. While we were disappointed with the previously announced discontinuation of the NuTide:323 study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, we remain optimistic about the potential of NUC-3373.”\n\nMr. Griffith concluded, “Our unwavering commitment to improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer drives our relentless pursuit of the development of new anti-cancer agents. We look forward to progressing these exciting new medicines and sharing future development plans for NUC-7738 and NUC-3373.”\n\n**2025 Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * NUC-7738 \n\n    * Initiate an expansion of the Phase 1/2 study (NuTide:701) of NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma; \n\n    * Announce data from the Phase 1/2 expansion study (NuTide:701) of NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab; and\n\n    * Obtain regulatory guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on pivotal study design for NUC-7738 in melanoma. \n\n  * NUC-3373 \n\n    * Initiate an expansion of the Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors; and \n\n    * Announce data from the Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors.\n\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights and Cash Position**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, NuCana had cash and cash equivalents of £11.4 million compared to £11.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and £17.2 million at December 31, 2023. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the third quarter was primarily the result of cash used in operating activities, partially offset by £4.7 million in net proceeds raised through its at-the-market (ATM) offering. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, NuCana has raised an additional £1.8 million in net proceeds through its ATM offering. NuCana expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with amounts raised through its ATM offering subsequent to that date, will be sufficient to fund its planned operations into Q2 2025. \n\nNuCana continues to advance its clinical programs and reported a net loss of £4.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of £6.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Basic and diluted loss per ordinary share was £0.07 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to £0.13 per ordinary share for the comparable quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**About NuCana**\n\nNuCana is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our ProTide technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid and hematological tumors, they have significant shortcomings that limit their efficacy and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome the key limitations of nucleoside analogs and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells. NuCana’s pipeline includes NUC-3373 and NUC-7738. NUC-3373 is a new chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapy agent. NUC-3373 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel for patients with lung cancer. NUC-7738 is a novel anti-cancer agent that disrupts RNA polyadenylation, profoundly impacts gene expression in cancer cells and targets multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment. NUC-7738 is in the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 study which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** _This press release may contain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on the beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management of NuCana plc (the “Company”).

The majority of patients (n=9) had received prior PD-(L)1 based therapy. Encouraging signals of anti-cancer activity were observed with confirmed Partial Responses in 2 patients and Stable Disease in a further four patients, resulting in an objective response rate of 22% and a disease control rate of 67% in the efficacy evaluable population. The combination of NUC-3373 plus pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated.\n\n_Module 1 Selected Case Studies: NUC-3373 plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors_\n\n  * 72-year-old patient with urothelial bladder cancer (Lynch syndrome) who had previously received gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab (achieved a Partial Response and remained on therapy for 23 months). Following treatment with NUC-3373 plus pembrolizumab, the patient achieved 100% reduction in the target lesion (considered a confirmed Partial Response due to the presence of non-target lesions) and remains on treatment for over 10 months.\n  * 75-year-old patient with BRAF mutant metastatic cutaneous melanoma who had previously received pembrolizumab (best response of Progressive Disease within 5 months) followed by dabrafenib plus trametinib (discontinued trametinib after 1 month due to toxicity and achieved Stable Disease before progressing after seven years on dabrafenib). Following treatment with NUC-3373 plus pembrolizumab, this patient achieved a confirmed Partial Response with an 81% reduction in the target lesion and remains on treatment for over 12 months.\n\n\n\nModule 2 included 4 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pleural mesothelioma who had disease progression on, or were unable to tolerate, prior chemotherapy-containing regimens. Docetaxel is the current standard of care for NSCLC patients without targetable alterations who progress on PD-(L)1 inhibitor-based therapy, however, it is associated with modest clinical benefit (median PFS of 3-4 months) and substantial toxicity. Following treatment of the first 4 patients in this module, enrollment was put on hold due to toxicity challenges with docetaxel. Despite this, 2 patients achieved prolonged Stable Disease. Protocol modifications to include the use of a different taxane in this combination are currently being considered.\n\n_Module 2 Selected Case Studies: NUC-3373 plus docetaxel in patients with lung cancer_\n\n  * 60-year-old patient with pleural mesothelioma who had previously received carboplatin plus pemetrexed (progressed within 4 months), the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (progressed within 4 months), and carboplatin plus pemetrexed (progressed within 1 month). Following treatment with NUC-3373 plus docetaxel, the patient achieved Stable Disease for more than 13 months (ongoing).\n  * 77-year-old patient with squamous NSCLC who had previously received carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab (Stable Disease for 2 months) followed by maintenance pembrolizumab (progressed within 21 months). Following treatment with NUC-3373 plus docetaxel, the patient achieved Stable Disease for 7 months.\n\n\n\nFull details can be found in the publication: [Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MgUdorQKdmikHsjC0LKl01KPSwyDaTzk5-zeMnpLvl6J8UxIr2sVzIsP6rPdbJOGShFuFozJ7hDh49fF62XMEdXEadVCUmTTBtEmzeMZhah6HDDJ7k6t0snl7BqlNUAh)\n\nProfessor David Harrison, NuCana’s Head of Translational Medicine, stated: “We previously presented data on NUC-3373’s ability to elicit the release of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), promote an anti-tumor immune response, and potentiate the activity of PD-1 inhibitors in human cancer cell lines. These data led us to investigate the combination of NUC-3373 plus pembrolizumab so we are very excited to observe these encouraging clinical findings in PD-(L)1 inhibitor experienced patients.”\n\nProfessor Harrison continued: “We have also demonstrated that NUC-3373 is a very potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor and causes DNA damage, leading us to hypothesize that NUC-3373 may be an attractive alternative to pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC and mesothelioma. Observing that NUC-3373 in combination with docetaxel is stabilizing disease in these hard-to-treat patient populations provides further evidence supporting this hypothesis.”\n\nHugh S. Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are very excited that these NUC-3373 combinations have been observed to provide a meaningful clinical benefit to patients who had exhausted all other treatment options. We recently presented encouraging efficacy and safety data at ESMO on NUC-7738 plus pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma who were refractory or resistant to PD-1 inhibitors. We are pleased to have two Phase 2 product candidates in our portfolio, each with a distinct mechanism of action, that can potentiate PD-1 inhibitors in PD-(L)1 resistant patients. We look forward to sharing additional data from the NuTide:303 study and our clinical development plans for both NUC-3373 and NUC-7738 in the near future.”\n\n**About NuCana** NuCana is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our ProTide technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines.

This patent (US12,054,510) is expected to serve as a key component of the intellectual property protection for NUC-7738, which currently consists of over 80 issued patents worldwide. NUC-7738 is a novel anti-cancer agent currently in a Phase 2 clinical study in combination with pembrolizumab in PD-1 inhibitor resistant melanoma patients, for which NuCana presented encouraging data at the ESMO Congress 2024 earlier this month.\n\nHugh S. Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer said: “We welcome the USPTO’s decision to grant this important new patent, which further strengthens the intellectual property protection of NUC-7738. This patent issuance follows our recent data presentation at ESMO which supports NUC-7738’s novel mode of action and its ability to make previously resistant tumors sensitive to rechallenge with PD-1 inhibitors by targeting multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment. The majority of these PD-1 inhibitor resistant metastatic melanoma patients achieved a progression free survival of more than 5 months with NUC-7738 plus pembrolizumab. These results are very encouraging as the median progression free survival in this patient population is 2-3 months with the current standard of care. We look forward to advancing the development of this promising new anti-cancer agent.”\n\n**About NuCana**\n\nNuCana is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our ProTide technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid and hematological tumors, they have significant shortcomings that limit their efficacy and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome the key limitations of nucleoside analogs and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells. NuCana’s pipeline includes NUC-3373 and NUC-7738. NUC-3373 is a new chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapy agent. NUC-3373 is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical studies: a Phase 1b/2 study (NuTide:302) in combination with leucovorin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer; and a Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel for patients with lung cancer. NUC-7738 is a novel anti-cancer agent that disrupts RNA polyadenylation, profoundly impacts gene expression in cancer cells and targets multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment. NUC-7738 is in the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 study (NuTide:701) which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** _This press release may contain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on the beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management of NuCana plc (the “Company”).
