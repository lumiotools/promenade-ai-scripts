Reports Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\nBLACKSBURG, VA., October 24, 2024 -- National Bankshares, Inc. (“the Company”)(Nasdaq: NKSH), parent company of The National Bank of Blacksburg (“the Bank”) and National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc., today announced its results of operations through the third quarter of 2024.The Company reported net income of $4.54 million or $0.75 per basic common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.This compares with net income of $11.51 million or $1.95 per basic common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $2.68 million or $0.42 per basic common share. This compares with net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 of $3.07 million or $0.52 per basic common share. National Bankshares, Inc. ended September 30, 2024 with total assets of $1.79 billion. \n\nPresident and CEO F. Brad Denardo commented, \"Year-to-date earnings remain burdened by high interest expense, but we were pleased with the positive income statement trends in the third quarter.While 2024 has presented a difficult earnings environment, it has also been a building year for National Bankshares.Our acquisition of three branch offices in new markets, along with the upcoming opening of a newly constructed office in Roanoke, demonstrate our commitment to growth and to increasing long-term shareholder value.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n_Merger: Income Statement Impacts_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded merger-related expense of $2.89 million. Upon acquisition of the Frontier Community Bank (“FCB”) loans, the Company recorded a provision for credit loss of $1.29 million.\n\n_Merger: Balance Sheet Impacts_\n\nConsideration for the acquisition of FCB totaled $16.35 million, including $14.30 million in shares of the Company’s common stock and $2.05 million in cash for shareholder elections, fractional shares and to settle outstanding options. \n\nThe transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with acquired assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.Key items are presented in the following table as of the merger date: \n\n**($ in thousands, except per share data)** |  **June 1, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Assets acquired at fair value**  \nCash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits, and federal funds sold |  **$** |  **8,934**  \nSecurities available for sale |  **9,320**  \nLoans |  **118,743**  \nGoodwill (provisional) |  **4,874**  \nCore deposit intangible |  **2,100**  \nBank-owned life insurance |  **2,666**  \n**Liabilities acquired at fair value**  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits |  **$** |  **17,303**  \nInterest-bearing demand deposits |  **40,367**  \nSavings deposits |  **5,613**  \nTime deposits |  **66,434**  \nTotal deposits |  **$** |  **129,717**  \nBorrowings |  **5,230**  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \n464,855 shares of common stock issued, $1.25 par value, and additional paid in capital |  **$** |  **14,299**  \n  \nWithin a short period following the merger, the Company sold FCB’s securities and repaid its borrowings.\n\n_Net Interest Income_\n\nThe net interest margin improved when the third quarter of 2024 is compared with the second quarter of 2024, with increases in loan yields that outpaced increases in deposit costs.The impact of the FCB acquisition benefited the full third quarter, while impacting only one month of the second quarter. Many of the Company’s loans are adjustable with repricing dates in the future.If rates remain at the current level or do not decrease substantially, repricing will continue to contribute to improved interest income.\n\nThe cost of deposits increased when compared with the second quarter due to the acquisition and continued competitive pressure.The Federal Reserve's rate cut in September immediately decreased interest expense for adjustable-rate deposits. The Company continuously monitors its deposit base and funding costs.\n\n_Noninterest Income_\n\nWhen the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared with the same period of 2023, service charges on deposits increased due to an updated fee schedule and the FCB acquisition.Trust income increased due to expansion in assets under management.Noninterest income for 2023 reflects payout of a BOLI policy, gain on the sale of an investment in VISA Class B shares, and loss on the sale of securities.\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased slightly when compared with the second quarter of 2024, due to the FCB acquisition and positive trends in Trust income.\n\n_Noninterest Expense_\n\nNoninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased when compared with the same period of 2023, due to the FCB acquisition and a contract termination expense. During 2023, the Company reported expenses, included in professional services, associated with a proxy contest.\n\nWhen the third quarter of 2024 is compared with the second quarter of 2024, noninterest expense decreased.The majority of merger-related expenses were recorded during the second quarter.Other categories increased due to the FCB acquisition and marketing expenses to promote the acquired branches and the soon to open Roanoke branch.\n\n_Securities_\n\nMarket interest rate expectations at September 30, 2024 improved the fair value of securities when compared with June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, reflecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut in September 2024. The Company’s Asset Liability Management Committee closely monitors interest rate risk on all of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities.As of September 30, 2024, the Company has the ability to hold securities until maturity.Analysis as of September 30, 2024 did not indicate credit risk concerns with any of the Company’s securities.\n\n_Deposits_ The Company’s depositors within its market areas are diverse and include individuals, businesses and municipalities.The Company does not have any brokered deposits.Depositors are insured up to the FDIC maximum of $250 thousand.Municipal deposits, which account for approximately 22% of the Company’s deposits, have additional security from bonds pledged as collateral, in accordance with state regulation.Of the Company’s non-municipal deposits, approximately 22% are uninsured. \n\n_Liquidity_\n\nThe Company’s liquidity position remains solid.The Company maintains borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) and the Federal Reserve that provide substantial borrowing capacity.During 2023, the Company accessed short-term borrowings with the FHLB and Federal Reserve to reinforce liquidity.The advances were fully repaid due to the success of the Company’s deposit strategy.Combined with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, positive results of the latest liquidity stress testing and success of deposit marketing, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet foreseeable liquidity demands.\n\n_Loans_\n\nLoans increased from June 30, 2024, driven by growth in consumer real estate and commercial real estate loans. The Company is positioned to continue to make every loan that meets its underwriting standards.\n\n_Credit Quality_\n\nLoan metrics continue to reflect low credit risk, with low charge-off and past due levels.\n\n_Stockholders’ Equity_\n\nStockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 increased when compared with 2023 primarily due to the acquisition and improvement in the unrealized loss on securities, which is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.Accumulated other comprehensive loss is excluded from the Bank’s regulatory capital and does not affect regulatory capital ratios.The Bank is considered well capitalized, with capital ratios substantially higher than minimum regulatory requirements, and meets all requirements for borrowing from the FHLB.\n\n**About National Bankshares**\n\nNational Bankshares, Inc., headquartered in Blacksburg, Virginia, is the parent company of The National Bank of Blacksburg, which does business as National Bank, and of National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc.

Reports Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\nBLACKSBURG, VA., October 24, 2024 -- National Bankshares, Inc. (“the Company”)(Nasdaq: NKSH), parent company of The National Bank of Blacksburg (“the Bank”) and National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc., today announced its results of operations through the third quarter of 2024.The Company reported net income of $4.54 million or $0.75 per basic common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.This compares with net income of $11.51 million or $1.95 per basic common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $2.68 million or $0.42 per basic common share. This compares with net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 of $3.07 million or $0.52 per basic common share. National Bankshares, Inc. ended September 30, 2024 with total assets of $1.79 billion. \n\nPresident and CEO F. Brad Denardo commented, \"Year-to-date earnings remain burdened by high interest expense, but we were pleased with the positive income statement trends in the third quarter.While 2024 has presented a difficult earnings environment, it has also been a building year for National Bankshares.Our acquisition of three branch offices in new markets, along with the upcoming opening of a newly constructed office in Roanoke, demonstrate our commitment to growth and to increasing long-term shareholder value.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n_Merger: Income Statement Impacts_\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded merger-related expense of $2.89 million. Upon acquisition of the Frontier Community Bank (“FCB”) loans, the Company recorded a provision for credit loss of $1.29 million.\n\n_Merger: Balance Sheet Impacts_\n\nConsideration for the acquisition of FCB totaled $16.35 million, including $14.30 million in shares of the Company’s common stock and $2.05 million in cash for shareholder elections, fractional shares and to settle outstanding options. \n\nThe transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with acquired assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.Key items are presented in the following table as of the merger date: \n\n**($ in thousands, except per share data)** |  **June 1, 2024**  \n---|---  \n**Assets acquired at fair value**  \nCash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits, and federal funds sold |  **$** |  **8,934**  \nSecurities available for sale |  **9,320**  \nLoans |  **118,743**  \nGoodwill (provisional) |  **4,874**  \nCore deposit intangible |  **2,100**  \nBank-owned life insurance |  **2,666**  \n**Liabilities acquired at fair value**  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits |  **$** |  **17,303**  \nInterest-bearing demand deposits |  **40,367**  \nSavings deposits |  **5,613**  \nTime deposits |  **66,434**  \nTotal deposits |  **$** |  **129,717**  \nBorrowings |  **5,230**  \n**Stockholders' Equity**  \n464,855 shares of common stock issued, $1.25 par value, and additional paid in capital |  **$** |  **14,299**  \n  \nWithin a short period following the merger, the Company sold FCB’s securities and repaid its borrowings.\n\n_Net Interest Income_\n\nThe net interest margin improved when the third quarter of 2024 is compared with the second quarter of 2024, with increases in loan yields that outpaced increases in deposit costs.The impact of the FCB acquisition benefited the full third quarter, while impacting only one month of the second quarter. Many of the Company’s loans are adjustable with repricing dates in the future.If rates remain at the current level or do not decrease substantially, repricing will continue to contribute to improved interest income.\n\nThe cost of deposits increased when compared with the second quarter due to the acquisition and continued competitive pressure.The Federal Reserve's rate cut in September immediately decreased interest expense for adjustable-rate deposits. The Company continuously monitors its deposit base and funding costs.\n\n_Noninterest Income_\n\nWhen the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared with the same period of 2023, service charges on deposits increased due to an updated fee schedule and the FCB acquisition.Trust income increased due to expansion in assets under management.Noninterest income for 2023 reflects payout of a BOLI policy, gain on the sale of an investment in VISA Class B shares, and loss on the sale of securities.\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased slightly when compared with the second quarter of 2024, due to the FCB acquisition and positive trends in Trust income.\n\n_Noninterest Expense_\n\nNoninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased when compared with the same period of 2023, due to the FCB acquisition and a contract termination expense. During 2023, the Company reported expenses, included in professional services, associated with a proxy contest.\n\nWhen the third quarter of 2024 is compared with the second quarter of 2024, noninterest expense decreased.The majority of merger-related expenses were recorded during the second quarter.Other categories increased due to the FCB acquisition and marketing expenses to promote the acquired branches and the soon to open Roanoke branch.\n\n_Securities_\n\nMarket interest rate expectations at September 30, 2024 improved the fair value of securities when compared with June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, reflecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut in September 2024. The Company’s Asset Liability Management Committee closely monitors interest rate risk on all of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities.As of September 30, 2024, the Company has the ability to hold securities until maturity.Analysis as of September 30, 2024 did not indicate credit risk concerns with any of the Company’s securities.\n\n_Deposits_ The Company’s depositors within its market areas are diverse and include individuals, businesses and municipalities.The Company does not have any brokered deposits.Depositors are insured up to the FDIC maximum of $250 thousand.Municipal deposits, which account for approximately 22% of the Company’s deposits, have additional security from bonds pledged as collateral, in accordance with state regulation.Of the Company’s non-municipal deposits, approximately 22% are uninsured. \n\n_Liquidity_\n\nThe Company’s liquidity position remains solid.The Company maintains borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) and the Federal Reserve that provide substantial borrowing capacity.During 2023, the Company accessed short-term borrowings with the FHLB and Federal Reserve to reinforce liquidity.The advances were fully repaid due to the success of the Company’s deposit strategy.Combined with a low loan-to-deposit ratio, positive results of the latest liquidity stress testing and success of deposit marketing, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet foreseeable liquidity demands.\n\n_Loans_\n\nLoans increased from June 30, 2024, driven by growth in consumer real estate and commercial real estate loans. The Company is positioned to continue to make every loan that meets its underwriting standards.\n\n_Credit Quality_\n\nLoan metrics continue to reflect low credit risk, with low charge-off and past due levels.\n\n_Stockholders’ Equity_\n\nStockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 increased when compared with 2023 primarily due to the acquisition and improvement in the unrealized loss on securities, which is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity.Accumulated other comprehensive loss is excluded from the Bank’s regulatory capital and does not affect regulatory capital ratios.The Bank is considered well capitalized, with capital ratios substantially higher than minimum regulatory requirements, and meets all requirements for borrowing from the FHLB.\n\n**About National Bankshares**\n\nNational Bankshares, Inc., headquartered in Blacksburg, Virginia, is the parent company of The National Bank of Blacksburg, which does business as National Bank, and of National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements of National Bankshares, Inc. (“NBI”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The National Bank of Blacksburg (the\n“Bank” or “NBB”) and National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. (“NBFS”) (collectively, the “Company”), conform to accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and to general practices within the banking industry. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions\nbetween the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated. The accompanying interim period consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in\nthe opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements, have been included.\nApplication of the principles of GAAP and practices within the banking industry requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that\naffect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available\nas of the date of the financial statement; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and\njudgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of\nproducing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near\nterm relate to the determination of the allowance of credit losses on loans and acquisition accounting.\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for the full year or\nany other interim period. The interim period consolidated financial statements and financial information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\n(“2023 Form 10-K”). The Company’s significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements are disclosed in\nNote 1 of the 2023 Form 10-K. All amounts and disclosures included in this quarterly report as of December 31, 2023, were derived from the Company’s\naudited consolidated financial statements. Certain items in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nThese reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or stockholders’ equity. The Company posts all reports required to be filed under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 on its web site at www.nationalbankshares.com.\nIn addition to applying significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 of the 2023 Form 10-K, the Company implemented accounting policies\nappropriate for its merger with Frontier Community Bank (“FCB”). Business combinations are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\n805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to record at fair value on the\nacquisition date the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. To determine the fair values, the Company relies on internal or third-party valuations, such as\nappraisals, valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses, or other valuation techniques.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the Company identifies the acquirer and the closing date and applies applicable recognition principles and\nconditions. Acquisition-related costs are costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation,\nand other professional or consulting fees. Some other examples of costs to the Company include systems conversions, integration planning consultants and\nadvertising costs. The Company accounts for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received,\nwith one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities are recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP. These acquisition-related costs have\nbeen and will be included within the consolidated statements of income classified within the noninterest expenses caption.\nThe most significant assessment of fair value in the Company’s accounting for business combinations relates to the valuation of an acquired loan portfolio.\nAt acquisition, loans are classified as either (i) purchase credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) loans or (ii) non-PCD loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of\nacquisition. PCD loans are those for which there is more than insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since origination. Fair values are determined\nprimarily through a discounted cash flow approach which considers the acquired loans’ underlying characteristics, including account types, remaining terms,\nannual interest rates, interest types, timing of principal and interest payments, current market rates, and remaining balances. Estimates of fair value also include\nestimates of default, loss severity, and estimated prepayments.\nAt acquisition, an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for PCD loans is determined based upon the Company’s methodology for estimating the ACL on\nloans. This allowance is credited to the ACL on loans with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the loan on the date of the acquisition. The\ndifference between the new amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance is either a noncredit discount or premium that is amortized or accreted to\ninterest income over the remaining life of the loan. Disposals of PCD loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part\nfrom the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the loan portfolio at its carrying amount.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFor non-PCD loans, an ACL is established in a manner that is consistent with the Company’s originated loans. The ACL is determined using the Company’s\nmethodology and the related ACL for non-PCD loans is recorded through a charge to the provision for credit losses in the period in which the loans are\npurchased or acquired. The entirety of any purchase discount or premium on non-PCD loans is amortized or accreted to interest income over the remaining life\nof the loan.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the Company also identified intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets lack physical substance but have contractual or other\nlegal rights or are capable of being sold or exchanged either on their own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets are initially\nrecorded at fair value. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgment. Intangible assets that have\nfinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing. Upon acquisition of FCB, the Company recognized a core\ndeposit intangible asset, which represents the value of customer deposit relationships. Core deposit intangible assets are amortized over an estimated useful life\nof 10 years using an accelerated method which approximates the estimated attrition of the acquired deposits.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is closely monitoring risks that may impact its business, including high inflation, along with U.S. monetary policy maneuvers to reduce\ninflation. Inflation and U.S. monetary policy maneuvers to reduce it may impact the Company’s customers’ demand for banking services and ability to qualify\nfor and/or repay loans. These risks could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, credit risk, asset\nvaluations and capital position.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2023-09\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and\nprovide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, which is greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying\npretax income by the entity’s applicable statutory rate, on an annual basis. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the amount of\nincome taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received)\ndisaggregated by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Lastly, the\namendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between\ndomestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. This ASU is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however,\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” ASU 2024-03 requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements,\nspecific information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period. This includes disclosing amounts related to employee\ncompensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. In addition, public companies will need to provide qualitative description of the amounts\nremaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 is effective for public business entities for annual\nreporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Implementation of ASU 2024-03 may\nbe applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2024-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNote 2: Business Combination\nOn June 1, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of FCB, a Virginia chartered commercial bank, in accordance with the\ndefinitive merger agreement that was entered into on January 23, 2024, by and among the Company, the Bank and FCB. Upon completion of the merger, former\nFCB shareholders received a combination of the Company's common stock and cash.\nThe acquisition of FCB was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and\nconsideration paid were recorded at estimated fair value on the Acquisition Date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets was\nrecorded as provisional goodwill and represents the benefit from the transaction that is not otherwise quantifiable, including expected management and\noperational synergies and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The Company will keep the measurement of goodwill open for twelve\nmonths following the Acquisition Date in order to reflect any adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that may arise during the\nCompany’s final review procedures of any updated information. The Company does not expect that any portion of goodwill will be deductible.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the calculation of the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\nEstimated Fair Estimated Fair\nAs Recorded by Value Values as\nJune 1, 2024 FCB Adjustments Recorded by NBI\nPurchase Price Consideration:\nStock consideration(1) $ 14,299\nCash consideration (2) 2,050\nTotal purchase price consideration $ 16,349\nIdentifiable assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 8,993 $ (59) $ 8,934\nSecurities 9,325 (5) 9,320\nLoans, gross, purchased performing 115,589 (7,720) 107,869\nLoans, gross, purchased credit deteriorated 11,157 (822) 10,335\nLoans in process 539 – 539\nDeferred fees and costs on loans 34 (34) –\nAllowance for credit losses on loans (881) 881 –\nPremises and equipment 3,003 449 3,452\nCore deposit intangible – 2,100 2,100\nOther assets 4,998 966 5,964\nTotal identifiable assets acquired $ 152,757 $ (4,244) $ 148,513\nIdentifiable Liabilities\nDeposits $ 130,323 $ (606) $ 129,717\nBorrowings 5,250 (20) 5,230\nOther liabilities 1,960 131 2,091\nTotal identifiable liabilities assumed $ 137,533 $ (495) $ 137,038\nProvisional fair value of net assets acquired $ 11,475\nProvisional goodwill $ 4,874\n(1) The Company issued 464,855 shares of its common stock valued at $30.76 per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on\nMay 31, 2024, the last day of trading prior to the consummation of the acquisition.\n(2) Cash consideration was paid for shareholder elections, fractional shares and to settle outstanding vested stock options. The merger agreement\nprovided for up to 10% of consideration to be paid in cash of $14.48 per FCB common share, at the shareholders’ election. Payments for shareholder\nelections and fractional shares totaled $1,769. Outstanding and vested options were settled at the difference between $14.48 and the strike price and\ntotaled $281.\nManagement made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in accounting for the acquisition of FCB. The following is a brief description of\nthe valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company utilized a valuation\nspecialist to assist with the determination of fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\nCash and equivalents\nIncluded in cash and equivalents are an investment in time deposits of other financial institutions, valued at the present value of the expected contractual\npayments discounted at market rates for instruments with similar terms.\nSecurities\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired portfolio of debt securities was based on quoted market prices. All of the acquired portfolio was sold upon\ncompletion of the acquisition.\n12\nTable of Contents\nLoans\nThe fair valuation process identified loans with credit risk indicators that qualified for PCD status. PCD and non-PCD loans were then evaluated for credit\nrisk and other fair value indicators. Consistent with GAAP, FCB’s related allowance for credit losses on loans and deferred fees and costs were not recorded.\nCredit risk was quantified using a probability of default (“PD”)/loss given default(“LGD”) methodology from a market participant perspective and applied\nto each loan’s outstanding principal balance. PD/LGD rates were tailored to PCD or non-PCD status. Other fair value indicators were quantified using a\ndiscounted cash flow methodology, with discounts applied for current market rates, credit risk and liquidity. Cash flows were generated based upon the loans’\nunderlying characteristics and estimated prepayment speeds.\nThe following table provides information on PCD and non-PCD loans as of the Acquisition Date:\nJune 1, 2024 PCD Loans Non-PCD Loans\nNumber of loans 46 498\nFCB recorded value $ 11,157 $ 115,589\nDiscount for credit risk (295) (498)\nDiscount for non-credit factors (527) (7,222)\nFair value $ 10,335 $ 107,869\nPremises and equipment\nThe fair value of premises acquired was based on a recent third-party appraisal. Acquired equipment was based on the remaining net book value of FCB,\nwhich approximated fair value.\nCore Deposit Intangible\nCore deposit relationships provide a stable source of funds for lending and contribute to profitability. The core deposit intangible was valued using an\nincome approach focused on cost savings, which recognizes the cost savings represented by the expense of maintaining the core deposit base versus the cost of\nan alternative funding source. The valuation incorporates assumptions related to account retention, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit maintenance\ncosts and alternative funding rates.\nLeases: right of use asset, lease liability and fair value\nRight of use assets (included in other assets) and lease liabilities (included in other liabilities) for branch locations were measured at the acquisition date.\nThe fair value of leases was determined by applying a discounted cash flow methodology discounted by current lease rates within the appropriate market.\nDeposits\nDeposits were valued using methods appropriate to their characteristics. The fair value of noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand\ndeposits, money market and savings deposit accounts were assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable\non demand. Time deposits were valued at the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted at market rates for instruments with similar terms.\nBorrowings\nThe estimated fair value of borrowings was determined by obtaining payoff quotes from the lender. Borrowings were paid off upon completion of the\nacquisition.\nDeferred Tax Asset\nApplication of fair value measurements resulted in an increase to the deferred tax asset, included in other assets.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNote 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoans\nLoans as of September 30, 2024 include acquired loans at their outstanding principal balance, net of the remaining purchase discount of $7,886.

Collateral dependent loans are individually evaluated. The Company measures the ACLL\n16\nTable of Contents\non collateral dependent loans based upon the fair value of the collateral, as permitted by ASU 2016-13. Fair value of the collateral is adjusted for liquidation\ncosts/discounts. If the fair value of the collateral falls below the amortized cost of the loan, the shortfall is recognized in the ACLL. If the fair value of the\ncollateral exceeds the amortized cost, no ACLL is required.\nAs of September 30, 2024, four of the Company’s individually evaluated loans were collateral dependent. As of December 31, 2023, three of the\nCompany’s individually evaluated loans were collateral dependent. All collateral dependent loans were secured by real estate as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. The following table details the amortized cost of the collateral dependent loans as of the dates indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRelated Related\nBalance Allowance Balance Allowance\nConsumer Real Estate\nResidential closed-end first lien $ 84 $ – $ 7 $ –\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate, owner occupied 8,464 – 2,177 –\nCommercial real estate, other 880 – – –\nTotal Loans $ 9,428 $ – $ 2,184 $ –\nCredit Quality\nThe Company categorizes loans by risk based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including: collateral and financial\ninformation, historical payment experience, credit documentation and current economic trends, among other factors. At origination, each loan is assigned a risk\nrating. Ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio adjusts risk ratings on an individual loan basis to reflect updated information. Loans rated pass have acceptable\ncredit quality. Loans rated special mention have potential weakness due to challenging economic or financial conditions. Loans rated classified have well-\ndefined weaknesses that heighten the risk of default. The tables below present the loan portfolio by amortized cost basis, year of origination, loan class and\ncredit quality, and gross charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year

modifies loans for a variety of reasons. At the date of modification, the Company assesses whether the borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the loan’s risk rating is evaluated and is typically changed to special mention or classified, which\nresults in individual evaluation of the loan for the ACLL. Two loans were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the first three months\nof 2024. These loans were modified again during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was one loan to a borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulty that was modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information as of September 30, 2024 about loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nAmortized Type of\nSeptember 30, 2024 Cost Basis % of Class Modification Financial Effect\nCommercial Real Estate\n3 months of interest only payments, re-\nInterest only amortization of the balance to contractual\nCommercial real estate owner-occupied $ 6,396 4.40% payments maturity.\nCommercial Non real estate\nTerm Renewal of single-payment note for an\nCommercial and industrial $ 6 0.01% extension additional 3 months.\nThe following table presents information as of September 30, 2023 about loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nAmortized Type of\nSeptember 30, 2023 Cost Basis % of Class Modification Financial Effect\nCommercial Real Estate\n6 months of interest only payments,\nInterest only re-amortization of the balance to contractual\nCommercial real estate owner-occupied $ 6,396 5.38% payments maturity.\nThe Company closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Both loans are in current status as\nof September 30, 2024.\nThere were no loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a payment default during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default. Default is determined at 90 or more days past due, upon charge-off, or upon foreclosure.\nModified loans in default are individually evaluated for the allowance for credit losses or if the modified loan is deemed uncollectible, the loan, or a portion of\nthe loan, is written off and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly.\nConsumer Real Estate Loans In Process of Foreclosure\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had three consumer real estate loans totaling $397 in process of foreclosure. As of December 31, 2023, one\nconsumer real estate loan of $7 was in process of foreclosure.\nACL for Unfunded Commitments\nThe following tables present the balance and activity in the ACL for unfunded commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 259\nRecovery of credit losses (25)\nFCB acquisition 7\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 241\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Commitments\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ 35\nAdoption of ASU 2016-13 207\nRecovery of credit losses 21\nBalance, September 30, 2023 $ 263\n20\nTable of Contents\nNote 4: Securities\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for sale along with gross unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated are\nsummarized as follows:\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nSeptember 30, 2024 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. government agencies and corporations $ 353,077 $ - $ 32,645 $ 320,432\nStates and political subdivisions 178,270 - 25,542 152,728\nMortgage-backed securities 146,619 53 4,427 142,245\nCorporate debt securities 6,507 - 631 5,876\nU.S. treasury 999 - 9 990\nTotal securities available for sale $ 685,472 $ 53 $ 63,254 $ 622,271\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nDecember 31, 2023 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nU.S. government agencies and corporations $ 353,904 $ - $ 42,060 $ 311,844\nStates and political subdivisions 179,507 - 29,614 149,893\nMortgage-backed securities 156,875 - 6,724 150,151\nCorporate debt securities 6,504 - 754 5,750\nU.S. treasury 996 - 33 963\nTotal securities available for sale $ 697,786 $ - $ 79,185 $ 618,601\nNo allowance for credit loss on securities available for sale was recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nAccrued interest receivable on securities, included in accrued interest receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $3,379 at September 30, 2024\nand $3,281 at December 31, 2023.\nThe deferred tax asset for the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale was $13,272 as of September 30, 2024 and $16,629 as of December 31,\n2023. The deferred tax asset is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of single maturity securities available for sale at September 30, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected\nmaturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment\npenalties.

Consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the\nissuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair\nvalue.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had 563 securities with a fair value of $599,897 in an unrealized loss position. The Company reviews securities in an\nunrealized loss position to evaluate credit risk. The Company considers payment history, risk ratings from external parties, financial statements for municipal\nand corporate securities, public statements from issuers and other available credible published sources in evaluating credit risk. No credit risk was found and no\nACL on securities available for sale was recorded as of September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses are attributed to noncredit-related factors, including changes\nin interest rates and other market conditions. The Company does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuers to settle the\nsecurities at a price less than the cost basis of the investments. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing\ndate or if market yields for such investments decline.\nRestricted Stock.\nThe Company holds restricted stock that is reported separately from available for sale securities. As a member of the Federal Reserve and the Federal\nHome Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”), NBB is required to maintain certain minimum investments in the common stock of those entities. Required levels of\ninvestment are based upon NBB’s capital and a percentage of qualifying assets. The Company purchases stock from or sells stock back to the correspondents\nbased on their calculations. The stock is held by member institutions only and is not actively traded.\nRedemption of FHLB stock is subject to certain limitations and conditions. At its discretion, the FHLB may declare dividends on the stock. In addition to\ndividends, NBB also benefits from its membership with FHLB through eligibility to borrow from the FHLB, using as collateral NBB’s capital stock investment\nin the FHLB and qualifying NBB real estate mortgage loans totaling $507,498 at September 30, 2024. The Company’s management reviews for impairment\nbased upon the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLB stock, and at September 30, 2024, did not determine any impairment.\nRealized Securities Gains and Losses\nThe Company initiated sale of FCB’s securities portfolio upon completion of the acquisition, and no gain or loss was recorded. During the first nine months\nof 2023, the Company realized net securities losses of $3,332 on the sale of securities with an amortized cost basis of $46,850. The sales were part of the\nCompany’s interest rate risk management strategy.\n22\nTable of Contents\nNote 5: Defined Benefit Plan\nThe following table presents components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost for the periods indicated:\nPension Benefits\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nService cost $ 261 $ 203\nInterest cost 302 273\nExpected return on plan assets (608) (518)\nRecognized net actuarial loss 33 17\nNet periodic benefit income $ (12) $ (25)\nPension Benefits\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nService cost $ 783 $ 609\nInterest cost 906 819\nExpected return on plan assets (1,824) (1,553)\nRecognized net actuarial loss 99 52\nNet periodic benefit income $ (36) $ (73)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is included in salaries and employee benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAll other components are included in other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In April of 2024, the Company made a contribution of\n$3,000 to the defined benefit plan.\nNote 6: Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. GAAP requires that valuation\ntechniques maximize the use of the observable inputs and minimize the use of the unobservable inputs. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy which\nprioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Based on the underlying inputs, each fair value measurement in its entirety is reported in one of the three\nlevels. These levels are:\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on observable inputs including:\n• quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities,\n• quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in less active markets,\n• inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and\n• model-based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions can be derived primarily from or corroborated by observable\ndata in the market.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is based on model-based techniques that use one or more significant inputs or assumptions that are unobservable in the market.\nFair value is best determined by quoted market prices. However, in cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates\nusing present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates\nof future cash flows. Accordingly, fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Accounting guidance for fair value\nexcludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from disclosure requirements. Consequently, the aggregate fair value amounts presented\nmay not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure\ncertain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated financial statements.\n23\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nSecurities Available for Sale\nSecurities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available\n(Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for\nwhich significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources\nand may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). The carrying value of\nrestricted Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and FHLB stock approximates fair value based upon the redemption provisions of each entity and is therefore\nexcluded from the following tables. The following tables present the balances of financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates\nindicated.\nFair Value Measurement Using\nSeptember 30, 2024 Balance Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nU.S. government agencies and corporations $ 320,432 $ - $ 320,432 $ -\nStates and political subdivisions 152,728 - 152,728 -\nMortgage-backed securities 142,245 - 142,245 -\nCorporate debt securities 5,876 - 5,876 -\nU.S. treasury 990 - 990 -\nTotal securities available for sale $ 622,271 $ - $ 622,271 $ -\nFair Value Measurement Using\nDecember 31, 2023 Balance Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nU.S. government agencies and corporations $ 311,844 $ - $ 311,844 $ -\nStates and political subdivisions 149,893 - 149,893 -\nMortgage-backed securities 150,151 - 150,151 -\nCorporate debt securities 5,750 - 5,750 -\nU.S. treasury 963 - 963 -\nTotal securities available for sale $ 618,601 $ - $ 618,601 $ -\nThe Company’s securities portfolio is valued using Level 2 inputs. The Company relies on an independent third party vendor to provide market valuations.\nThe inputs used to determine value include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities,\nbids, offers and reference data including market research publications. The third party vendor also monitors market indicators, industry activity and economic\nevents as part of the valuation process. Central to the final valuation is the assumption that the indicators used are representative of the fair value of securities\nheld within the Company’s portfolio. Level 2 inputs are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty and changes in these assumptions or methodologies in the\nfuture, if any, may impact securities fair value, deferred tax assets or liabilities, or expense.\nInterest Rate Loan Contracts and Forward Sale Commitments\nThe Company originates consumer real estate loans which it intends to sell to a correspondent lender. Interest rate loan contracts and forward sale\ncommitments result from originating loans held for sale and are derivatives reported at fair value. The Company enters interest rate lock commitments with\ncustomers who apply for a loan which the Company intends to sell to a correspondent lender. The interest rate loan contract ends when the loan closes or the\ncustomer withdraws their application. Fair value of the interest rate loan contract is based upon the correspondent lender’s pricing quotes at the report date. Fair\nvalue is adjusted for the estimated probability of the loan closing with the borrower.\nAt the time the Company enters into an interest rate loan contract with a customer, it also enters into a best efforts forward sales commitment with the\ncorrespondent lender. If the loan is closed and funded, the best efforts commitment converts to a mandatory forward sales commitment. Fair value is based on\nthe gain or loss that would occur if the Company were to pair-off the transaction with the investor at the measurement date. This is a Level 3 input. The\nCompany measures and reports best efforts commitments at fair value.\nInterest rate loan contracts and forward sale commitments are valued based on quotes from the correspondent lender at the reporting date. Pricing changes\ndaily and if a loan has not been sold to the correspondent by the next reporting date, the fair value may be different from that reported currently. Changes in fair\nvalue measurement impacts net income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, three funded loans gave rise to a liability for the forward sales commitment. The Company had one rate lock commitment as of\nDecember 31, 2023, resulting in an asset for the interest rate loan contract and a liability for the forward sales commitment, and one funded loan resulting in a\nforward sales commitment. The following tables present information on the interest rate loan contracts and forward sale commitments as of the date indicated:\n24\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurement Using\nSeptember 30, 2024 Balance (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nForward sale commitment $ (3) $ - $ - $ (3)\nSeptember 30, 2024 Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range (Weighted Average)\nForward sale commitment Market approach Pull-through rate 100%(1)\nForward sale commitment Market approach Current reference price 101.99% - 102.63% (102.14) (2)\nFair Value Measurement Using\nDecember 31, 2023 Balance (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nInterest rate loan contract $ 3 $ - $ - $ 3\nForward sale commitment $ (4) $ - $ - $ (4)\nDecember 31, 2023 Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range (Weighted Average)\nInterest rate loan contract Market approach Pull-through rate 100%(1)\nForward sale commitment Market approach Pull-through rate 100%(1)\nInterest rate loan contract Market approach Current reference price 102.64%(3)\nForward sale commitment Market approach Current reference price 101.60% - 102.64% (101.98%)(2)\n(1) All contracts are valued using the same pull-through rate\n(2) Current reference prices were weighted by the relative amount of the loan\n(3) Comprised of only one loan.\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nCertain financial instruments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets\nusually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The following describes the valuation techniques\nused by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four family residential loans originated for sale in\nthe secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not\nmaterially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a\nnonrecurring basis. A liability of $3 for the fair value of loans held for sale was recorded as of September 30, 2024. No nonrecurring fair value adjustments were\nrecorded on loans held for sale at December 31, 2023.\nCollateral Dependent Loans\nCollateral dependent loans are measured on a non-recurring basis for the ACLL. If the fair value of the collateral is lower than the loan’s amortized cost\nbasis, the shortfall is recognized in the ACLL. When repayment is expected from the operation of the collateral, fair value is estimated as the present value of\nexpected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected from the sale of the collateral, fair value is estimated using measurement\ntechniques discussed below and discounted by the estimated cost to sell. The ACLL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date\nexceeds the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\nFor loans secured by real estate, fair value of collateral is determined by the “as-is” value of appraisals or third party evaluations that are less than 24\nmonths of age. Appraisals are prepared by independent, licensed appraisers. Appraisals are based upon observable market data analyzed through an income or\nsales valuation approach. Valuation falls within Level 2 categorization. The Company may further discount appraisals for marketing strategies, which results in\nLevel 3 categorization.\nThe value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal (Level 2) if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business’\nfinancial statements (Level 3) if not considered significant. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement\nbalances or aging reports (Level 3).\nAs of September 30, 2024, one consumer real estate loan totaling $84 and three commercial real estate loans totaling $9,344 were collateral dependent.\nValuation of the consumer real estate loan and two of the commercial real estate loans were based upon third party evaluations (Level 2). Valuation for one\ncommercial real estate loan was based upon an internal evaluation (Level 3). None of the measurements resulted in a specific allocation.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Summary\nThe following presents the recorded amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments as of the dates\nindicated.

Noninterest revenue streams such as service charges on deposit\naccounts, other service charges and fees, credit and debit card fees, trust income, and annuity and insurance commissions are recognized in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Topic 606 does not apply to revenue associated\nwith financial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities. In addition, certain noninterest income streams such as financial guarantees, derivatives,\nand certain credit card fees are outside the scope of the guidance. Noninterest revenue streams within the scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts consist of monthly service fees, overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees, ATM fees, wire transfer fees, and other deposit\naccount related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period\nin which the service is provided. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct\ncharge to customers’ accounts. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a\nCompany ATM. Wire transfer fees, overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees and other deposit account related fees are transactional based, and therefore, the\nCompany’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time.\nOther Service Charges and Fees\nOther service charges include safe deposit box rental fees, check ordering charges, and other service charges. Safe deposit box rental fees are charged to\nthe customer on an annual basis and recognized upon receipt of payment. The Company determined that since\n27\nTable of Contents\nrentals and renewals occur fairly consistently over time, revenue is recognized on a basis consistent with the duration of the performance obligation. Check\nordering charges are transactional based, and therefore the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time.\nCredit and Debit Card Fees\nCredit and debit card fees are primarily comprised of interchange fee income and merchant services income. Interchange fees are earned whenever the\nCompany’s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Merchant services income mainly represents\ncommission fees based upon merchant processing volume. The Company’s performance obligation for interchange fee income and merchant services income are\nlargely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the\nfollowing month. In compliance with Topic 606, credit and debit card fee income is presented net of associated expense.\nTrust Income\nTrust income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and estates and other customer assets. The\nCompany’s performance obligation is generally satisfied over time and the resulting fees are recognized monthly, based upon the month-end market value of the\nassets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received a few days after month end through a direct charge to customers’ accounts.\nThe Company does not earn performance-based incentives. Estate management fees are based upon the size of the estate. A partial fee is recognized half-way\nthrough the estate administration and the remainder of the fee is recognized when remaining assets are distributed and the estate is closed.\nInsurance and Investment\nInsurance income primarily consists of commissions received on insurance product sales. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Company’s\ncustomer and the insurance carrier. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the insurance policy. Shortly after the\ninsurance policy is issued, the carrier remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue.\nInvestment income consists of recurring revenue streams such as commissions from sales of mutual funds, annuities and other investments. Commissions\nfrom the sale of mutual funds, annuities and other investments are recognized on trade date, which is when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation.\nThe Company also receives periodic service fees (i.e., trailers) from mutual fund companies typically based on a percentage of net asset value. Trailer revenue is\nrecorded over time, usually monthly or quarterly, as net asset value is determined.\nOREO Gains and Losses\nThe Company records a gain or loss from the sale of other real estate owned (“OREO”) when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally\noccurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Company finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Company assesses whether the buyer is committed to\nperform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is\nderecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer.\nThe following presents noninterest income, segregated by revenue streams in-scope and out-of-scope of Topic 606, for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNoninterest Income 2024 2023\nIn-scope of Topic 606:\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 753 $ 642\nOther service charges and fees 82 151\nCredit and debit card fees, net 344 395\nTrust income 580 505\nInsurance and Investment (included within Other Income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income) 126 142\nNoninterest Income (in-scope of Topic 606) $ 1,885 $ 1,835\nNoninterest Income (out-of-scope of Topic 606) 387 280\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,272 $ 2,115\n28\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nNoninterest Income 2024 2023\nIn-scope of Topic 606:\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 2,150 $ 1,871\nOther service charges and fees 176 253\nCredit and debit card fees, net 1,141 1,276\nTrust income 1,596 1,431\nInsurance and Investment (included within Other Income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Income) 558 539\nNoninterest Income (in-scope of Topic 606) $ 5,621 $ 5,370\nNoninterest Income (out-of-scope of Topic 606) 1,096 1,735\nTotal noninterest income $ 6,717 $ 7,105\nNote 9: Leases\nThe Company’s leases are recorded under ASC Topic 842, “Leases”. The Company categorizes leases as short-term, operating or finance leases. Leases\nwith terms of 12 months or less are designated as short-term and are not capitalized. Operating and finance leases are capitalized as right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities. Right-of-use assets, included in other assets, represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and are calculated as the sum\nof the lease liability and if applicable, prepaid rent, initial direct costs and any incentives received from the lessor. Lease liabilities, included in other liabilities,\nrepresent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments and are presented at each reporting date as the net present value of the remaining contractual cash\nflows. Cash flows are discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate in effect at the commencement date of the lease. The Company does not separate\nnon-lease components from lease components within a single contract. Counterparties for the Company’s lease contracts are external to the Company and not\nrelated parties.\nOn June 1, 2024, the Company’s acquisition of FCB added two long-term branch leases. At the Acquisition Date, the leases were remeasured using the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate and remaining lease terms, resulting in an increase of $548 to the right of use asset and the lease liability.\nLease payments\nShort-term lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or for variable lease payments, in the period in\nwhich the obligation was incurred. Operating and finance lease payments may be fixed for the term of the lease or variable. If the escalation factor for a\nvariable lease payment is known, such as a specified percentage increase per year or a stated increase at a specified time, the variable payment is included in the\ncash flows used to determine the lease liability. If the variable payment is based upon an unknown escalator, such as the consumer price index at a future date,\nthe increase is not included in the cash flows used to determine the lease liability.\nOptions to Extend, Residual Value Guarantees, Restrictions and Covenants\nCertain of the Company’s operating leases offer the option to extend the lease term and the Company has included such extensions in its calculation of the\nlease liabilities to the extent the options are reasonably certain of being exercised. The lease agreements do not provide for residual value guarantees and have no\nrestrictions or covenants that would impact dividends or require incurring additional financial obligations.\nThe following tables present information about leases as of the dates and for the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLease liability $ 1,626 $ 1,127\nRight-of-use asset $ 1,404 $ 1,096\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 4.89 4.39\nWeighted average discount rate 3.85% 3.29%\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nLease Expense 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 127 $ 91\nShort-term lease expense 5 10\nTotal lease expense $ 132 $ 101\nCash paid for amounts included in lease liabilities $ 131 $ 100\n29\nTable of Contents\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\nLease Expense 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 315 $ 275\nShort-term lease expense 16 11\nTotal lease expense $ 331 $ 286\nCash paid for amounts included in lease liabilities $ 330 $ 286\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities commencing\nduring the period $ 548 $ –\nThe following table presents a maturity schedule of undiscounted cash flows that contribute to the lease liability:\nAs of\nUndiscounted Cash Flow for the Period September 30, 2024\nTwelve months ending September 30, 2025 $ 397\nTwelve months ending September 30, 2026 352\nTwelve months ending September 30, 2027 303\nTwelve months ending September 30, 2028 304\nTwelve months ending September 30, 2029 178\nThereafter 239\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 1,773\nLess: discount (147)\nLease liability $ 1,626\nNote 10: Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company’s 2023 Stock Incentive Plan (“the Plan”) was approved by shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting on May 9, 2023. The Plan\nprovides for the grant of various forms of stock-based compensation awards that may be settled in, or based upon the value of, the Company’s common stock.\nThe maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Plan is 120,000 shares. For further information on the Plan, refer to the Company’s Proxy\nStatement filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 and the Company’s S-8 filed with the SEC on June 7, 2023.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nUnder the Plan, non-employee directors receive restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) each June and December. The RSAs are valued at the closing stock price\non the grant date and expensed over the one-year vesting period. Stock based compensation expense charged against income was $28 and $93 for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, expense of $61 related to the nonvested RSAs is expected to be recognized over the coming\n12 months.

(\"NBFS\"). NBB is a\ncommunity bank and does business as National Bank from 27 office locations and two loan production offices. NBB is the source of nearly all of the Company’s\nrevenue. NBFS does business as National Bankshares Investment Services and National Bankshares Insurance Services. Income from NBFS is not significant at\nthis time, nor is it expected to be so in the near future.\nThe Company expects construction of a new branch in Roanoke, Virginia to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. The full service branch will\nexpand our already successful loan production office and enhance our business opportunities in the Roanoke Valley.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within our statements is, to a\nsignificant extent, based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate\nvalue obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. Although the economics of the Company’s transactions\nmay not change, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change.\nCritical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition or results of operations and require management’s\nmost difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If conditions occur that differ from our assumptions, depending\nupon the severity of such differences, the Company’s financial condition or results of operations may be materially impacted. The Company has designated the\nfollowing policies as critical: those governing the allowance for credit losses, goodwill, the pension plan, core deposit intangibles and loans acquired in a\nbusiness combination. The Company evaluates its critical accounting estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and updates them as needed. For\ninformation on the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and the pension plan, please refer to the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K, Note 1: Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies. For information on policies governing core deposit intangibles and loans acquired in a business combination, please refer to Note 1:\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q report.\nAcquisition of Frontier Community Bank\nOn June 1, 2024, the Company and the Bank acquired FCB, a Virginia chartered commercial bank headquartered in Waynesboro, Virginia.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and to enhance investors’ overall\nunderstanding of such financial performance. The methodology for determining these non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. Non-GAAP\nmeasures are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Details on non-GAAP\nmeasures follow.\n33\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Margin\nThe Company uses the net interest margin to measure profit on interest generating activities, as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The\nCompany’s net interest margin is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis. The portion of interest income that is nontaxable is grossed up to the\ntax equivalent by adding the tax benefit based on a tax rate of 21%. Annualized FTE net interest income is divided by total average earning assets to calculate the\nnet interest margin. The following tables present the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest\nincome, for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNet Interest Margin, FTE 2024 2023\nInterest income (GAAP) $ 18,666 $ 14,679\nAdd: FTE adjustment 241 229\nInterest income, FTE (non-GAAP) 18,907 14,908\nInterest expense (GAAP) 9,218 6,039\nNet interest income, FTE (non-GAAP) $ 9,689 $ 8,869\nAverage balance of interest-earning assets $ 1,754,031 $ 1,581,042\nNet interest margin 2.20% 2.23%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nNet Interest Margin, FTE 2024 2023\nInterest income (GAAP) $ 51,805 $ 43,320\nAdd: FTE adjustment 729 648\nInterest income, FTE (non-GAAP) 52,534 43,968\nInterest expense (GAAP) 25,412 14,517\nNet interest income, FTE (non-GAAP) $ 27,122 $ 29,451\nAverage balance of interest-earning assets $ 1,694,186 $ 1,605,202\nNet interest margin 2.14% 2.45%\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of FTE net interest income and noninterest income, excluding certain items\nthe Company’s management deems unusual or non-recurring. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with\nimportant information regarding operational efficiency.

However, the Company expects the interest\nrate cut to benefit deposit costs during the fourth quarter of 2024. While the interest rate cut is expected to reduce deposit costs, current interest rates are still at a\nlevel that will allow interest income and the yield on earning assets to grow as adjustable loans reach repricing dates.\nNoninterest Income\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Percent Change\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 753 $ 642 17.29%\nOther service charges and fees 82 151 (45.70)%\nCredit and debit card fees, net 344 395 (12.91)%\nTrust income 580 505 14.85%\nBOLI income 295 253 16.60%\nGain on sale of mortgage loans 50 22 127.27%\nOther income 168 147 14.29%\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,272 $ 2,115 7.42%\n38\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Percent Change\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 2,150 $ 1,871 14.91%\nOther service charges and fees 176 253 (30.43)%\nCredit and debit card fees, net 1,141 1,276 (10.58)%\nTrust income 1,596 1,431 11.53%\nBOLI income 822 1,771 (53.59)%\nGain on sale of investment – 2,971 NM\nGain on sale of mortgage loans 132 93 41.94%\nOther income 700 771 (9.21)%\nRealized securities loss, net – (3,332) NM\nTotal noninterest income $ 6,717 $ 7,105 (5.46)%\nService charges on deposit accounts increased when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared with the comparable periods of\n2023, due to changes in fee structure.

Key\nnoninterest expense changes include occupancy, furniture and fixtures, professional services, merger-related expenses, and contract termination expenses.\nOccupancy, furniture and fixtures expense increased when compared with 2023 due to the addition of assets acquired in the FCB merger and the receipt of\na one-time insurance reimbursement during 2023.\nProfessional services include legal and other expenses for the Company’s response to a proxy contest from an activist shareholder during 2023, which\namounted to $786 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded expenses associated with its acquisition of FCB, including executive and employee severance benefits and legal and\nconsulting fees.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a contract termination expense when it gave formal notification to a vendor that it intends to end\nits relationship in 2025.\nIncluded in various categories of noninterest expense are expenses to manage cybersecurity risk. The cost of these measures was $92 for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and $141 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total cybersecurity\nexpense was $276 compared to $424 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company places high priority on cybersecurity. The decrease in\nexpense reflects renegotiation of contracts and licensing.\nIncome Tax\nThe Company’s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $550. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded an income tax expense of $617. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s income tax expense was $891 and effective\ntax rate was 16.39%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s income tax expense was $2,105 and effective tax rate was 15.47%. A\nsignificant portion of the merger related expense was not tax deductible, resulting in an increase to the Company’s effective tax rate for 2024. During 2023, the\nCompany recognized a gain on the settlement of a BOLI policy that was not taxable.\nAsset Quality\nKey indicators of the Company’s asset quality are presented in the following table.\nSeptember 30, September 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nNonaccrual loans $ 2,283 $ 2,981 $ 2,629\nLoans past due 90 days or more, and still accruing 71 31 188\nOther real estate owned – 662 –\nACLL to loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs 1.03% 1.20% 1.06%\nNet charge-off ratio 0.04% – 0.02%\nRatio of nonperforming assets to loans, net of unearned income and\ndeferred fees and costs, plus other real estate owned 0.23% 0.43% 0.31%\nRatio of ACLL to nonperforming loans 452.39% 341.53% 345.91%\nFor information on the Company’s policies on the ACLL, please refer to the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K, Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\nThe Company’s risk analysis as of September 30, 2024 determined an ACLL of $10,328, or 1.03% of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and\ncosts. This compares with an allowance of $9,094 as of December 31, 2023, or 1.06% of loans. To determine the\n40\nTable of Contents\nappropriate level of the ACLL, the Company considers credit risk for individually evaluated loans and for groups of loans evaluated collectively.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nIndividually evaluated loans were $10,713 as of September 30, 2024, a slight increase from $10,544 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024,\nfour individually evaluated loans were collateral dependent but were adequately collateralized and did not result in an individual allocation. The remaining\nindividually evaluated loans were measured using the discounted cash flow method, resulting in an allocation of $85.\nCollectively Evaluated Loans\nCollectively evaluated loans totaled $991,528, with an ACLL of $10,243 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, collectively evaluated loans\ntotaled $846,631, with an allowance of $8,522.\nCollectively evaluated loans are divided into classes based upon risk characteristics. Utilizing historical loss information and peer data, the Company\ncalculates probability of default and loss given default for each class, which is adjusted for a reasonable and supportable forecast. Cash flow projections based on\neach loan’s contractual terms are modified by the adjusted probability of default and loss given default for its class. Loan classes are allocated additional loss\nestimates based upon the Company’s analysis of qualitative factors including economic measures, asset quality indicators, loan characteristics, and changes to\ninternal Company policies and management.\nReasonable and Supportable Forecast\nThe Company applies national unemployment forecasts to project cash flows. The Company determined that 12 months represents a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period as of September 30, 2024, and set a period of 12 months to revert to historical losses on a straight-line basis. The forecast applied as\nof September 30, 2024 projects that unemployment will rise over the next 12 months to a higher level than the forecast applied as of December 31, 2023. The\nhigher unemployment forecast increased the required level of the ACLL when September 30, 2024 is compared with December 31, 2023.\nQualitative Factors: Economic\nThe Company sources economic data pertinent to its market from the most recently available publications, including business and personal bankruptcy\nfilings, the residential vacancy rate and the inventory of new and existing homes.\nHigher bankruptcy filings indicate heightened credit risk and increase the ACLL, while lower bankruptcy filings have a beneficial impact on credit risk.\nCompared with data available as of December 31, 2023, business and personal bankruptcies filings increased slightly.\nResidential vacancy rates and housing inventory impact the Company’s residential construction customers and the consumer real estate market. Higher\nlevels increase credit risk. The residential vacancy rate available as of September 30, 2024 increased from the data incorporated into the December 31, 2023\ncalculation. Housing data available as of September 30, 2024 showed higher inventory than as of December 31, 2023, resulting in a higher allocation.\nQualitative Factors: Asset Quality Indicators\nAccruing past due loans are analyzed at the class level and compared with previous levels. Increases in past due loans indicate heightened credit risk.\nAccruing loans past due 30-89 days were 0.33% of total loans as of September 30, 2024, an increase from 0.19% as of December 31, 2023.\nQualitative Factors: Other Considerations\nThe Company considers other factors that impact credit risk, including the interest rate environment, the competitive, legal and regulatory environments,\nchanges in lending policies and loan review, changes in lending management, and high risk loans.\nThe interest rate environment impacts variable rate loans. The Federal Reserve’s substantial interest rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023\nhave increased and are expected to continue to increase payments on the Company’s variable rate loans as they reach contractual repricing dates, despite the\nFederal Reserve's recent reduction in their target rate. The Company allocates additional reserve each time the Federal Reserve increases rates, under the\nexpectation that higher payments may increase credit risk. After the rate increase has been in effect for one year, the allocation may be removed if management\ndeems that the impact of the change has become integrated to the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reduced its allocation from December 31,\n2023 .\nThe competitive, legal and regulatory environments were evaluated for changes that would affect credit risk. Higher competition for loans increases credit\nrisk, while lower competition decreases credit risk. Competition remained at similar levels to those at December 31, 2023. The legal and regulatory\nenvironments also remain in a similar posture to December 31, 2023.\nLending policies, loan review procedures and management’s experience influence credit risk. Policies and procedures remain similar to those at December\n31, 2023. The Company added an allocation to account for absorption of FCB acquired loans and integration of FCB lenders.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLevels of high risk loans are considered in the determination of the level of the ACLL. A decrease in the level of high risk loans within a class decreases the\nrequired allocation for the loan class, and an increase in the level of high risk loans within a class increases the required allocation for the loan class. Total high\nrisk loans increased from the level at December 31, 2023.\nUnallocated Surplus\nThe unallocated surplus as of September 30, 2024 is $83, or 0.81% in excess of the calculated requirement. The unallocated surplus at December 31, 2023\nwas $350, or 4.00% in excess of the calculated requirement. The surplus provides some mitigation of current economic uncertainty that may impact credit risk.\nConclusion\nThe calculation of the appropriate level for the ACLL incorporates analysis of multiple factors and requires management’s prudent and informed judgment.\nThe Company augmented the calculated requirement with an unallocated surplus. Based on analysis of historical indicators, asset quality and economic factors,\nmanagement believes the level of ACLL is reasonable for the credit risk in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024.\nACL on Unfunded Commitments\nThe ACL on unfunded commitments was $241, or 0.14% of unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024. The ACL on unfunded commitments was\n$259, or 0.16% as of December 31, 2023.\nProvision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses represents charges to earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance. The adequacy of the ACLL is reviewed\nquarterly and adjustments are made as determined necessary. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $5 and a recovery of credit losses\non unfunded commitments of $10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a recovery of credit losses on loans of $401 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and a provision of $30 for unfunded commitments.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of $1,312 and a recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments of $25 for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared with a recovery of credit losses on loans of $389 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a provision of\n$21 for unfunded commitments. Upon acquisition of FCB in June 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1,290 to establish an allowance\non non-PCD loans.\nLoan Modifications\nIn the ordinary course of business the Company modifies loan terms on a case-by-case basis for a variety of reasons. Modifications may include rate\nreductions, payment extensions of varying lengths of time, a change in amortization term or method or other arrangements. Modifications to consumer loans\ngenerally involve short-term payment extensions to accommodate specific, temporary circumstances. Modifications to commercial loans may include, but are\nnot limited to, changes in interest rate, maturity, amortization and financial covenants.\nThe Company reviews modifications to determine whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including indicators of default, bankruptcy,\ngoing concern, insufficient projected cash flows and inability to obtain financing from other sources. If a modification is made to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, the loan’s risk rating is downgraded to special mention or classified, resulting in individual evaluation for the ACLL. Please refer to Note 3:\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nModifications for Borrowers Who Were Not Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company modified loans in the normal course of business for borrowers who\nwere not experiencing financial difficulty. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified 205 loans totaling $42,969. During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified 637 loans totaling $86,905. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nprovided 186 modifications to loans totaling $23,054. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company provided 581 modifications to loans totaling\n$65,089.\nKey Assets and Liabilities\nNBI’s key assets and liabilities and their change from December 31, 2023 are shown in the following table.\n42\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, December 31, Percent\n2024 2023 Change\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 33,707 $ 73,636 (54.22)%\nSecurities available for sale, at fair value and restricted stock 624,120 619,865 0.69%\nLoans, net 991,331 847,552 16.96%\nTotal assets 1,785,033 1,655,370 7.83%\nDeposits 1,602,953 1,503,972 6.58%\nAverage Balances\nYear-to-date daily averages for the major balance sheet categories are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31, Percent\nAssets 2024 2023 Change\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 80,637 $ 37,660 114.12%\nSecurities available for sale, at fair value and restricted stock 611,037 620,535 (1.53)%\nLoans, net 909,345 840,590 8.18%\nTotal assets 1,726,898 1,613,854 7.00%\nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 286,643 $ 299,748 (4.37)%\nInterest-bearing demand deposits 839,211 826,112 1.59%\nSavings deposits 175,670 195,592 (10.19)%\nTime deposits 268,313 150,395 78.41%\nStockholders’ equity 143,444 124,641 15.09%\nIncreased customer deposits resulted in increased investment in interest bearing deposit assets.

The Company paid dividends to shareholders in June 2024.\nThe Company qualifies as a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which exempts\nbank holding companies with less than $3 billion in assets from reporting consolidated regulatory capital ratios and from minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements. NBB is subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies, including an additional capital conservation buffer in order to\nmake capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated in compliance with OCC rules based on the Basel III Capital\nRules. The Bank’s ratios are well above the required minimums as of September 30, 2024. Capital ratios for NBB are shown in the following tables.\nRegulatory\nCapital\nRegulatory Minimum Ratios\nCapital with Capital\nMinimum Conservation\nNBB Ratios Buffer\nCommon Equity Tier I Capital Ratio 16.55% 4.50% 7.00%\nTier I Capital Ratio 16.55% 6.00% 8.50%\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.40% 8.00% 10.50%\nLeverage Ratio 11.08% 4.00% 4.00%\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures the Company’s ability to meet its financial commitments at a reasonable cost. Demands on the Company’s liquidity include funding\nadditional loan demand and accepting withdrawals of existing deposits. The Company has diverse liquidity sources, including customer and purchased deposits,\ncustomer repayments of loan principal and interest, sales, calls and maturities of securities, Federal Reserve discount window borrowing, short-term borrowing,\nand FHLB advances.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $293,379 of borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Company had $178,582 of unused capacity at the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount window. Periodically during 2023, the Company accessed FHLB borrowings. The advances were fully repaid, due to the\nsuccess of the Company’s deposit strategy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have purchased deposits, discount window borrowings or short-term\nborrowings.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe Company considers its security portfolio for typical liquidity needs, within accounting, legal and strategic parameters. Portions of the securities\nportfolio are pledged to meet state requirements for public funds deposits. Discount window borrowings also require pledged securities. Increased/decreased\nliquidity from public funds deposits or discount window borrowings results in increased/decreased liquidity from pledging requirements. The Company monitors\npublic funds pledging requirements and unpledged available for sale securities accessible for liquidity needs.\nRegulatory capital levels determine the Company’s ability to use purchased deposits and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company is considered well capitalized and does not have any restrictions on purchased deposits or borrowing ability at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window.\nThe Company monitors factors that may increase its liquidity needs. Some of these factors include deposit trends, large depositor activity, maturing deposit\npromotions, interest rate sensitivity, maturity and repricing timing gaps between assets and liabilities, the level of unfunded loan commitments and loan growth.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s liquidity is sufficient to meet projected trends.\nTo monitor and estimate liquidity levels, the Company performs stress testing under varying assumptions on credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and\namounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows. The Company’s Contingency Funding Plan sets forth avenues for rectifying\nliquidity shortfalls. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated adequate liquidity under the tested scenarios.\nThe Company utilizes several other strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity. Loan and deposit growth are managed to keep the loan to deposit ratio within\nthe Company’s internally-set target range. As of September 30, 2024, the loan to deposit ratio was 62.49%. The investment strategy takes into consideration the\nterm of the investment, and securities in the available for sale portfolio are laddered based upon projected funding needs.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, NBB extends lines of credit and letters of credit to its customers. Depending on their needs, customers may draw upon\nlines of credit at any time in any amount up to a pre-approved limit. Financial letters of credit guarantee payments to facilitate customer purchases. Performance\nletters of credit guarantee payment if the customer fails to complete a specific obligation.\nWhile it would be possible for customers to fully draw on approved lines of credit and for beneficiaries to call all letters of credit, historically this has not\noccurred. In the event of a sudden and substantial draw on these lines, the Company would be able to access multiple options, including its lines of credit with\ncorrespondents, raising additional deposits, or selling securities available for sale or loans. The Company estimates an ACL on unfunded loan commitments\nunder the current expected credit losses model.\nThe Company sells mortgages on the secondary market. Our agreement with the purchaser provides for strict underwriting and documentation\nrequirements. Violation of the representations and warranties of the agreement would entitle the purchaser to recourse provisions. The Company has determined\nthat its risk in this area is not significant because of the low volume of secondary market mortgage loans and high underwriting standards. The Company\nestimates a potential loss reserve for recourse provisions that is not material as of September 30, 2024. To date, no recourse provisions have been invoked. If\nfunds were needed, the Company would access the same sources as noted above for funding lines and letters of credit. There were no material changes in off-\nbalance sheet arrangements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company had no finance lease or purchase obligations and no long-term debt at September 30, 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness\nof the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has excluded the operations of FCB as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (not to extend more than one year beyond the date of the acquisition or for more than one annual reporting period). The\nmerger was completed on June 1, 2024. See \"Note 2. Business Combinations\" for further discussion of the merger and its impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBased on that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time\n45\nTable of Contents\nperiods specified by the Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, the Company believes that no system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected.\nPart II\nOther Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThere are no pending or threatened legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which the property of the Company or\nany of its subsidiaries is subject that, in the opinion of management, may materially impact the financial condition of the Company.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nPlease refer to the “Risk Factors” previously disclosed in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and the factors discussed under “Cautionary Statement Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” in Part I.

These factors include, but are not limited to, effects of or changes in interest rates, the ability to\nmaintain adequate liquidity by retaining deposit customers and secondary funding sources, especially if the Company’s or banking industry’s reputation becomes\ndamaged, the adequacy of the level of the Company’s allowance for credit losses, the amount of credit loss provisions required in future periods, and the failure of\nassumptions underlying the allowance for credit losses, general and local economic conditions, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies\nof the U.S. Treasury, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB and the FDIC, and the impact of any policies or programs implemented pursuant to financial reform\nlegislation, unanticipated increases in the level of unemployment in the Company’s market, the quality or composition of the loan and/or investment portfolios,\ndemand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in the Company’s market, the real estate market in the Company’s market, laws,\nregulations and policies impacting financial institutions, technological risks and developments, and cyber-threats, attacks or events, the Company’s technology\ninitiatives, geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, or actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response to acts\nor threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, the occurrence of significant natural disasters, including severe weather conditions, floods, health related issues, and\nother catastrophic events, the Company's ability to identify, attract, and retain experienced management, relationship managers, and support personnel, particularly\nin a competitive labor environment, performance by the Company’s counterparties or vendors, applicable accounting principles, policies and guidelines, and risks\nassociated with mergers, acquisitions, and other expansion activities.\nOn January 23, 2024, the Company and our bank subsidiary entered into a merger agreement with Frontier Community Bank (“Frontier”), pursuant to which the\nCompany will acquire Frontier (the “Merger”). In addition to the factors described above, the Company’s operations, performance, business strategy and results may\nbe affected by the following factors: the businesses of the Company and Frontier may not be integrated successfully after the Merger or such integration may be more\ndifficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the cost savings and synergies contemplated by the Merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected\ntimeframe; revenues following the Merger may be lower than expected; customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the\nMerger; and the ability to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals and meet other closing conditions to the Merger; and the ability to complete the\nMerger on the expected timeframe may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected.\nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation. We caution readers not to place\nundue reliance on those statements, which speak only as of the date of this presentation.\n2\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”). The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance. These measures typically\nadjust GAAP performance measures to exclude intangibles and include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income\navailable to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that are infrequent in nature. Management believes presentations of these non-\nGAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s core\nbusinesses. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\n3\nQ1 2024 Highlights\nEPS ROAA ROATCE Efficiency Ratio\n$0.37 0.53% 6.72% 72.62%\nUNADJUSTED(1)\n$0.45 0.64% 8.19% 68.10%\nCORE(1)\n✓Reported net income for the quarter of $2.17 million or $0.37 per common share and core net income of $2.65 million\nor $0.45 per common share(1)\n✓Earnings continue to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates and elevated deposit costs; however, asset\nrepricing should continue to contribute to improved interest income going forward\n✓Strong liquidity, with only 21% uninsured non-municipal deposits\n✓Substantial borrowing capacity from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve and another correspondent bank which enable the\nCompany to meet foreseeable liquidity demands\n✓Improved deposit levels due to increases in time, interest-bearing demand and noninterest-bearing deposits\n✓Modest increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss compared to Q4 2023 due to slight increase in interest\nrates over the period\nSource: Company filings; (1) Unadjusted figures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
