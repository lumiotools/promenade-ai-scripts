The Baja Project is situated on the Tijuana Ensenada corridor, 60 minutes from the Tijuana/San Diego border and a few minutes from the beaches of Ensenada, Tijuana and Rosarito.\n\nThe Baja Project expands Murano’s development pipeline and represents a major enhancement of the project, which plans already included the development of a 370 key all-inclusive hotel and an industrial park. With this addition, the property would be meaningfully enhanced with the cruise port destination, another hotel of up to 400 keys and a retail village to serve the tourist traffic that would be generated through the cruise port. While the cruise port plan is at an early stage, and there can be no certainty that the development progresses, this MOU marks a significant milestone for Murano as it builds out its pipeline.\n\nElias Sacal, CEO of Murano commented, “We are delighted to have engaged with a world leader in the cruise lines industry, as we seek to create a new major tourist destination with the proposed cruise port in our Baja Project. Importantly, there are no other cruise ports in proximity to our location. This would make the development of a port a highly strategic and mutually beneficial endeavor for Murano, the cruise operator and the local economy, which would benefit significantly from enhanced tourism. We strongly believe that Murano has the vision, know-how and experience to launch major developments and create world-class destinations, and that this development will again demonstrate these capabilities.”\n\nMurano believes that its Baja Project has several unique features which make it an attractive development opportunity. With its strategic location, modern infrastructure, and skilled workforce, Baja Park is poised to become a hub for manufacturing and logistics in the region. Ensenada is strategically located on the west coast of Mexico, with easy access to the United States and the Pacific Rim.\n\n**About Murano Global Investments**\n\nMurano Global Investments (Nasdaq: MRNO) is a London-headquartered real estate company that owns, develops and invests in hotel, resort and commercial properties throughout Mexico.

(NASDAQ: MRNO), a London-headquartered real estate company that owns, develops and invests in hotel, resort and commercial properties, announced today that it will ring the NASDAQ opening bell on Friday, April 5, 2024 in celebration of its recent public listing and the grand opening of its latest resort development, the Hyatt Vivid Grand Island in Cancun, Mexico. The grand opening marks the launch of Hyatt’s newest all-inclusive adults-only brand focused on creating a relaxed, no-pressure atmosphere in one of Mexico’s top tourist destinations.\n\n“The opening of the Hyatt Vivid Grand Island marks our second major milestone in the last two weeks, following our public listing on the NASDAQ late last month,” said Elias Sacal, CEO of Murano. “The resort represents exactly the type of high-profile, premium-branded lifestyle resort that we intend to continue developing in key markets. Our strategic decision to list on the NASDAQ was driven by our ambitious strategic growth priorities, which we anticipate will be fueled by the enhanced access to capital markets that comes with being a U.S.-listed public company. Today, we believe that Murano is an attractive partner to global hospitality brands, and we look forward to adding to and advancing our promising development pipeline.”\n\nThe 400-suite Hyatt Vivid Grand Island offers a relaxing and engaging escape with an approachable atmosphere that caters to the next generation of all-inclusive travelers. The resort features modern suites ranging from 570 to over 3,000 square feet with a neutral color palette and pop of artistic detail such as handmade ceramics. It is home to six bars serving top-shelf and zero-proof beverage options for guests to enjoy, as well as 11 casual dining options including five à la carte restaurants and an all-day eatery featuring global cuisine, all touting healthy menu options and addressing an array of dietary concerns.\n\nThe Vivid brand prioritizes simple pleasures, offering a range of engaging activities and entertainment along with a variety of water features across three pools, including a multi-tiered pool deck replete with a swim-up bar, food truck and snack bar and the longest rooftop pool in Cancun, spanning 295 square feet featuring 360-degree breathtaking views. Guests also have access to the Ennea Beach Club, a private, boho-chic beach club including two pools, beachside snack bar and guest-only restaurant. The Vivid opening marks the first phase of development on this site, with Murano and Hyatt slated to open the Hyatt Dreams Grand Island later this year.\n\n“It is our track record of successfully navigating Mexico’s nuanced real estate market and delivering high-quality hospitality product that gives leading brands the confidence to partner with us to advance their growth strategies,” said Marcos Sacal, COO of Murano. “In this case, Hyatt trusted us with the critical launch of a new brand, and we have been gratified to see the strong and growing early demand for this differentiated offering. While we are a newly public company, we have a long history of sourcing, financing and developing large-scale real estate projects on time and on budget. Our operating assets have strong revenue profiles, and with access to the public capital markets, we are well positioned to execute on our growth objectives and expand brand relationships on our current and future projects.”\n\n**About Murano Global Investments** Murano Global Investments Plc.
