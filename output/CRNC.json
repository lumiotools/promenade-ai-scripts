Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words “believes,” “plans,” “goal,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “expects,” “intends,” “continues,” “will,” “may,” or “estimates” or similar expressions) should also be considered to be forward-looking statements. Although we believe forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results or performance of the company to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements including but not limited to: the highly competitive and rapidly changing market in which we operate; adverse conditions in the automotive industry, the related supply chain and semiconductor shortage, or the global economy more generally; automotive production delays; changes in customer forecasts; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our and our customers’ businesses; the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; our inability to control and successfully manage our expenses and cash position; our inability to deliver improved financial results from process optimization efforts and cost reduction actions; escalating pricing pressures from our customers; the impact on our business of the transition to a lower level of fixed contracts, including the failure to achieve such a transition; our failure to win, renew or implement service contracts; the cancellation or postponement of existing contracts; the loss of business from any of our largest customers; effects of customer defaults; our inability to successfully introduce new products, applications and services; our strategies to increase cloud offerings and deploy generative AI and large language models (LLMs); the inability to expand into adjacent markets; the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel; disruptions arising from transitions in management personnel, including the transition to our new Chief Executive Officer; cybersecurity and data privacy incidents; fluctuating currency rates and interest rates; inflation; restrictions on our current and future operations under the terms of our debt, the use of cash to service our debt; and our inability to generate sufficient cash from our operations; and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this document.\n\n**Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** We believe that providing the non-GAAP information in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows investors to view the financial results in the way management views the operating results. We further believe that providing this information allows investors to not only better understand our financial performance, but more importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. The non-GAAP information should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of the business, for making operating decisions and for forecasting and planning for future periods. While our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance their understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, our management does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial statements.\n\nConsistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial statements, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In assessing the overall health of the business during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our management has either included or excluded the following items in general categories, each of which is described below.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA._ Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Cerence Inc. before net income (loss) attributable to income tax (benefit) expense, other income (expense) items, net, depreciation and amortization expense, and excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and restructuring and other costs, net or impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets, if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Other income (expense) items, net include interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net (as stated in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations). Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our operating performance. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs.\n\n_Restructuring and other costs, net._ Restructuring and other costs, net include restructuring expenses as well as other charges that are unusual in nature, are the result of unplanned events, and arise outside the ordinary course of our business such as employee severance costs, consulting costs relating to our transformation initiatives, costs for consolidating duplicate facilities, third-party fees relating to the modification of our convertible debt, and the release of a pre-acquisition contingency.\n\n_Amortization of acquired intangible assets._ We exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP expense and income measures. These amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Providing a supplemental measure which excludes these charges allows management and investors to evaluate results “as-if” the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired and, therefore, provides a supplemental measure of performance in which our acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to our internally developed intellectual property. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\n\n_Non-cash expenses._ We provide non-GAAP information relative to the following non-cash expenses: (i) stock-based compensation; and (ii) non-cash interest. These items are further discussed as follows:\n\ni)| Stock-based compensation. Because of varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, we exclude stock-based compensation from our operating results. We evaluate performance both with and without these measures because compensation expense related to stock-based compensation is typically non-cash and awards granted are influenced by the Company’s stock price and other factors such as volatility that are beyond our control. The expense related to stock-based awards is generally not controllable in the short-term and can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. As such, we do not include such charges in operating plans. Stock-based compensation will continue in future periods.  \n---|---  \nii)| Non-cash interest. We exclude non-cash interest because we believe that excluding this expense provides management, as well as other users of the financial statements, with a valuable perspective on the cash-based performance and health of the business, including the current near-term projected liquidity. Non-cash interest expense will continue in future periods.  \n  \n_Other expenses._ We exclude certain other expenses that result from unplanned events outside the ordinary course of continuing operations, in order to measure operating performance and current and future liquidity both with and without these expenses. By providing this information, we believe management and the users of the financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider to be our organic, continuing operations. Included in these expenses are items such as other charges (credits), net, losses from extinguishment of debt, and changes in indemnification assets corresponding with the release of pre-spin liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\n\n_Adjustments to income tax provision._ Adjustments to our GAAP income tax provision to arrive at non-GAAP net income is determined based on our non-GAAP pre-tax income. Additionally, as our non-GAAP profitability is higher based on the non-GAAP adjustments, we adjust the GAAP tax provision to remove valuation allowances and related effects based on the higher level of reported non-GAAP profitability. We also exclude from our non-GAAP tax provision certain discrete tax items as they occur.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators**\n\nWe believe that providing key performance indicators (“KPIs”) allows investors to gain insight into the way management views the performance of the business. We further believe that providing KPIs allows investors to better understand information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. KPIs should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, operating results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In assessing the performance of the business during the three months ended September 30, 2024, our management has reviewed the following KPIs, each of which is described below:\n\n  * _Percent of worldwide auto production with Cerence Technology:_ The number of Cerence enabled cars shipped as compared to IHS Markit car production data.\n  * _Change in number of Cerence connected cars shipped:_ The year-over-year change in the number of cars shipped with Cerence connected solutions. Amounts calculated on a TTM basis.\n  * _Change in Adjusted total billings YoY (TTM):_ The year over year change in total billings excluding Professional Services, prepay billings and adjusted for prepay consumption. \n\n\n\n____________\n\nSee the tables at the end of this press release for non-GAAP reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nTo learn more about Cerence, visit [www.cerence.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Gu3fC_WNASItvf7lJvvxtczORRqnQ2mncjfbBNV9GgGvMcluJX5ZMX1XzQVnr1XVKgMVfzb0pxP1GTDIhYMGqw==), and follow the company on [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qOjghQgxbH4Zj-ZtpWaNv2ygD4Il-P4sUKkCo7csdU_2TIfCm-W7skBN5342w_aebBxcfVrZs0Fk_3lyYvfUX3yRIfx5ISuIjjOe_rdhqCM=).\n\n**About Cerence Inc.** Cerence (NASDAQ: CRNC) is the global industry leader in creating unique, moving experiences for the mobility world.

This new SLM is available within the existing Cerence solutions portfolio and will power its next-generation AI assistant platform, enabling an intelligent, seamless user experience regardless of connectivity. Developed and optimized in partnership with Microsoft, CaLLM Edge is available directly to Cerence’s automaker customers as well as in the [Microsoft Azure AI model catalog](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=byJjVui4O_7r4_JlNkEYx3GMGFEG-Pe2v3U8agOjzkg6LVkcldlR2zDAtFVl1g9eFglrP81zGIlDHIjLWehyK6GXgGYqrxmn-eDG6dnq-kc=).\n\nCaLLM (Cerence Automotive Large Language Model) Edge is fine-tuned on Microsoft’s Phi-3 family of small language models, using Cerence’s extensive automotive dataset to deliver highly specialized AI that can handle a variety of automotive use cases. With 3.8 billion parameters, 4k context size, and 4-bit quantization, this model fits comfortably when embedded in the automotive headunit. Its core capabilities include implicit and explicit car control commands (for example, temperature, windows and doors, seat position) and point-of-interest search and navigation, as well as conversational interaction like, “What's the most popular movie ever shot in Hollywood?” followed by “Can you tell me more about the plot?”\n\nCompatible with major automotive platforms, CaLLM Edge is available in both embedded-only deployments, meaning it can function independently without any connectivity, as well as hybrid or cloud-first deployments in which the SLM serves as one method of answering queries and as backup when connectivity is lost. For users, this means always-on access to key generative AI-style features and information, even when not connected to the cloud, as well as improved data privacy, with data staying on board in the car rather than being sent to the cloud. For automakers, CaLLM Edge delivers not only improved assistant performance, but also cost efficiency – by leveraging a fully embedded SLM model, OEMs can keep costs under control while still delivering a generative AI-based experience for their drivers.\n\n“CaLLM Edge fundamentally transforms the way users can interact with their systems, enabling them to access the rich, responsive experiences they’ve come to expect from cloud-based systems no matter where they are,” said Nils Schanz, EVP, Product & Technology, Cerence. “As we continue to leverage our embedded and cloud expertise and advancements in generative AI and LLMs throughout our product architecture, we not only further expand the capabilities of our current solutions portfolio but also advance our next-gen platform. We’re proud to partner with Microsoft to unite our deep vertical expertise and strength in embedded solutions with their industry-leading language model capabilities.”\n\n“Adapted AI models are becoming increasingly necessary in order to deliver intelligent, capable agent experiences across industries. We’re pleased to work with Cerence to offer CaLLM Edge in the Azure AI model catalog, giving automotive organizations the opportunity to build AI solutions in Azure AI Studio and Microsoft Copilot Studio,” said Satish Thomas, Corporate Vice President, Business & Industry Solutions, Microsoft. “Cerence’s unique automotive dataset brings incredible value, enabling a high level of accuracy and relevance throughout the user interaction – all in an embedded architecture that means the experience is available at all times.”\n\nTo learn more about Cerence, visit [www.cerence.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Lyy9Z2FtSoJhohi905Z6N5E4PE3mLkFRZv3nkPSqeiByLppeKNrtZFn77fzlBl6-UjhmSzOTY3JEfOHbbXcWcQ==), and follow the company on [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YVEOcZTRDh_uKJOiKAdPzrDIY9qe0uS510jkHUJ6PiqB6XBreQiYN9LRbW-iDY-qRrp4NzdWK8P3MsfYBAp6YlbXCqZXquw3f7yRSnlmJyI=).\n\n**About Cerence Inc.** Cerence (NASDAQ: CRNC) is the global industry leader in creating unique, moving experiences for the mobility world.
