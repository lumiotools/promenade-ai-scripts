We expect these improvements will continue to support favorable retention and use of the faidr app as we transition to driving subscription revenue in 2025.”\n\nAuddia has focused on growing its user retention for the past year through a steady cadence of product enhancements that included new ad-free podcast listening experiences, integrations into Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as numerous UX improvements under its faidr 3.1 initiative. These efforts have resulted in compelling gains in 30-day retention, growing from 5% to over 20% over the past year. As the Company continues to add value to the listening experience, it expects continued success with retention, which serves as the baseline for conversions to the paid subscription tier. Executions to optimize the conversion of subscriptions from the free tier are starting this month with updated subscription conversion metrics and new revenue expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**About Auddia Inc.**\n\nAuddia, through its proprietary AI platform for audio identification and classification, is reinventing how consumers engage with AM/FM radio, podcasts, and other audio content.
