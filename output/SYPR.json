(Nasdaq/GM: SYPR) today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 29, 2024. \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Revenue for the quarter increased 6.2% year-over-year, driven by a 13.6% increase for Sypris Electronics and a 0.7% increase for Sypris Technologies. Orders were up 6.5% for the quarter and 13.4% year-to-date, reflecting positive growth for both businesses. \n  * Gross profit for the Company increased 48.0% from the prior-year period and increased 6.0% sequentially, while gross margin expanded 480 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. \n  * EPS increased to $0.02 per diluted share, up from a loss of $0.03 per diluted share for the prior-year quarter, and up from $0.00 per diluted share sequentially. \n  * Revenue for Sypris Electronics increased 13.6%, reflecting the positive impact of recently announced contracts with customers serving the markets for electronic warfare, subsea communications, and aircraft and missile avionics. Orders are up 14.2% year-to-date. \n  * Gross profit for Sypris Technologies surged 150.9% year-over-year and 34.6% sequentially, while gross margin expanded 1,130 basis points and 360 basis points, respectively. Orders for energy products are up 11.8% year-to-date. \n  * During the quarter, Sypris Technologies announced that it entered into a long-term sole-source extension to its current supply agreement with one of the world’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers. The agreement provides for a continuation of Sypris’ Ultra® Axle Shafts for use in the assemblies of the customer’s branded drive axles for medium and heavy-duty trucks. \n  * The Company updated its full-year outlook for 2024, with revenue now expected to increase 10% year-over-year, at the lower end of our prior guidance due to temporary production delays on three of our Sypris Electronics programs during the year. We continue to expect a 100-125 basis point increase in gross margin. \n\n\n\n──────────────────── \n\n“We were pleased with the year-over-year revenue growth at Sypris Electronics,” commented Jeffrey T. Gill, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The backlog at Sypris Electronics exceeds $100 million and is expected to support growth through the remainder of 2024 and beyond. Customer funding has already been secured for a significant portion of these key programs, which enables us to procure inventory under multi-year purchase orders to mitigate future supply chain issues. \n\n“Demand from Sypris Technologies customers serving the automotive, commercial vehicle, sport utility and off-highway markets has remained relatively stable, with new product line shipments offsetting the anticipated cyclical decline for the commercial vehicle market. We believe that the market diversification Sypris Technologies has accomplished over recent years by adding new programs in the automotive, sport-utility and off-highway markets will help offset some of this decline. \n\n“Orders for our energy products increased during the period, and additional opportunities for growth may exist with new global projects in support of increasing LNG demand. We are also actively pursuing applications for our products in adjacent markets including CO2 capture to further diversify our industry and customer portfolios.” \n\n**Third Quarter Results**\n\nThe Company reported revenue of $35.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $33.6 million for the prior-year comparable period. Additionally, the Company reported net income of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the prior-year period. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company reported revenue of $106.7 million compared to $101.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. The Company reported a net loss of $1.8 million compared with a loss of $0.5 million for the prior-year period. \n\n**Sypris Technologies**\n\nRevenue for Sypris Technologies was $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $19.3 million for the prior-year period, reflecting strong energy shipments during the period, partially offset by the anticipated cyclical decline in the commercial vehicle market. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, or 18.8% of revenue, compared to $1.5 million, or 7.5% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from a favorable mix and favorable exchange rates. \n\n**Sypris Electronics**\n\nRevenue for Sypris Electronics was $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $14.2 million for the prior-year period. Increased shipments for a follow-on program contributed to the growth over the prior-year comparable period. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.3 million, or 14.3% of revenue, compared to $2.6 million, or 18.1% of revenue, for the same period in 2023 primarily due to additional labor and overhead costs incurred on programs that recently ramped production and an unfavorable mix. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nCommenting on the future, Mr. Gill added, “Demand from customers serving the markets for electronic warfare, aircraft and missile avionics, secure and subsea communications, and ground-based radar remain robust, while the outlook for the energy market continues to move in the right direction. Similarly, demand from customers serving the automotive, commercial vehicle and sport utility markets remains healthy despite the anticipated cyclical decline in the commercial vehicle market. \n\n“With a strong backlog, new program wins, and long-term contract extensions in place, we are confident that the remainder of 2024 has the potential to be very positive for Sypris. We have updated our outlook for 2024 to include a 10% growth in the top line, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance. We continue to expect a 100-125 basis point increase in margin.” \n\n**About Sypris Solutions**\n\nSypris Solutions is a diversified manufacturing and engineering services company serving the defense, transportation, communications, and energy industries.

our failure to achieve and maintain profitability on a timely basis by steadily increasing our revenues from profitable contracts with a diversified group of customers, which would cause us to continue to use existing cash resources or require us to sell assets to fund operating losses; volatility of our customers’ forecasts and our contractual obligations to meet current scheduling demands and production levels, which may negatively impact our operational capacity and our effectiveness to integrate new customers or suppliers, and in turn cause increases in our inventory and working capital levels; the termination or non-renewal of existing contracts by customers; dependence on, retention or recruitment of key employees and highly skilled personnel and distribution of our human capital; risks of foreign operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure, which could impact our operating results; cost, quality and availability or lead times of raw materials such as steel, component parts (especially electronic components), natural gas or utilities including increased cost relating to inflation; the cost, quality, timeliness, efficiency and yield of our operations and capital investments, including the impact of inflation, tariffs, product recalls or related liabilities, employee training, working capital, production schedules, cycle times, scrap rates, injuries, wages, overtime costs, freight or expediting costs; unanticipated or uninsured product liability claims, disasters, public health crises, losses or business risks; our failure to successfully complete final contract negotiations with regard to our announced contract “orders”, “wins” or “awards”; our reliance on a few key customers, third party vendors and sub-suppliers; significant delays or reductions due to a prolonged continuing resolution or U.S. government shutdown reducing the spending on products and services that Sypris Electronics provides; adverse impacts of new technologies or other competitive pressures which increase our costs or erode our margins; the costs and supply of insurance on acceptable terms and with adequate coverage; breakdowns, relocations or major repairs of machinery and equipment, especially in our Toluca Plant; the costs of compliance with our auditing, regulatory or contractual obligations; pension valuation, health care or other benefit costs; our reliance on revenues from customers in the oil and gas and automotive markets, with increasing consumer pressure for reductions in environmental impacts attributed to greenhouse gas emissions and increased vehicle fuel economy; our failure to successfully win new business or develop new or improved products or new markets for our products; war, geopolitical conflict, terrorism, or political uncertainty, or disruptions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel and Gaza conflict, including arising out of international sanctions, foreign currency fluctuations and other economic impacts; inventory valuation risks including excessive or obsolescent valuations or price erosions of raw materials or component parts on hand or other potential impairments, non-recoverability or write-offs of assets or deferred costs; labor relations; strikes; union negotiations; disputes or litigation involving governmental, supplier, customer, employee, creditor, stockholder, product liability, warranty or environmental claims; failure to adequately insure or to identify product liability, environmental or other insurable risks; costs associated with environmental claims relating to properties previously owned; our inability to patent or otherwise protect our inventions or other intellectual property rights from potential competitors or fully exploit such rights which could materially affect our ability to compete in our chosen markets; changes in licenses, security clearances, or other legal rights to operate, manage our work force or import and export as needed; cyber security threats and disruptions, including ransomware attacks on our systems and the systems of third-party vendors and other parties with which we conduct business, all of which may become more pronounced in the event of geopolitical conflicts and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine; the cost and availability of full-time accounting personnel with technical accounting knowledge to execute, review and approve all aspects of the financial statement close and reporting process; our ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards minimum closing bid price; risks related to owning our common stock, including increased volatility; possible public policy response to a public health emergency, including U. S or foreign government legislation or restrictions that may impact our operations or supply chain; or unknown risks and uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law._\n\n**SYPRIS SOLUTIONS, INC.**  \n---  \n**Financial Highlights**  \n(In thousands, except per share amounts)   \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 29 ,** |  **October 1 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \nRevenue |  $  |  35,657  |  $  |  33,581   \nNet income (loss) |  $  |  390  |  $  |  (555  |  )   \nIncome (loss) per common share:  \nBasic |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  (0.03  |  )   \nDiluted |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  (0.03  |  )   \nWeighted average shares outstanding:  \nBasic |  22,088  |  21,880   \nDiluted |  22,415  |  21,880   \n**Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29 ,** |  **October 1 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \nRevenue |  $  |  106,731  |  $  |  101,488   \nNet loss |  $  |  (1,815  |  )  |  $  |  (517  |  )   \nLoss per common share:  \nBasic |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.02  |  )   \nDiluted |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.02  |  )   \nWeighted average shares outstanding:  \nBasic |  22,011  |  21,848   \nDiluted |  22,011  |  21,848   \n  \n**Sypris Solutions, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**(in thousands, except for per share data)**  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 29 ,** |  **October 1 ,** |  **September 29 ,** |  **October 1 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **(Unaudited)**  \nNet revenue:  \nSypris Technologies |  $  |  19,469  |  $  |  19,337  |  $  |  55,660  |  $  |  58,895   \nSypris Electronics |  16,188  |  14,244  |  51,071  |  42,593   \nTotal net revenue |  35,657  |  33,581  |  106,731  |  101,488   \nCost of sales:  \nSypris Technologies |  15,808  |  17,878  |  47,229  |  52,790   \nSypris Electronics |  13,870  |  11,663  |  44,998  |  35,827   \nTotal cost of sales |  29,678  |  29,541  |  92,227  |  88,617   \nGross profit:  \nSypris Technologies |  3,661  |  1,459  |  8,431  |  6,105   \nSypris Electronics |  2,318  |  2,581  |  6,073  |  6,766   \nTotal gross profit |  5,979  |  4,040  |  14,504  |  12,871   \nSelling, general and administrative |  4,250  |  4,170  |  12,876  |  11,619   \nOperating income (loss) |  1,729  |  (130  |  )  |  1,628  |  1,252   \nInterest expense, net |  546  |  127  |  1,468  |  531   \nOther expense, net |  246  |  199  |  781  |  783   \nIncome (loss) before taxes |  937  |  (456  |  )  |  (621  |  )  |  (62  |  )   \nIncome tax expense, net |  547  |  99  |  1,194  |  455   \nNet income (loss) |  $  |  390  |  $  |  (555  |  )  |  $  |  (1,815  |  )  |  $  |  (517  |  )   \nIncome (loss) per common share:  \nBasic |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  (0.03  |  )  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.02  |  )   \nDiluted |  $  |  0.02  |  $  |  (0.03  |  )  |  $  |  (0.08  |  )  |  $  |  (0.02  |  )   \nDividends declared per common share |  $  |  -  |  $  |  -  |  $  |  -  |  $  |  -   \nWeighted average shares outstanding:  \nBasic |  22,088  |  21,880  |  22,011  |  21,848   \nDiluted |  22,415  |  21,880  |  22,011  |  21,848   \n  \n**Sypris Solutions, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(in thousands, except for share data)**  \n**September 29 ,** |  **December 31 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)** |  **(Note)**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  8,215  |  $  |  7,881   \nAccounts receivable, net  |  12,373  |  8,929   \nInventory, net  |  67,333  |  77,314   \nOther current assets  |  11,457  |  9,743   \nTotal current assets  |  99,378  |  103,867   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  13,914  |  17,133   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets  |  4,012  |  3,309   \nOther assets  |  4,309  |  5,033   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  121,613  |  $  |  129,342   \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  22,630  |  $  |  26,737   \nAccrued liabilities  |  50,813  |  56,232   \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion  |  882  |  1,068   \nFinance lease obligations, current portion  |  1,467  |  1,327   \nEquipment financing obligations, current portion  |  522  |  618   \nWorking capital line of credit  |  500  |  500   \nNote payable - related party, current portion  |  2,000  |  -   \nTotal current liabilities  |  78,814  |  86,482   \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion  |  3,552  |  2,642   \nFinance lease obligations, net of current portion  |  1,133  |  1,852   \nEquipment financing obligations, net of current portion  |  959  |  1,333   \nNote payable - related party, net of current portion  |  6,984  |  6,484   \nOther liabilities  |  11,999  |  8,082   \nTotal liabilities  |  103,441  |  106,875   \nStockholders’ equity:   \nPreferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, 975,150 shares authorized;

our failure to achieve and maintain profitability on a timely basis by steadily increasing our revenues from profitable contracts with a diversified group of customers, which would cause us to continue to use existing cash resources or require us to sell assets to fund operating losses; dependence on, retention or recruitment of key employees and highly skilled personnel and distribution of our human capital; the cost and availability of full-time accounting personnel with technical accounting knowledge to execute, review and approve all aspects of the financial statement close and reporting process; volatility of our customers’ forecasts and our contractual obligations to meet current scheduling demands and production levels, which may negatively impact our operational capacity and our effectiveness to integrate new customers or suppliers, and in turn cause increases in our inventory and working capital levels; risks of foreign operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure, which could impact our operating results; cost, quality and availability or lead times of raw materials such as steel, component parts (especially electronic components), natural gas or utilities including increased cost relating to inflation; the cost, quality, timeliness, efficiency and yield of our operations and capital investments, including the impact of inflation, tariffs, product recalls or related liabilities, employee training, working capital, production schedules, cycle times, scrap rates, injuries, wages, overtime costs, freight or expediting costs; the termination or non-renewal of existing contracts by customers; our failure to successfully complete final contract negotiations with regard to our announced contract “orders”, “wins” or “awards”; significant delays or reductions due to a prolonged continuing resolution or U.S. government shutdown reducing the spending on products and services that Sypris Electronics provides; adverse impacts of new technologies or other competitive pressures which increase our costs or erode our margins; the costs and supply of insurance on acceptable terms and with adequate coverage; breakdowns, relocations or major repairs of machinery and equipment, especially in our Toluca Plant; the costs of compliance with our auditing, regulatory or contractual obligations; pension valuation, health care or other benefit costs; our reliance on revenues from customers in the oil and gas and automotive markets, with increasing consumer pressure for reductions in environmental impacts attributed to greenhouse gas emissions and increased vehicle fuel economy; our failure to successfully win new business or develop new or improved products or new markets for our products; war, geopolitical conflict, terrorism, or political uncertainty, or disruptions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel and Gaza conflict, including arising out of international sanctions, foreign currency fluctuations and other economic impacts; our reliance on a few key customers, third party vendors and sub-suppliers; inventory valuation risks including excessive or obsolescent valuations or price erosions of raw materials or component parts on hand or other potential impairments, non-recoverability or write-offs of assets or deferred costs; disputes or litigation involving governmental, supplier, customer, employee, creditor, stockholder, product liability, warranty or environmental claims; failure to adequately insure or to identify product liability, environmental or other insurable risks; unanticipated or uninsured product liability claims, disasters, public health crises, losses or business risks; labor relations; strikes; union negotiations; costs associated with environmental claims relating to properties previously owned; our inability to patent or otherwise protect our inventions or other intellectual property rights from potential competitors or fully exploit such rights which could materially affect our ability to compete in our chosen markets; changes in licenses, security clearances, or other legal rights to operate, manage our work force or import and export as needed; cyber security threats and disruptions, including ransomware attacks on our systems and the systems of third-party vendors and other parties with which we conduct business, all of which may become more pronounced in the event of geopolitical conflicts and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine; our ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards minimum closing bid price; risks related to owning our common stock, including increased volatility; possible public policy response to a public health emergency, including U.S. or foreign government legislation or restrictions that may impact our operations or supply chain; or unknown risks and uncertainties.

(Nasdaq/GM: SYPR) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS** ───────────────────── \n\n  * The Company’s second quarter 2024 consolidated revenue was even with the prior year at $35.5 million, reflecting a rotation in mix driven by continued growth at Sypris Electronics and reduced shipments for Sypris Technologies. Orders are up 15.8% year-to-date, reflecting positive growth for both businesses. \n  * Gross profit for the Company increased 20.8% from the prior-year period and increased 95.6% sequentially, while gross margin expanded 280 basis points and 780 basis points, respectively. \n  * Revenue for Sypris Electronics increased 13.6%, reflecting the positive impact of recently announced contracts with customers serving the markets for electronic warfare, aircraft and missile avionics, and subsea communications. Gross profit increased 9.7% from the prior year and 250.8% sequentially. Orders are up 16.6% year-to-date. \n  * Gross profit for Sypris Technologies increased 35.5% year-over-year and 32.6% sequentially, while gross margin expanded 520 basis points and 400 basis points, respectively. Orders for energy products are up 13.6% year-to-date. \n  * During the quarter, Sypris Electronics announced that it received releases for an additional four systems under a multi-year production contract that was first announced in 2022. The modules to be produced by Sypris will be integrated into an electronic warfare improvement program for the U.S. Navy. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2024. \n  * Subsequent to quarter end, Sypris Technologies announced that it entered into a long-term sole-source extension to its current supply agreement with one of the world’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers. The agreement provides for a continuation of Sypris’ Ultra® Axle Shafts for use in the assemblies of the customer’s branded drive axles for medium and heavy-duty trucks. \n  * The Company reaffirmed its full-year outlook for 2024, maintaining the expected increase in revenue at 10-15% year-over-year. Gross profit is expected to increase 20-25%, while gross margins are expected to expand 100-125 basis points year-over-year. \n\n\n\n──────────────────── \n\n“We were pleased with the year-over-year revenue growth at Sypris Electronics,” commented Jeffrey T. Gill, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The backlog at Sypris Electronics exceeds $100 million and is expected to support growth through the remainder of 2024 and beyond. Customer funding has already been secured for a portion of these key programs, which enables us to procure inventory under multi-year purchase orders to mitigate future supply chain issues. \n\n“Demand from Sypris Technologies customers serving the automotive, commercial vehicle, sport utility and off-highway markets has remained relatively stable, with new product line shipments offsetting the anticipated cyclical decline for the commercial vehicle market. We believe that the market diversification Sypris Technologies has accomplished over recent years by adding new programs in the automotive, sport-utility and off-highway markets will help offset some of this decline. \n\n“Orders for our energy products increased during the period, with open quotes yet to be closed still outstanding on several large projects. Additional opportunities for growth may exist with new global projects in support of increasing LNG demand. We are also actively pursuing applications for our products in adjacent markets to further diversify our industry and customer portfolios.” \n\n**Second Quarter Results**\n\nThe Company reported revenue of $35.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $35.6 million for the prior-year comparable period. Additionally, the Company reported breakeven net income compared with net income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the prior-year period. \n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported revenue of $71.1 million compared to $67.9 million for the first half of 2023. The Company reported a net loss of $2.2 million compared with breakeven for the prior-year period. \n\n**Sypris Technologies**\n\nRevenue for Sypris Technologies was $17.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $20.1 million for the prior-year period, reflecting the short-term timing delay of certain energy shipments and the anticipated cyclical decline in the commercial vehicle market. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.7 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $2.0 million, or 10.0% of revenue, for the same period in 2023. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 benefited from a favorable mix and higher absorption. \n\n**Sypris Electronics**\n\nRevenue for Sypris Electronics was $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $15.6 million for the prior-year period. Increased shipments for a follow-on program contributed to the growth over the prior-year comparable period. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2024 was $2.9 million, or 16.5% of revenue, compared to $2.7 million, or 17.1% of revenue, for the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher revenue and favorable material costs, partially offset by additional labor and overhead costs incurred on programs that recently ramped production. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nCommenting on the future, Mr. Gill added, “Demand from customers serving the markets for electronic warfare, aircraft and missile avionics, secure and subsea communications, and ground-based radar remain robust, while the outlook for the energy market continues to move in the right direction. Similarly, demand from customers serving the automotive, commercial vehicle and sport utility markets remains healthy despite the anticipated cyclical decline in the commercial vehicle market. \n\n“With a strong backlog, new program wins, and long-term contract extensions in place, we are confident that the second half of 2024 has the potential to be very positive for Sypris. As a result, we continue to expect revenue to increase 10-15% year-over-year. We expect to achieve gross margin expansion in the range of 100 to 125 basis points with gross profit forecast to increase 20-25% in 2024.” \n\n**About Sypris Solutions**\n\nSypris Solutions is a diversified manufacturing and engineering services company serving the defense, transportation, communications, and energy industries.

our failure to achieve and maintain profitability on a timely basis by steadily increasing our revenues from profitable contracts with a diversified group of customers, which would cause us to continue to use existing cash resources or require us to sell assets to fund operating losses; dependence on, retention or recruitment of key employees and highly skilled personnel and distribution of our human capital; the cost and availability of full-time accounting personnel with technical accounting knowledge to execute, review and approve all aspects of the financial statement close and reporting process; volatility of our customers’ forecasts and our contractual obligations to meet current scheduling demands and production levels, which may negatively impact our operational capacity and our effectiveness to integrate new customers or suppliers, and in turn cause increases in our inventory and working capital levels; risks of foreign operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure, which could impact our operating results; cost, quality and availability or lead times of raw materials such as steel, component parts (especially electronic components), natural gas or utilities including increased cost relating to inflation; the cost, quality, timeliness, efficiency and yield of our operations and capital investments, including the impact of inflation, tariffs, product recalls or related liabilities, employee training, working capital, production schedules, cycle times, scrap rates, injuries, wages, overtime costs, freight or expediting costs; the termination or non-renewal of existing contracts by customers; our failure to successfully complete final contract negotiations with regard to our announced contract “orders”, “wins” or “awards”; significant delays or reductions due to a prolonged continuing resolution or U.S. government shutdown reducing the spending on products and services that Sypris Electronics provides; adverse impacts of new technologies or other competitive pressures which increase our costs or erode our margins; the costs and supply of insurance on acceptable terms and with adequate coverage; breakdowns, relocations or major repairs of machinery and equipment, especially in our Toluca Plant; the costs of compliance with our auditing, regulatory or contractual obligations; pension valuation, health care or other benefit costs; our reliance on revenues from customers in the oil and gas and automotive markets, with increasing consumer pressure for reductions in environmental impacts attributed to greenhouse gas emissions and increased vehicle fuel economy; our failure to successfully win new business or develop new or improved products or new markets for our products; war, geopolitical conflict, terrorism, or political uncertainty, or disruptions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel and Gaza conflict, including arising out of international sanctions, foreign currency fluctuations and other economic impacts; our reliance on a few key customers, third party vendors and sub-suppliers; inventory valuation risks including excessive or obsolescent valuations or price erosions of raw materials or component parts on hand or other potential impairments, non-recoverability or write-offs of assets or deferred costs; disputes or litigation involving governmental, supplier, customer, employee, creditor, stockholder, product liability, warranty or environmental claims; failure to adequately insure or to identify product liability, environmental or other insurable risks; unanticipated or uninsured product liability claims, disasters, public health crises, losses or business risks; labor relations; strikes; union negotiations; costs associated with environmental claims relating to properties previously owned; our inability to patent or otherwise protect our inventions or other intellectual property rights from potential competitors or fully exploit such rights which could materially affect our ability to compete in our chosen markets; changes in licenses, security clearances, or other legal rights to operate, manage our work force or import and export as needed; cyber security threats and disruptions, including ransomware attacks on our systems and the systems of third-party vendors and other parties with which we conduct business, all of which may become more pronounced in the event of geopolitical conflicts and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine; our ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards minimum closing bid price; risks related to owning our common stock, including increased volatility; possible public policy response to a public health emergency, including U.S. or foreign government legislation or restrictions that may impact our operations or supply chain; or unknown risks and uncertainties.
