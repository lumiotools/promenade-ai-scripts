Shareholders holding the Company’s\nshares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later, on or about December 20, 2024.\nPeder Simonsen, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, commented:\n\"Golden Ocean delivered strong performance with achieved market rates significantly above the indexes for the\nthird quarter. This is attributable to our modern, fuel-efficient fleet, strong commercial capabilities, and industry\nleading low cash-break-even. We continue to execute on our strategy of divesting older and less efficient tonnage\nat attractive valuations. The macro and geopolitical environment creates volatility in the financial markets and\nfreight market impacting sentiment, despite healthy trading volumes across all commodities. Looking ahead, the\nfreight market is expected to benefit with tonne-mile growth, with the strong iron ore and bauxite exports out of\nBrazil and Guinea to Asia being the main driver. Combined with a healthy vessel supply outlook we remain\noptimistic for the years to come. With a modern fleet and strong balance sheet, Golden Ocean is well positioned to\ngenerate strong cash flow and attractive returns to our shareholders.”\n1Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Adjusted net income/(loss) and Adjusted basic earnings/(loss) per share are\nnon-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income/(loss) and Adjusted basic earnings/(loss) per share to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure is included in the back part of this report.\n2TCE rate, or time charter equivalent rate, is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of TCE rate to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the back part of\nthis report.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n2\nFleet Development & Performance\nAs of the date of this report, the Company's fleet consists of 91 vessels with an aggregate capacity of\napproximately 13.8 million deadweight tonnes (\"dwt\"). The Company's fleet consists of:\na. 83 vessels owned by the Company (51 Capesize and 32 Panamax vessels); and\nb. Eight Capesize vessels chartered in on long-term leases with profit-sharing arrangements.\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into agreements to sell one Newcastlemax vessel and one Panamax\nvessel for a total net consideration of $56.8 million. The vessels were delivered to their new owners in the\nfourth quarter of 2024, and classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. Total gain from sale of\napproximately $16.5 million will be recorded upon delivery in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThirteen drydocks of Capesize vessels are expected to be carried out in the fourth quarter of 2024. Four of these\nhave been substantially completed as of the date of this report. Further, seven drydocks are pending in the first\nquarter of 2025, mostly for Capesize vessels.\nThe Company’s estimated TCE rates for the fourth quarter of 2024 are $26,300 per day for 82% of available\ndays for Capesize vessels and $14,600 per day for 83% of available days for Panamax vessels. These estimates\nare forward-looking statements and based on time charter contracts entered into by the Company as well as\ncurrent spot fixtures on the load-to-discharge method, whereby revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the voyage from the commencement of loading to the completion of discharge. The actual TCE rates to be\nearned will depend on the number of contracted days and the number of ballast days at the end of the period\nwhen vessels are sailing without cargo. According to the load-to-discharge accounting method, the Company\nwill not be able to recognize revenue for any ballast days or uncontracted days at the end of the fourth quarter\nof 2024. At the same time, expenses for uncontracted days cannot be deferred and will be recognized.\nThe Company has secured 27% of total days at an average rate of $21,060 per day for Capesize vessels and 15%\nof total days for Panamax vessels at an average rate of $17,500 per day in the first quarter of 2025.\nCorporate Development\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company renewed its existing share buy-back program for a further 12 months, up to\nOctober 4, 2025.\nIn October 2024, the Company entered into a $150 million credit facility with a group of first tier European\nshipping banks to refinance six Newcastlemax vessels. The senior secured credit facility has a five-year tenor\nand an age-adjusted amortization profile of 20 years. The facility is priced with interest rate of Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (‘’SOFR’’) plus a margin of 165 basis points per annum, and includes sustainability\nlinked pricing element with an additional 5 basis points pricing adjustment dependent on emission reduction\nperformance.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n3\nThe Company announced today a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2024, which is\npayable on or about December 18, 2024, to shareholders of record on December 9, 2024. Shareholders holding\nthe Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later on or about December 20,\n2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Results\nThird Quarter 2024 Income Statements\nThe Company reported net income of $56.3 million and basic earnings per share of $0.28 for the third quarter\nof 2024, compared to net income of $62.5 million and basic earnings per share of $0.31 for the second quarter\nof 2024.\nAdjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $66.7 million, compared to $63.4 million for the second\nquarter of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $124.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $4.1 million from $120.3\nmillion for the second quarter of 2024.\nOperating revenues were $260.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $10.5 million from $250.1\nmillion in the second quarter of 2024. The Company achieved an average TCE rate for the entire fleet of $23,726\nper day in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $23,535 per day in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe total number of onhire days increased by 226 days compared to the second quarter of 2024, due in part to\na 118-day increase in trading activity days. Five vessels were in drydocks during the third quarter of 2024,\ncompared to four vessels in previous quarter, resulting in 253 offhire days, compared to 193 offhire days in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. Voyage expenses increased by $1.3 million to $54.1 million from the second quarter of\n2024 mostly due to higher port expenses as a result of different trading pattern.\nOther revenues were $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.2 million in the second quarter\nof 2024 as a result of insurance income being recognized in the period.\nGain from disposal of vessels was $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the sale of one Panamax\nvessel. No gain from disposal of vessels was recorded in the second quarter of 2024.\nShip operating expenses amounted to $69.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $66.3 million in\nthe second quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, ship operating expenses included $54.9 million in\nrunning and other various expenses (compared to $54.1 million in the second quarter of 2024). Running\nexpenses mainly consisted of crew costs, repairs and maintenance, spares and insurance.\nIn addition to running expenses, ship operating expenses included $9.7 million in drydocking expenses\n(compared to $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2024) and $2.4 million in various energy saving initiatives\nand digitalization expenses (compared to $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2024). In the third quarter of\n2024, $2.4 million in estimated ship operating expenses for vessels on time charter-in contracts were\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n4\nreclassified from charterhire expenses to ship operating expenses (compared to $1.5 million in the second\nquarter of 2024) and calculated based on numbers of chartered in days and an estimated operating expenses\nrate per day of $5,700.\nCharter hire expenses were $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $4.8 million in the second\nquarter of 2024. Most of the increase relates to the increase in chartered-in days compared to the second\nquarter of 2024 of 118 days.\nAdministrative expenses were $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.1 million in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nDepreciation was $35.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $35.2 million in the second quarter\nof 2024.\nNet interest expense was $25.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from $0.2 million in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a $11.0 million net loss on derivatives, mainly resulting\nfrom $14.5 million in unrealized loss on the mark-to-market changes of interest rate swaps, a $0.5 million\nrealized loss on forward freight agreements and bunker derivatives, which was partially offset by $4.0 million\nin realized gains/interest income on interest rate swaps.\nThe Company recorded a loss from associated companies of $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto a loss of $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $117.6 million, including restricted\ncash balances of $1.4 million, an increase of $14.6 million from the second quarter of 2024. In addition, the\nCompany had $150.0 million available under its revolving credit facilities. In the third quarter of 2024, cash\nprovided by operating activities amounted to $100.8 million, including a negative working capital change of\n$2.9 million and dividends of $0.2 million received from associated companies.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total net cash used in investing activities was $4.4 million,\nfollowing $25.2 million in installment payments and other costs for our Kamsarmax newbuilding contracts,\npartially offset by $20.8 million proceeds from the sale of Golden Ruby.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $81.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 and included a partial $21.6\nmillion drawdown on the $85 million credit facility upon delivery of one newbuilding in the period. Further,\n$28.9 million in scheduled debt repayment, $8.1million in prepayment of debt related to one Panamax vessel\nsold in the period, $6.1 million in repayment of finance leases, $0.3 million in debt fees and $60.0 million in\ndividend payments were recorded.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n5\nAs of September 30, 2024, the book value of the Company's long-term debt was $1,320.5 million, including the\ncurrent portion of long-term debt of $115.6 million. The book value of finance lease obligations was $72.9\nmillion, including the current portion of finance lease obligations of $19.5 million.\nThe Dry Bulk Market\nThe dry bulk market remained healthy in the third quarter of 2024, supported by continued strong Chinese\ndemand for coal, bauxite and iron ore. Freight rate momentum carried over from the prior quarter, supported\nby year-over-year demand growth across all commodity groups as well as longer sailing distances. Once again,\nlarger vessel segments where the Company’s fleet is focused, showed relative strength on the back of strong\ndemand trade of iron ore and bauxite in the Atlantic basin. Global dry bulk fleet utilization (calculated as total\ntonne-mile demand divided by total available fleet capacity) was 89.1% in the third quarter of 2024, according\nto Maritime Analytics, indicating a continued tight market balance. Total seaborne transportation of dry bulk\ngoods was 1,272 mt in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 2.0% compared with the second\nquarter of 2024 and 4.5% compared with the third quarter of 2023.\nGlobal steel production declined by 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the second quarter of\n2024, driven by a 12.0% decline in production in China, the world’s largest steel producer. Indian steel\nproduction was relatively unchanged in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the second quarter of 2024\nbut increased by 2.8% compared with the third quarter of 2023, continuing a steady long-term upwards\ntrajectory. Outside of China and India, steel production decreased by 4.5% compared with the prior quarter.\nGlobal steel production is expected to increase over the next several years as construction activity recovers\nfrom current depressed levels.\nThird quarter global iron ore imports increased by 1.5% compared with the second quarter of 2024 and by\n0.8% compared with the third quarter of 2023. Chinese iron ore imports increased by 2.1% compared with\nboth the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Imports of iron ore to China from Brazil\nincreased by 25.8% in the third quarter of 2024, the second consecutive quarter of +25% sequential growth.\nBrazilian iron ore exports reached the highest level since 2018, and exports are expected to remain robust for\nthe balance of the year, providing continued support to tonne-mile demand for Capesize vessels.\nGlobal coal imports increased by 6.7% in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the second quarter of 2024\nand by 6.1% compared with the third quarter of 2023, driven by elevated imports to China, Japan, South Korea,\nand Europe. Chinese coal imports reached a yet another record level during the third quarter of 2024.\nTrade of minor bulks, including bauxite, increased by 0.1% compared with the second quarter of 2024 and by\n5.7% compared with the third quarter of 2023. Global bauxite volumes are down 9% compared to second\nquarter of 2024 due to an unusually severe rainy season in West Africa. However, global bauxite trade is up\n15% compared to third quarter of 2023 and up 18% for the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by\nincreased Guinean export volumes. Bauxite exports from Guinea have grown significantly in recent years, with\nover 70% of volumes traveling long distances to China. This trade, which is primarily carried out by Capesize\nvessels, has provided strong incremental demand throughout the year.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n6\nTransportation of essential agribulks, which includes wheat, corn and soybeans, decreased by 2.5% compared\nwith the second quarter of 2024 but increased by 7.7% compared with the third quarter of 2023. Despite the\ndecrease in volumes, tonne-mile demand for agribulks increased by 15.4% compared with the third quarter of\n2023 as sailing distances both have seen a structural increase and is impacted by the Red Sea situation.\nMaritime Analytics expects global agribulk tonne-mile demand to grow by 9.1% in 2024 before moderating to\n1.9% in 2025.\nThe global fleet of dry bulk vessels amounted to 1,027.8 million dwt at the end of the third quarter of 2024,\nabsorbing a net increase of 7.9 million dwt (0.8%) in the quarter. A total of 7.5 million dwt of vessels was\nordered during the quarter, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2021. Capesize vessels represented less\nthan 10% of orders, based on dwt. The orderbook as a percentage of the global fleet stood at 10.5% at the end\nof the third quarter, roughly unchanged from the start of 2024, but well below an average exceeding 20% over\nthe last 25 years and remains near historical low levels. The Capesize orderbook stands at 7.5% as of the end\nof the quarter, the lowest percentage among the dry bulk segments. Vessel recycling was not meaningful in the\nCapesize and Panamax segments in the third quarter of 2024, and port congestion remained at low levels from\na historical perspective. Effective fleet capacity continues to be moderately impacted by longer sailing distances\nas vessels have avoided the Suez Canal due to geopolitical tensions in the region, which was partly offset by a\nslight improvement in conditions that have affected Panama Canal transits over the last several quarters.\nStrategy and Outlook\nThe International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) has maintained its global GDP growth forecasts to 3.2% in 2024 and\ndecreased its 2025 forecast slightly to 3.2% (-0.1%) in its October forecast. The GDP growth forecast for\nemerging Asian economies has also been maintained at 5.4% in 2024 and 5.1% in 2025. The forecast is being\ndriven by India, where GDP is forecast to grow by 7.0% in 2024 and by 6.5% in 2025, while the IMF forecasts\nChina's GDP to grow by 4.8% and 4.5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Further, the IMF has stated that the\nglobal inflation has been largely tamed, although price pressures remain in some countries.\nThe Chinese government has displayed an increasing sense of urgency to act decisively in stimulating its\neconomy through a variety of measures, including monetary easing, property deregulation, and bank\nrecapitalization. In July, China announced the largest interest rate cut since 2020, along with subsidies for\nelectric vehicles, which generate significant demand for bauxite, and other measures to stimulate consumer\nspending. August saw the highest level of local government special bond issuance since February 2022.\nFollowing the meeting of the National People’s Congress earlier this month, the Chinese government\nannounced a series of fiscal policies to continue to provide debt relief to local governments, support portions\nof the property market, recapitalize banks, and increase support for low-income householder and students.\nThe country’s Minister of Finance stated that there is “relatively big room” for China to issue debt and increase\nthe fiscal deficit, suggesting potential for additional fiscal policies to support the economy.\nIndia’s economy is expected to continue to grow at a strong pace. Its economic trajectory continues to drive\ndemand for dry bulk commodities (4% annual growth last five years), positioning the country as a critical\nplayer for the foreseeable future. The Indian government has prioritized infrastructure investment, with an\nunprecedented allocation of nearly $134 billion for 2024-25. This commitment to infrastructure includes\nextensive road, rail, and port development projects, which are heavily dependent on bulk commodities like\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n7\nsteel, cement, and other raw materials. Given the scale of these projects, demand for construction materials is\nsurging. Additionally, India’s push for rapid industrialization has spurred the need for coal and iron ore to fuel\nits energy and steel production sectors. As India aims to boost its manufacturing sector through initiatives like\n“Make in India,” the demand for raw materials is expected to continue to expand, contributing to rising imports.\nGrowth in new iron ore production mines and exports over the next several years is expected to require further\nvessel capacity, particularly in the Capesize segment. The largest of these projects is the Simandou mine in\nGuinea, which contains the world's largest untapped reserves of high-grade iron ore. Major mining companies,\nincluding Rio Tinto, are actively involved in the project and according to the latest report the project is on track\nto deliver first production in late 2025. In September, Vale raised its 2024 iron ore guidance from 310 – 320\nmillion tons to 323 – 330 million tons. Adding to this positive outlook, Vale has begun commissioning the\nVargem project which will contribute with approximately 15 million tons of increased iron ore production.\nTogether with the Capanema and S11D projects, this represents an important step towards achieving the iron\nore production guidance of 340-360 million metric tons by 2026.\nGlobal tonne-mile demand is forecast to increase 5.0% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025, according to Maritime\nAnalytics, driven by volume growth in continued strength in bauxite and coal trades and longer distances for\niron ore trade. Fleet utilization is forecast to remain elevated, implying continued strength of dry bulk freight\nrates. Any potential disruption to trade flows, including those caused by geopolitical events, may drive fleet\ninefficiency and push utilization and rates higher. The timing of the reopening of the Suez Canal remains\nuncertain, and a normalization of canal transit would likely negatively impact tonne-miles. On the other hand,\nport congestion has bottomed and represents potential upside to fleet utilization forecasts.\nThe outlook for fleet supply remains promising, with limited growth expected over the next several years. The\norderbook stands at historic lows relative to the operating fleet, with new shipbuilding constrained by high\ncosts and limited shipyard capacity. These factors combined with tightening environmental regulations is\nanticipated to support the freight market through 2027. To meet new standards, many shipowners are likely\nto reduce vessel speeds, invest in energy-saving technologies, or consider retiring less efficient vessels. These\nshifts are expected to create a more differentiated market, with varying levels of compliance shaping fleet\ndynamics. Fleet expansion is unlikely to pose significant risks, while external factors such as geopolitical\ntensions and low port congestion could create upside opportunities by impacting the effective supply across\nkey shipping lanes.\nGolden Ocean has effectively pursued a strategy of fleet investment aimed at ensuring robust cash flow\ngeneration across varying market conditions. With industry-leading daily cash breakeven levels averaging\naround $13,750 across the full fleet, the Company has maintained an exceptionally competitive cost base. This\napproach, combining low breakeven rates with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet capable of achieving premium\nrates, not only shields the Company from potential market downturns but also positions it to capitalize on high\ncash flow during favorable market cycles.\nThe Board of Directors continues to prioritize returning value to its shareholder and has consistently allocated\ncapital towards dividends. While the amount and timing of future dividends will be based on the Company's\nfinancial performance, investment opportunities, and the overall market situation, the Company intends to\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n8\ncontinue to distribute a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders. Golden Ocean continues to monitor\nmacroeconomic factors and their potential effects on the large size dry bulk market.\nThe Board of Directors\nGolden Ocean Group Limited\nHamilton, Bermuda\nNovember 27, 2024\nQuestions should be directed to:\nPeder Simonsen: Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS\n+ 47 22 01 73 40\nForward-Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items set forth in the table below,\nwhich represent certain non-cash and other items that the Company believes are not indicative of the ongoing\nperformance of its core operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by analysts in the shipping industry\nas common performance measures to compare results across peers. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not\nitems recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and\nshould not be considered in isolation or used as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from\noperating activity or any other indicator of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity required by\nGAAP.\nThe Company’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is intended to supplement investors’\nunderstanding of the Company’s operating performance by providing information regarding the Company’s\nongoing performance that exclude items the Company believes do not directly affect the Company’s core\noperations and enhancing the comparability of the Company’s ongoing performance across periods. The\nCompany’s management considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful to investors because such\nperformance measures provide information regarding the profitability of the Company’s core operations and\nfacilitate comparison of the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of its peers.\nAdditionally, the Company’s management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures when reviewing the\nCompany’s operating performance.

The Company\ndefines TCE income as operating revenues less voyage expenses and commission plus amortization of\nfavorable/unfavorable charter party contracts (being the fair value above or below market of acquired time\ncharter agreements). Under time charter agreements, voyage costs, such as bunker fuel, canal and port charges\nand commissions are borne and paid by the charterer whereas under voyage charter agreements, voyage costs\nare borne and paid by the owner. TCE income is a common shipping industry performance measure used\nprimarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company’s performance despite changes in the\nmix of charter types (i.e., spot charters and time charters) under which the vessels may be employed between\nthe periods. Time charter equivalent income, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful\ninformation in conjunction with operating revenues, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, because\nit assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of the Company's vessels and in\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n23\nevaluating their financial performance, regardless of whether a vessel has been employed on a time charter or\na voyage charter.\nThree months Three months Three months Nine months Nine months\nended ended ended ended ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(in thousands of $) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal operating revenues 260,621 250,091 221,663 757,447 631,562\nAdd: Amortization of time charter party\nout contracts (427) (423) (447) (1,272) (992)\nLess: Other revenues* 2,487 241 516 3,680 1,777\nNet time and voyage charter revenues 257,707 249,427 220,700 752,495 628,793\nLess: Voyage expenses & commission 54,066 52,743 65,082 156,845 188,708\nTime charter equivalent income 203,641 196,684 155,618 595,650 440,085\n*adjustment includes management fee revenue and other non-voyage related revenues recognized under other revenues.\n(ii) Time Charter Equivalent Rate:\nTime charter equivalent rate (\"TCE rate\") represents the weighted average daily TCE income of the Company's\nentire operating fleet.\nTCE rate is a measure of the average daily income performance. The Company's method of calculating TCE rate\nfor each vessel type is determined by dividing TCE income by onhire days during a reporting period. Onhire\ndays are calculated on a vessel by vessel basis and represent the net of available days and offhire days for each\nvessel (owned or chartered in) in the Company's possession during a reporting period. Available days for a\nvessel during a reporting period is the number of days the vessel (owned or chartered in) is in the Company's\npossession during such period. By definition, available days for an owned vessel equal the calendar days during\na reporting period, unless the vessel is delivered by the yard during the relevant period whereas available days\nfor a chartered-in vessel equal the tenure in days of the underlying time charter agreement, pro-rated to the\nrelevant reporting period if such tenure overlaps more than one reporting period. Offhire days for a vessel\nduring a reporting period is the number of days the vessel is in the Company's possession during such period\nbut is not operational as a result of unscheduled repairs, scheduled dry docking or special or intermediate\nsurveys and lay-ups, if any.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n24\nThree months Three months Three months Nine months Nine months\nended ended ended ended ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(in thousands of $, except for TCE rate and days) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTCE Income Capesize vessels 149,880 148,876 100,370 445,566 265,807\nTCE Income Panamax, Ultramax vessels* 53,761 47,808 55,248 150,084 174,278\nTotal Time charter equivalent income 203,641 196,684 155,618 595,650 440,085\nin days\nFleet onhire days Capesize vessels 5,297 5,316 5,523 16,006 15,614\nFleet onhire days Panamax, Ultramax\nvessels* 3,286 3,041 3,590 9,566 10,964\nTotal Fleet onhire days 8,583 8,357 9,113 25,572 26,578\nin $ per day\nTCE per day Capesize vessels 28,295 28,005 18,173 27,837 17,024\nTCE per day Panamax, Ultramax vessels* 16,361 15,721 15,389 15,689 15,895\nTime charter equivalent rate 23,726 23,535 17,076 23,293 16,558\n* No Ultramax vessels in the Company’s fleet as of September 30, 2024.\nGOLDEN OCEAN GROUP LIMITED, THIRD QUARTER 2024\n25"

This is attributable to our modern, fuel-efficient fleet, strong commercial capabilities, and industry leading low cash-break-even. We continue to execute on our strategy of divesting older and less efficient tonnage at attractive valuations. The macro and geopolitical environment creates volatility in the financial markets and freight market impacting sentiment, despite healthy trading volumes across all commodities. Looking ahead, the freight market is expected to benefit with tonne-mile growth, with the strong iron ore and bauxite exports out of Brazil and Guinea to Asia being the main driver. Combined with a healthy vessel supply outlook we remain optimistic for the years to come. With a modern fleet and strong balance sheet, Golden Ocean is well positioned to generate strong cash flow and attractive returns to our shareholders.”\n\nThe Board of Directors Golden Ocean Group Limited Hamilton, Bermuda November 27, 2024\n\nQuestions should be directed to:\n\nPeder Simonsen: Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS\n\n+47 22 01 73 40\n\nThe full report is available in the link below.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_Matters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

The Company has repurchased a total of 1,507,328 shares under the program for a total consideration of $11,629,758. A total of 741,900 shares have been repurchased at average price of $7.84 per share at Nasdaq and 765,428 shares have been repurchased at an average price of NOK 81.2 at Oslo Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Golden Ocean Group Limited has on 2 October 2024, resolved to extend the existing share buy-back program with a further 12 months and the following main terms:\n\n  * Maximum USD 100 million to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 of the Company’s common shares, with 1,507,328 shares repurchased for USD 11,629,758 as of the date hereof.\n  * A period from and including 5 October 2024 to and including 4 October 2025.\n  * The share buy-backs will be carried out by way of repurchases in the market, both on the Oslo Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq.\n\n\n\nThe Company will report buy-backs carried out continuously and in accordance with the disclosure requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Company is not obligated under the terms of the program to repurchase any of its common shares. The timing and amount of any repurchase will depend on alternative uses of capital, legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, and other factors, in the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n\nPeder Simonsen, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, comments:\n\n“The sentiment in the capital markets and dry bulk freight is volatile and has over the last year been impacted by uncertainty regarding global economic outlook. As a result, GOGL share has in periods been trading at a discount to underlying substance values, despite healthy freight markets. We continue to believe that it is in the shareholders’ interest to extend the authorization to repurchase our common stock as part of its capital allocation strategy. We will opportunistically utilize the extended program as a supplement to our long-term focus on dividend.”\n\n2 October 2024 Hamilton, Bermuda\n\nFor more info please contact: Peder Simonsen, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Golden Ocean Management AS.

Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later, on or about September 23, 2024.\n\n\n\nPeder Simonsen, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, commented:\n\n“Despite a volatile macro and geopolitical backdrop, the dry bulk shipping market remains healthy, and Golden Ocean continues to deliver above-market performance. This is attributable to the quality of our modern, fuel-efficient fleet as well as our strong commercial capabilities. While we continue to opportunistically secure charter coverage, we retain significant exposure to a market we believe will strengthen as the year progresses.\n\nDemand fundamentals in large vessel segments are particularly constructive, with Chinese demand for bauxite and new iron ore export projects under development in the Atlantic Basin are expected to be long-term drivers. The supply side is also favorable as fleet growth is moderating and environmental regulations are expected to constrain effective fleet capacity. Golden Ocean is well positioned to continue to generate strong cash flows, based on our fleet premium and our industry-leading cash breakeven levels. Accordingly, the Company expects to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.”\n\nThe Board of Directors Golden Ocean Group Limited Hamilton, Bermuda August 28, 2024\n\nQuestions should be directed to:\n\nPeder Simonsen: Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS\n\n+47 22 01 73 40\n\nThe full report is available in the link below.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_Matters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or the PSLRA, provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts._\n\n_The Company is taking advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA and is including this cautionary statement in connection therewith. This document and any other written or oral statements made by the Company or on its behalf may include forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. This earnings report includes assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events. These statements are intended as “forward-looking statements.” The Company cautions that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events may and often do vary from actual results and the differences can be material. When used in this document, the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “targets,” “projects,” “likely,” “will,” “would,” “could” and similar expressions or phrases may identify forward-looking statements._\n\n_The forward-looking statements in this report are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company’s records and other data available from third parties. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company’s control, the Company cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. As a result, you are cautioned not to rely on any forward-looking statements._\n\n_In addition to these important factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, important factors that, in the Company’s view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, include among other things: general market trends in the dry bulk industry, which is cyclical and volatile, including fluctuations in charter hire rates and vessel values; a decrease in the market value of the Company’s vessels; changes in supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry, including the market for the Company’s vessels and the number of newbuildings under construction; delays or defaults in the construction of the Company’s newbuildings could increase the Company’s expenses and diminish the Company’s net income and cash flows; an oversupply of dry bulk vessels, which may depress charter rates and profitability; the Company’s future operating or financial results; the Company’s continued borrowing availability under the Company’s debt agreements and compliance with the covenants contained therein; the Company’s ability to procure or have access to financing, the Company’s liquidity and the adequacy of cash flows for the Company’s operations; the failure of the Company’s contract counterparties to meet their obligations, including changes in credit risk with respect to the Company’s counterparties on contracts; the loss of a large customer or significant business relationship; the strength of world economies; the volatility of prevailing spot market and charter-hire charter rates, which may negatively affect the Company’s earnings; the Company’s ability to successfully employ the Company’s dry bulk vessels and replace the Company’s operating leases on favorable terms, or at all; changes in the Company’s operating expenses and voyage costs, including bunker prices, fuel prices (including increased costs for low sulfur fuel), drydocking, crewing and insurance costs; the adequacy of the Company’s insurance to cover the Company’s losses, including in the case of a vessel collision; vessel breakdowns and instances of offhire; the Company’s ability to fund future capital expenditures and investments in the construction, acquisition and refurbishment of the Company’s vessels (including the amount and nature thereof and the timing of completion of vessels under construction, the delivery and commencement of operation dates, expected downtime and lost revenue); risks associated with any future vessel construction or the purchase of second-hand vessels; effects of new products and new technology in the Company’s industry, including the potential for technological innovation to reduce the value of the Company’s vessels and charter income derived therefrom; the impact of an interruption or failure of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, including the impact of cyber-attacks, upon the Company’s ability to operate; potential liability from safety, environmental, governmental and other requirements and potential significant additional expenditures (by the Company and the Company’s customers) related to complying with such regulations; changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities and the impact of government inquiries and investigations; the arrest of the Company’s vessels by maritime claimants; government requisition of the Company’s vessels during a period of war or emergency; the Company’s compliance with complex laws, regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; potential difference in interests between or among certain members of the Board of Directors, executive officers, senior management and shareholders; the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees; work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the Company’s employees or the employees of other companies in related industries; potential exposure or loss from investment in derivative instruments; stability of Europe and the Euro or the inability of countries to refinance their debts; inflationary pressures and the central bank policies intended to combat overall inflation and rising interest rates and foreign exchange rates; fluctuations in currencies; the impact that any discontinuance, modification or other reform or the establishment of alternative reference rates have on the Company’s floating interest rate debt instruments; acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels, public health threats, terrorist attacks and international hostilities and political instability; potential physical disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, climate-related (acute and chronic), political instability, terrorist attacks, piracy, international sanctions or international hostilities, including the developments in the Ukraine region and in the Middle East, including the conflicts in Israel and Gaza, and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea; general domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions or events, including any further changes in U.S. trade policy that could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries; the impact of adverse weather and natural disasters; the impact of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to the Company’s Environmental, Social and Governance policies; changes in seaborne and other transportation; the length and severity of epidemics and pandemics and governmental responses thereto and the impact on the demand for seaborne transportation in the dry bulk sector; impacts of supply chain disruptions and market volatility surrounding impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the developments in the Middle East; fluctuations in the contributions of the Company’s joint ventures to the Company’s profits and losses; the potential for shareholders to not be able to bring a suit against us or enforce a judgement obtained against us in the United States; the Company’s treatment as a “passive foreign investment company” by U.S. tax authorities; being required to pay taxes on U.S. source income; the Company’s operations being subject to economic substance requirements; the Company potentially becoming subject to corporate income tax in Bermuda in the future; the volatility of the stock price for the Company’s common shares, from which investors could incur substantial losses, and the future sale of the Company’s common shares, which could cause the market price of the Company’s common shares to decline; and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n_The Company cautions readers of this report not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of the Company’s future performance, and actual results and future developments may vary materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements._\n\nThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.\n\n[GOGL 2nd Quarter 2024 Results](https://www.goldenocean.bm/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GOGL-2nd-Quarter-2024-Results.pdf)\n\n[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q4 2024 2024, November 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4282/quarterly-report-q4-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q3 2024 Presentation 2024, November 27  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4277/gogl-q3-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Third Quarter 2024 Results 2024, November 27  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4266/gogl-third-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q3 2024 Results 2024, November 18  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4258/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q3-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Renewal of share buy-back program 2024, October 2  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4248/gogl-renewal-of-share-buy-back-program-3/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Company Presentation September 2024 2024, September 12  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4243/gogl-company-presentation-september-2024/)[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q3 2024 2024, September 3  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4237/quarterly-report-q3-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q2 2024 Presentation 2024, August 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4220/gogl-q2-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Second Quarter 2024 Results 2024, August 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4204/gogl-second-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q2 2024 Results 2024, August 20  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4196/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q2-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report 2024, August 8  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4189/gogl-2023-environmental-social-and-governance-esg-report/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Transition of Chief Executive Officer 2024, May 29  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4158/gogl-transition-of-chief-executive-officer/)[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q2 2024 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4143/quarterly-report-q2-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q1 2024 Presentation 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4138/gogl-q1-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – First Quarter 2024 Results 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4128/gogl-first-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q1 2024 Results 2024, May 13  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4117/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q1-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – 2024 AGM Results Notification 2024, April 29  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4089/gogl-2024-agm-results-notification/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Notice of 2024 Annual General Meeting 2024, April 8  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4039/gogl-notice-of-2024-annual-general-meeting/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Notice of Annual General Meeting 2024 2024, March 26  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4035/gogl-notice-of-annual-general-meeting-2024/)[ EVENT  2024 Annual General Meeting 2024, March 26  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4033/2024-annual-general-meeting/)\n\n[ More events  ](/events) [ More news  ](/press-releases)\n"

Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later, on or about June 19, 2024.\n\n\n\nLars-Christian Svensen, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\n“Golden Ocean was well positioned as the new year got underway with significant spot exposure to capture counter-seasonal strength in freight rates during the first quarter of 2024. The freight market and strong year-over-year demand growth offer clear indications that the market is beginning to tighten. Looking forward, the demand outlook is broadly optimistic, firmly supported by limited fleet supply growth, particularly in the Capesize segment. The Company has over the last three years returned over $1 billion, or $5.1 per share in dividends to its shareholders, largely due to the modern fleet and industry low cash break even rates. Given its fleet profile and significant exposure to the trades offering the greatest upside, the Company has the potential to generate significant returns to its shareholders in the coming years.”\n\nThe Board of Directors\n\nGolden Ocean Group Limited\n\nHamilton, Bermuda\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nQuestions should be directed to:\n\nLars-Christian Svensen: Chief Executive Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS\n\n+47 22 01 73 40\n\nPeder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer, Golden Ocean Management AS\n\n+47 22 01 73 40\n\nThe full report is available in the link below.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_Matters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or the PSLRA, provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts._\n\n_The Company is taking advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA and is including this cautionary statement in connection therewith. This document and any other written or oral statements made by the Company or on its behalf may include forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. This earnings report includes assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events. These statements are intended as “forward-looking statements.” The Company cautions that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events may and often do vary from actual results and the differences can be material. When used in this document, the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “targets,” “projects,” “likely,” “will,” “would,” “could” and similar expressions or phrases may identify forward-looking statements._\n\n_The forward-looking statements in this report are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company’s records and other data available from third parties. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company’s control, the Company cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections. As a result, you are cautioned not to rely on any forward-looking statements._\n\n_In addition to these important factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, important factors that, in the Company’s view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, include among other things: general market trends in the dry bulk industry, which is cyclical and volatile, including fluctuations in charter hire rates and vessel values; a decrease in the market value of the Company’s vessels; changes in supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry, including the market for the Company’s vessels and the number of newbuildings under construction; delays or defaults in the construction of the Company’s newbuildings could increase the Company’s expenses and diminish the Company’s net income and cash flows; an oversupply of dry bulk vessels, which may depress charter rates and profitability; the Company’s future operating or financial results; the Company’s continued borrowing availability under the Company’s debt agreements and compliance with the covenants contained therein; the Company’s ability to procure or have access to financing, the Company’s liquidity and the adequacy of cash flows for the Company’s operations; the failure of the Company’s contract counterparties to meet their obligations, including changes in credit risk with respect to the Company’s counterparties on contracts; the loss of a large customer or significant business relationship; the strength of world economies; the volatility of prevailing spot market and charter-hire charter rates, which may negatively affect the Company’s earnings; the Company’s ability to successfully employ the Company’s dry bulk vessels and replace the Company’s operating leases on favorable terms, or at all; changes in the Company’s operating expenses and voyage costs, including bunker prices, fuel prices (including increased costs for low sulfur fuel), drydocking, crewing and insurance costs; the adequacy of the Company’s insurance to cover the Company’s losses, including in the case of a vessel collision; vessel breakdowns and instances of offhire; the Company’s ability to fund future capital expenditures and investments in the construction, acquisition and refurbishment of the Company’s vessels (including the amount and nature thereof and the timing of completion of vessels under construction, the delivery and commencement of operation dates, expected downtime and lost revenue); risks associated with any future vessel construction or the purchase of second-hand vessels; effects of new products and new technology in the Company’s industry, including the potential for technological innovation to reduce the value of the Company’s vessels and charter income derived therefrom; the impact of an interruption or failure of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, including the impact of cyber-attacks, upon the Company’s ability to operate; potential liability from safety, environmental, governmental and other requirements and potential significant additional expenditures (by the Company and the Company’s customers) related to complying with such regulations; changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities and the impact of government inquiries and investigations; the arrest of the Company’s vessels by maritime claimants; government requisition of the Company’s vessels during a period of war or emergency; the Company’s compliance with complex laws, regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; potential difference in interests between or among certain members of the Board of Directors, executive officers, senior management and shareholders; the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees; work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the Company’s employees or the employees of other companies in related industries; potential exposure or loss from investment in derivative instruments; stability of Europe and the Euro or the inability of countries to refinance their debts; inflationary pressures and the central bank policies intended to combat overall inflation and rising interest rates and foreign exchange rates; fluctuations in currencies; acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels, public health threats, terrorist attacks and international hostilities and political instability; potential physical disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, climate-related (acute and chronic), political instability, terrorist attacks, piracy, international sanctions or international hostilities, including the developments in the Ukraine region and in the Middle East, including the conflicts in Israel and Gaza, and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea; general domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions or events, including any further changes in U.S. trade policy that could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries; the impact of adverse weather and natural disasters; the impact of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to the Company’s Environmental, Social and Governance policies; changes in seaborne and other transportation; the length and severity of epidemics and pandemics and governmental responses thereto and the impact on the demand for seaborne transportation in the dry bulk sector; impacts of supply chain disruptions and market volatility surrounding impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the developments in the Middle East; fluctuations in the contributions of the Company’s joint ventures to the Company’s profits and losses; the potential for shareholders to not be able to bring a suit against us or enforce a judgement obtained against us in the United States; the Company’s treatment as a “passive foreign investment company” by U.S. tax authorities; being required to pay taxes on U.S. source income; the Company’s operations being subject to economic substance requirements; the volatility of the stock price for the Company’s common shares, from which investors could incur substantial losses, and the future sale of the Company’s common shares, which could cause the market price of the Company’s common shares to decline; and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n_The Company cautions readers of this report not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of the Company’s future performance, and actual results and future developments may vary materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements._\n\nThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.\n\n[GOGL – 1st Quarter 2024 Results](https://www.goldenocean.bm/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GOGL-1st-Quarter-2024-Results.pdf)\n\n[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q4 2024 2024, November 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4282/quarterly-report-q4-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q3 2024 Presentation 2024, November 27  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4277/gogl-q3-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Third Quarter 2024 Results 2024, November 27  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4266/gogl-third-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q3 2024 Results 2024, November 18  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4258/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q3-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Renewal of share buy-back program 2024, October 2  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4248/gogl-renewal-of-share-buy-back-program-3/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Company Presentation September 2024 2024, September 12  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4243/gogl-company-presentation-september-2024/)[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q3 2024 2024, September 3  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4237/quarterly-report-q3-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q2 2024 Presentation 2024, August 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4220/gogl-q2-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Second Quarter 2024 Results 2024, August 28  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4204/gogl-second-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q2 2024 Results 2024, August 20  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4196/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q2-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report 2024, August 8  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4189/gogl-2023-environmental-social-and-governance-esg-report/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Transition of Chief Executive Officer 2024, May 29  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4158/gogl-transition-of-chief-executive-officer/)[ EVENT  Quarterly Report Q2 2024 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4143/quarterly-report-q2-2024/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Q1 2024 Presentation 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4138/gogl-q1-2024-presentation/)[ NEWS  GOGL – First Quarter 2024 Results 2024, May 22  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4128/gogl-first-quarter-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Invitation to presentation of Q1 2024 Results 2024, May 13  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4117/gogl-invitation-to-presentation-of-q1-2024-results/)[ NEWS  GOGL – 2024 AGM Results Notification 2024, April 29  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4089/gogl-2024-agm-results-notification/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Notice of 2024 Annual General Meeting 2024, April 8  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4039/gogl-notice-of-2024-annual-general-meeting/)[ NEWS  GOGL – Notice of Annual General Meeting 2024 2024, March 26  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/press-release/4035/gogl-notice-of-annual-general-meeting-2024/)[ EVENT  2024 Annual General Meeting 2024, March 26  ](https://www.goldenocean.bm/events/4033/2024-annual-general-meeting/)\n\n[ More events  ](/events) [ More news  ](/press-releases)\n"
