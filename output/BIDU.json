(NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888 (HKD Counter) and 89888 (RMB Counter)), (\"Baidu\" or the \"Company\"), a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"Baidu Core's flattish third quarter top line reflected the ongoing weakness in our online marketing business, offset by the growth of our AI Cloud business. Our strong AI capabilities are gaining broader market recognition, as evidenced by increasing adoption of ERNIE. In intelligent driving, Apollo Go continues to lead the global autonomous ride-hailing market, hitting another milestone with our sixth-generation autonomous vehicle now operating on public roads across multiple cities in China,\" said Robin Li, Co-founder and CEO of Baidu. \"Despite the near-term pressures, we remain steadfast in our AI-focused strategy and are confident in our long-term trajectory. As we further scale AI, we are emboldened to find how it can drive innovations and create value for consumers, enterprises and society at large.\"\n\n\"Our relentless focus on cost control helped support our third quarter results. Baidu Core's operating margins remained stable as we managed to further optimize costs and realize more cost efficiencies between business units,\" said Junjie He, Interim CFO of Baidu. \"AI Cloud continued to show healthy and sustainable development in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Apollo Go continued to make operational strides, underpinning our confidence in the validity of the fully autonomous ride hailing business model.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights [1]**  \n---  \n**Baidu, Inc.**  \n(In millions except per ADS, unaudited)| **Q3**| **Q2**| **Q3**  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2024**|  _**YOY**_|  _**QOQ**_  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**Total revenues**|  34,447| 33,931| 33,557| 4,782|  _(3 %)_| _(1 %)_  \n**Operating income**|  6,274| 5,944| 5,925| 844|  _(6 %)_| _(0 %)_  \n**Operating income (non-GAAP) [2]**| 7,596| 7,500| 7,014| 999|  _(8 %)_| _(6 %)_  \n**Net income to Baidu**|  6,681| 5,488| 7,632| 1,088|  _14 %_| _39 %_  \n**Net income to Baidu (non-GAAP)[2]**| 7,267| 7,396| 5,886| 839| (19 %)| (20 %)  \n**Diluted earnings per ADS**|  18.22| 15.01| 21.60| 3.08| 19 %| 44 %  \n**Diluted earnings per ADS (non-GAAP)[2]**| 20.40| 21.02| 16.60| 2.37| (19 %)| (21 %)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** **[2]**|  9,505| 9,147| 8,733| 1,244| (8 %)| (5 %)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA margin**|  28 %| 27 %| 26 %| 26 %  \n**Baidu Core**  \n(In millions, unaudited)| **Q3**| **Q2**| **Q3**  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2024**|  _**YOY**_|  _**QOQ**_  \n**RMB**| **RMB**| **RMB**| **US$**  \n**Total revenues**|  26,572| 26,687| 26,524| 3,780|  _(0 %)_| _(1 %)_  \n**Operating income**|  5,498| 5,608| 5,694| 811|  _4 %_| _2 %_  \n**Operating income (non-GAAP)[2]**| 6,672| 7,005| 6,652| 948|  _(0 %)_| _(5 %)_  \n**Net income to Baidu Core**|  6,436| 5,462| 7,536| 1,074|  _17 %_| _38 %_  \n**Net income to Baidu Core (non-GAAP)[2]**| 6,956| 7,290| 5,676| 809| (18 %)| (22 %)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA[2]**| 8,513| 8,617| 8,336| 1,188| (2 %)| (3 %)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA margin**|  32 %| 32 %| 31 %| 31 %  \n[1] Unless otherwise noted, RMB to USD was converted at an exchange rate of RMB7.0176 as of September 30, 2024, as set forth in the H.10statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Statements that are not historical facts, including but not limited to statements about Baidu's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Baidu's growth strategies; its future business development, including development of new products and services; its ability to attract and retain users and customers; competition in the Chinese Internet search and newsfeed market; competition for online marketing customers; changes in the Company's revenues and certain cost or expense items as a percentage of its revenues; the outcome of ongoing, or any future, litigation or arbitration, including those relating to intellectual property rights; the expected growth of the Chinese-language Internet search and newsfeed market and the number of Internet and broadband users in China; Chinese governmental policies relating to the Internet and Internet search providers, and general economic conditions in China and elsewhere.

Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of the press release, and Baidu undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Baidu's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Baidu uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu, non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBaidu believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core business operating results, such as operating performance excluding non-cash charges or non-operating in nature. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Baidu's historical performance and liquidity. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company's results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income represents operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu represents net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, disposal gain (loss), impairment of long-term investments, and fair value gain (loss) of long-term investments, adjusted for related income tax effects. Baidu's share of equity method investments for these non-GAAP reconciling items, amortization and impairment of intangible assets not on the investees' books, accretion of their redeemable non-controlling interests, and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by the investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share, adjusted for related income tax effects, are also excluded.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents diluted earnings per ADS calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares expressed in ADS. Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment of intangible assets resulting from business combinations, and share-based compensation expenses.\n\nFor
