The Company’s execution is sustaining progress towards our annual ramp in ARR growth. The Year in Infrastructure 2024 Conference showcased advancements in going digital that are ever more effectively surmounting the infrastructure engineering resource capacity gap. And our strategically significant acquisition of Cesium, with the other strategic initiatives Nicholas and his team have unveiled, exemplifies our reinvigorated prioritization of compelling new growth ambitions.”\n\nCEO Nicholas Cumins said, “During my first 100 days as CEO, we unveiled ambitious strategic moves that will help propel our future growth: the acquisition of 3D geospatial company Cesium; a strategic partnership with Google to integrate their geospatial content; a new product portfolio for asset analytics and a new generation of engineering applications, both leveraging AI and digital twin technologies to improve the way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated. At the same time, we delivered strong quarterly operating results. Our year-over-year ARR growth on a constant currency basis accelerated to 12% in 24Q3 (12.5% excluding China). Strength was broad based across geographies and sectors as we continued to operate at a high level of performance, with favorable end-market conditions for the foreseeable future.”\n\nCFO Werner Andre said, “24Q3’s upward inflection in year-over-year ARR growth is directionally consistent with our expectations for this year’s second half, more than compensating for attrition prevailing stubbornly in China. Growth in subscriptions revenues (now 91% of total revenues) remains robust at 12.4% year-to-date in constant currency, although total revenue growth for 2024 is expected at the lower end of our annual outlook range due to continued declines in Cohesive professional services for Maximo. Profitability and cash flow in the quarter position us well in relation to our profitability outlook and an increased cash flow outlook for the year. In October we entered into a new five-year $1.3 billion bank credit facility with a further $500 million ‘accordion’ feature.”\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * On October 18, 2024, we entered into a new five-year senior secured credit agreement, which provides us with a $1.3 billion revolving credit facility, as well as an incremental $500 million “accordion” feature to increase the facility in the form of both revolving indebtedness and incremental term loans. We used borrowings under the revolving credit facility to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our previous credit facility, including our outstanding term loan;\n  * On October 9, 2024, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to integrate Google's high-quality geospatial content with Bentley's infrastructure engineering software and digital twin platform to improve the ways infrastructure is designed, built, and operated “in context”; and\n  * On September 6, 2024, we announced the acquisition of 3D geospatial company Cesium. Cesium is recognized as the foundational open platform for creating immersive 3D geospatial environments, and its 3D Tiles open standard has been widely adopted by leading enterprises, governments, and tens of thousands of application developer teams globally.\n\n\n\n**Call Details**\n\nBentley Systems will host a live Zoom video webinar on November 7, 2024 at 8:15 a.m. EST to discuss results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThose wishing to participate should access the live Zoom video webinar of the event through a direct registration link at [https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ZlTBingnQoKzZgcRVSRB8w#/registration](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus06web.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2FWN_ZlTBingnQoKzZgcRVSRB8w%23%2Fregistration&esheet=54147640&newsitemid=20241107704708&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fus06web.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2FWN_ZlTBingnQoKzZgcRVSRB8w%23%2Fregistration&index=2&md5=2cbc55e59089643269df33b8984a7b7f).

Other Financial Measures**\n\nConstant currency\n\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A significant amount of our operations is conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance.\n\nIn reporting period-over-period results, except for ARR as discussed further below, we calculate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information by translating current and prior period results on a transactional basis to our reporting currency using prior period average foreign currency exchange rates in which the transactions occurred.\n\nRecurring revenues\n\n _Recurring revenues_ are the basis for our other revenue-related key business metrics. We believe this measure is useful in evaluating our ability to consistently retain and grow our revenues from accounts with revenues in the prior period (“existing accounts”).\n\n_Recurring revenues_ are subscriptions revenues that recur monthly, quarterly, or annually with specific or automatic renewal clauses and professional services revenues in which the underlying contract is based on a fixed fee and contains automatic annual renewal provisions.\n\nAnnualized recurring revenues (“ARR”)\n\n_ARR_ is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating the scale and growth of our business as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. Furthermore, we believe _ARR_ , considered in connection with our _last twelve-month recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate_ , is a leading indicator of revenue growth.\n\n_ARR_ is defined as the sum of the annualized value of our portfolio of contracts that produce recurring revenues as of the last day of the reporting period, and the annualized value of the last three months of recognized revenues for our contractually recurring consumption-based software subscriptions with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, calculated using the spot foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the last three months of recognized revenues, on an annualized basis, for our recurring software subscriptions with consumption measurement period durations of less than one year is a reasonable estimate of the annual revenues, given our consistently high retention rate and stability of usage under such subscriptions.\n\n_Constant currency ARR growth rate_ is the growth rate of _ARR_ measured on a constant currency basis. In reporting period-over-period ARR growth rates in constant currency, we calculate constant currency growth rates by translating current and prior period ARR on a transactional basis to our reporting currency using current year budget exchange rates. _Constant currency ARR growth rate from business performance_ excludes the _ARR_ onboarding of our _platform acquisitions_ and includes the impact from the _ARR_ onboarding of _programmatic acquisitions_ , which generally are immaterial, individually and in the aggregate. We believe these ARR growth rates are important metrics indicating the scale and growth of our business.\n\nLast twelve-month recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate\n\n _Last twelve-month recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate_ is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating our ability to consistently retain and grow our recurring revenues.\n\n_Last twelve-month recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate_ is calculated, using the average exchange rates for the prior period, as follows: the recurring revenues for the current period, including any growth or reductions from existing accounts, but excluding recurring revenues from any new accounts added during the current period, divided by the total recurring revenues from all accounts during the prior period. A period is defined as any trailing twelve months. Related to our _platform acquisitions_ , recurring revenues into new accounts will be captured as existing accounts starting with the second anniversary of the acquisition when such data conforms to the calculation methodology. This may cause variability in the comparison.\n\nAdjusted operating income inclusive of stock-based compensation expense (“Adjusted OI w/SBC”)\n\n_Adjusted OI w/SBC_ is a non-GAAP financial measure and is used to measure the operational strength and performance of our business, as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business.\n\n_Adjusted OI w/SBC_ is our primary performance measure, which excludes certain expenses and charges, including the non-cash amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of intangible assets, as we believe these may not be indicative of the Company’s core business operating results. We intentionally include stock-based compensation expense in this measure as we believe it better captures the economic costs of our business.\n\nManagement uses this non-GAAP financial measure to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate financial performance, and in our comparison of our financial results to those of other companies. It is also a significant performance measure in certain of our executive incentive compensation programs.\n\n_Adjusted OI w/SBC_ is defined as operating income adjusted for the following: amortization of purchased intangibles, expense (income) relating to deferred compensation plan liabilities, acquisition expenses, and realignment expenses (income), for the respective periods.\n\n_Adjusted OI w/SBC margin_ is calculated by dividing _Adjusted OI w/SBC_ by total revenues.\n\nAdjusted operating income\n\n _Adjusted operating income_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors in making comparisons to other companies, although this measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\n\n_Adjusted operating income_ is defined as operating income adjusted for the following: amortization of purchased intangibles, expense (income) relating to deferred compensation plan liabilities, acquisition expenses, realignment expenses (income), and stock-based compensation expense, for the respective periods.\n\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted EPS\n\n _Adjusted net income_ and _Adjusted EPS_ are non-GAAP financial measures presenting the earnings generated by our ongoing operations that we believe is useful to investors in making meaningful comparisons to other companies, although these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies, and period-over-period comparisons.\n\n_Adjusted net income_ is defined as net income adjusted for the following: amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, expense (income) relating to deferred compensation plan liabilities, acquisition expenses, realignment expenses (income), other non-operating (income) expense, net, the tax effect of the above adjustments to net income, and equity in net (income) losses of investees, net of tax, for the respective periods. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments was determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which income or expense occurred, and represent both current and deferred income tax expense or benefit based on the nature of the non-GAAP adjustments, including the tax effects of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\n_Adjusted EPS_ is calculated as _Adjusted net income_ , less net income attributable to participating securities, plus interest expense, net of tax, attributable to the convertible senior notes using the if-converted method, if applicable, (numerator) divided by _Adjusted weighted average shares, diluted_ (denominator). _Adjusted weighted average shares, diluted_ is calculated by adding incremental shares related to the dilutive effect of convertible senior notes using the if-converted method, if applicable, to weighted average shares, diluted.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n _Adjusted EBITDA_ is our liquidity measure in the context of conversion of _Adjusted EBITDA_ to cash flow from operations (i.e., the ratio of GAAP cash flow from operations to _Adjusted EBITDA_). We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to repay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and return capital to investors.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_ is defined as cash flow from operations adjusted for the following: cash interest, cash taxes, cash deferred compensation plan distributions, cash acquisition expenses, cash realignment costs, changes in operating assets and liabilities, and other cash items (such as those related to our interest rate swap). From time to time, we may exclude from _Adjusted EBITDA_ the impact of certain cash receipts or payments that affect period-to-period comparability.\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107704708r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107704708/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107704708/en/)\n\nInvestors: Eric Boyer, IR@bentley.com\n\nSource: Bentley Systems, Incorporated\n\n[ FAQs ](/shareholder-services/investor-faqs)\n\n**FAQs**\n\n[ Email Alerts ](/shareholder-services/email-alerts)\n\n**Email Alerts**\n\n[ Information Request ](/shareholder-services/information-request)\n\n**Information Request**\n\n[ RSS Feeds ](/shareholder-services/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS Feeds**\n\n##### Connect with us on social media.\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BentleySystems) [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/company/bentley-systems) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bentleysystems) [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/BentleySystems) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bentleysystems/)\n"
